The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nUnder a state law, oil and gas rights can pass by will or through intestate succession. Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n",

            "explanation": "The state has a legitimate interest in promoting the development of oil and gas resources in the state. The law is a reasonable means to that end because it promotes the efficient use of oil and gas resources by allowing contracts to be entered into with a smaller number of owners, and thus more easily. The law does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce because the state has a legitimate interest in the development of oil and gas resources in the state, and the law is a reasonable means to that end."

            "question_number": 1,
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nThe owner of a local road-paving company has for several years provided road repair and maintenance services for a small town under an annual contract. The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD. Yes, because the mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration\u2019s policies.\nResponse:\n",

            "question_number": 6,
            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nCongress amended the federal bankruptcy statute to allow states to exempt a debtor\u2019s home from judgment creditors, so long as the debtor had established permanent residency in the state at least two years before entry of the judgment. The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law. Which of the following is the man\u2019s best argument?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Automobile negligence is not a commercial activity and is therefore beyond the regulatory power of Congress pursuant to the commerce clause.\nB. Congress cannot commandeer a state legislature to enact a law implementing federal policy.\nC. Congress lacks the power to authorize the states to enact such restrictions based on the length of a person\u2019s residence within a state.\nD. The two-year time period is too long to be rationally related to the prevention of fraud against creditors.\nResponse:\n",

It regulates bankruptcy proceedings, which is within Congress\u2019s power to legislate in Article I. Answer B is incorrect. The federal statute does not violate the no-commandeering principle because it authorizes rather than requires states to create durational residency requirements. Answer D is incorrect.

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA city owned and operated an electric utility that supplied electricity to the city\u2019s businesses and residences. Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss. While the city\u2019s motion was pending, the city council passed an emergency ordinance requiring both prior notice and property owner consent before the removal or replacement of any electric meter. Should the court grant the city\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the city\u2019s action is capable of repetition yet evading review.\nB.

Answer A is incorrect. \u201cCapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d applies only in situations where litigation is unlikely to be completed because of the short-term nature of an issue, such as review of an explicitly short-term legal mandate. Answer B is incorrect. The voluntary cessation exception does not apply when it is unreasonable to expect that the allegedly unlawful conduct will recur.

By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory. Such facially discriminatory laws are allowed only in the absence of any nondiscriminatory way to promote the government\u2019s interest. C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994). Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest.

No, because the fee provision violates the privileges and immunities clause.\nB. No, because the law takes the owner\u2019s property without just compensation.\nC. Yes, because the fee provides the owner with just compensation.\nD. Yes, because the law has the public purpose of promoting tourism.\nResponse:\n",

            "explanation": "The Constitution prohibits the government from taking private property for public use without just compensation. This is known as the Takings Clause. The Takings Clause is not absolute, however, and the government may take private property for public use if it provides the owner with just compensation. Here, the fee the owner can charge hikers to use the historic trail is just compensation. The owner is not being deprived of his property because he is still allowed to use the land for his own purposes. The fee is simply a way for the owner to recoup the costs of allowing the public to use his land. The fee does not violate the Takings Clause because it provides the owner with just compensation."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land. Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here. Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue. Answer D is incorrect. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the taking serves a public purpose.",

Is the law valid as applied to the woman?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law cannot be applied retroactively to crimes committed before its passage.\nB. No, because the law fails to provide any standard for the court to use in passing sentence and thus violates procedural due process.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A law that increases the punishment for a crime after the crime was committed violates the ex post facto clause. The law here was passed after the woman committed the crime, so the law may not be applied to her.      Answer B is incorrect. Procedural due process requires that the government provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before depriving someone of a liberty interest or of an interest in property. The woman received that notice prior to trial, and the law provides an opportunity for a hearing. However, the law is an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to the woman. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest is not the proper standard. The ex post facto clause is violated by laws that increase the punishment for a crime after the crime was committed, even if the law furthers a legitimate interest. Answer D is incorrect. The law constitutes punishment because it increases the consequences for having been found guilty of committing a crime, and the law increases the punishment for the crime after the woman committed the crime, violating the ex post facto clause.",

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nThe number of large billboards along a city\u2019s major roadways has increased considerably in recent years. Many political groups have contributed to that increase with their growing use of billboards to display messages that further a variety of political candidates and public causes. The city council has received many complaints from residents claiming that the billboards are ugly and detract from picturesque sights along the roadways. In response to these complaints, the city council has enacted an ordinance that substantially limits the number and the size of billboards that may be erected along designated scenic roadways. A company that owns many of the billboards affected by this ordinance has filed suit, claiming that the ordinance violates the company\u2019s freedom of speech. Should the court uphold the ordinance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the ordinance burdens political speech and is not necessary to further a compelling government interest.\nB. No, because the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

Answer C is incorrect. It states the incorrect standard of review for the city\u2019s denial of the permit. The existence of alternative opportunities would only be relevant in a case involving a content-neutral restriction on speech.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

The owner of the complex has applied to the city for a permit to construct an additional apartment building on the site. The city has told the owner that it will approve the permit only if the owner makes the swimming pool available to all residents of the neighborhood. The purpose of the condition is to compensate neighborhood residents for the increased street traffic that will result from the tenants of the new building. Is the permit condition constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because requiring the owner to open the pool to all neighborhood residents violates the freedom of association of the current tenants of the complex.\nB. No, because there is no logical nexus between the permit condition and the city\u2019s concern with increased street traffic.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations is not the proper standard. Because the government is demanding public access to the property in exchange for a permit to build, the test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Answer D is incorrect. Whether or not the condition substantially advances a legitimate interest of the city is not the proper standard.

King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency.

That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed.

Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a parolee has no privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. No, because the parolee was not in custody.\nC. Yes, because Miranda warnings are required before interrogation by law enforcement officers.\nD. Yes, because the parolee\u2019s statements were compelled, as he could reasonably believe that he was required to answer questions asked by his parole officer.\nResponse:\n",

            "explanation": "The parole officer's questioning of the parolee was not interrogation, but rather an informal inquiry into the parolee's criminal history. This inquiry was not conducted to elicit incriminating evidence, but rather to obtain information that would help the parole officer to determine whether the parolee was complying with the conditions of his parole. Thus, the parolee's statement to the parole officer was not compelled. Miranda warnings are required when a suspect is in custody and is being interrogated by law enforcement officers. The parolee was not in custody, and was not being interrogated by law enforcement officers. Thus, Miranda warnings were not required."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. A Miranda warning is required whenever a suspect is (1) in custody and (2) being subjected to custodial interrogation. Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers. However, as the Court held in Minnesota v. Murphy, neither of those entitlements transforms the exchange into a custodial interrogation.",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nOver the course of a year, police in a small town received complaints about vandalism in public parks. They connected the incidents because the vandal left specific graffiti at each site, and investigation provided the police with a reasonable suspicion that the perpetrator was a specific local resident. Using an online directory that the resident had joined, the police obtained the resident\u2019s cell- phone number. The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB. No, because the subpoena was based on a cell- phone number that the resident had voluntarily placed in the public domain.\nC. Yes, because a subpoena must be based on probable cause.\nD. Yes, because a warrant is required to collect such extensive historical cell-phone site- location data.\nResponse:\n",

            "explanation": "The police had a reasonable suspicion that the resident was the vandal, based on the graffiti and the fact that the resident had been in the vicinity of each incident. The police had a valid subpoena to the cell-phone provider, which is a third party that the resident had no reasonable expectation of privacy in. The subpoena was based on probable cause. The Fourth Amendment requires a warrant for a search, but a warrant is not required for a subpoena.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing.

In the course of the robbery, the first man shot and killed a teller. The police arrived and arrested both men as they were leaving the bank. The men were charged with felony murder and tried separately. The first man (the actual shooter) was tried and convicted, but the jury refused to sentence him to death, so he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The second man was also tried and convicted. The prosecution agreed, based on medical records, that he was intellectually disabled with an IQ of only 60. The jury nonetheless sentenced the second man to death. Is the second man\u2019s death sentence constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is constitutionally disproportionate in light of the lesser sentence imposed on the actual shooter.\nB. No, because of the second man\u2019s intellectual disability.\nC. No, because the second man was not the actual shooter.\nD. Yes.\nResponse:\n",

The appellate court reversed the conviction based on an erroneous evidentiary ruling. May the defendant properly be retried on the original charge of first-degree murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the jury effectively acquitted the defendant of first-degree murder.\nB. No, because the vindictive-prosecution doctrine precludes punishing the defendant for taking the appeal.\nC.

The problem is not that the prosecutor would be enhancing the charges; it is that the jury has already acquitted the defendant of the primary count.

Three witnesses testified for the state that the defendant approached the victim in a bar, engaged in a brief conversation with him, and then, without warning, drew a gun and shot the victim in the stomach. One witness for the state testified that just before the defendant drew his gun and shot the victim, the victim twice kicked the defendant in the groin. The state\u2019s evidence clearly established that the victim died as a result of the gunshot wound. The defendant did not testify or offer any evidence. The defendant requested that the jury be instructed on voluntary manslaughter based upon heat of passion from adequate provocation. The state argued that murder should be the only form of homicide submitted. Should the court instruct on voluntary manslaughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant did not meet his burden of producing evidence of heat of passion from adequate provocation.\nB. No, because the weight of the evidence indicated that the victim did nothing amounting to adequate provocation.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct because a reasonable jury could find that the defendant was twice kicked in the groin by the victim prior to the homicide, and on that basis could conclude that the defendant had adequate provocation. Even      though it is a single witness who recounts this event, a jury can credit a single witness\u2019s testimony. Answer A is incorrect because the state offered evidence of a serious battery on the defendant, which can constitute an adequate provocation, no matter which party presented the evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the judge\u2019s job is not to weigh the evidence but is only to determine whether a reasonable jury could find adequate provocation. The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis.

After trial, defense counsel learned that the prosecution had failed to disclose that the key witness against the defendant had previously been convicted of perjury in another case. The defense filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court rejected the defense argument and upheld the conviction because state discovery rules did not require the disclosure.

Can the state appellate court overturn the conviction based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the witness\u2019s prior perjury conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery is regulated by state rather than federal procedure.\nB. No, because the prior conviction was mere impeachment rather than evidence of actual innocence.\nC.

If the failure to disclose that information created a reasonable probability of a different outcome, then the appellate court should reverse the conviction. Answer A is incorrect because, although generally discovery is governed by state rules, the due process clause contains some core rights, such as the right to disclosure of critical exculpatory evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the scope of due process is not limited to proof of actual innocence. The government must disclose any evidence favorable to the defendant that could affect the outcome of the case.

If the appeals court finds that the trial court should not have admitted the testimony, does it have the authority to reverse a conviction when the trial attorney raised no objection to the challenged testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because failure to object waives a defendant\u2019s rights.\nB. No, because the sole remedy is a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nC.

At the time of the resale, the friend looked at the odometer, which read 30,000 miles, and said, \u201cGreat!\u201d By then, the actual mileage was 95,000. Immediately after buying the car, the friend took it to his mechanic, who completed minor repairs and told the friend that he estimated the car\u2019s actual mileage to be approximately 100,000. Assuming no applicable statutes, is the friend likely to prevail in an action to rescind his purchase of the car from the woman?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the friend\u2019s reliance on the odometer reading was unreasonable, given that he did not have his mechanic check the mileage before he bought the car.\nB. No, because the woman was unaware of the car\u2019s actual mileage when she sold the car to the friend.\nC. Yes, because the car\u2019s actual mileage is a material fact that was not revealed to the friend before he bought the car.\nD. Yes, because the car\u2019s odometer reading constituted an express warranty.\nResponse:\n",

Here, the misrepresentation about the car\u2019s mileage was not fraudulent, since the woman made it innocently, but it was material. Answer A is incorrect. The friend had no duty to have a mechanic check the mileage when his reliance on the odometer reading was reasonable. Answer B is incorrect. Because the woman was unaware of the actual mileage, the misrepresentation was not fraudulent, but an innocent misrepresentation is grounds for avoidance of a contract when the misrepresentation is material.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife.

If the parties take their dispute to court and both ask the court to supply the missing term, how will the court likely proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It will rescind the agreement, because the terms of an agreement are for the parties to draft, not the court, and the parties apparently failed to execute a complete agreement.\nB.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nThe owner of a house leased it to a tenant for a one- year term. A provision in the lease stated that the owner had the right to place \u201cFor Rent\u201d signs on the premises during the last 90 days of the lease term if the lease was not renewed. The lease also required the tenant to permit prospective lessees to enter and examine the premises during the 90-day period but did not address the owner\u2019s right to enter the premises for purposes of showing the house to prospective lessees. The tenant decided not to renew the lease, and at the beginning of the 90-day period, the owner told the tenant that she was going to show the house to a prospective lessee. The tenant refused to allow the owner to enter the house but said that the prospective lessee could enter.

A duty of good faith and fair dealing arises in contracts where one party has an advantage over another party. The owner, having the advantage of leasing the house, is obligated to deal with the tenant in good faith and to act in a manner that would be fair to the tenant. The tenant's refusal to allow the owner to enter the house is not supported by the principle of reasonable expectations, as that principle is not relevant in this scenario. The duty to use best efforts is also not relevant to this scenario, as there is no requirement for the owner to use best efforts to find a new lessee. The objective theory of contracts does not apply in this scenario, as there is no contract in question."

The lease does not explicitly say that the owner may enter the house to show it to prospective lessees, but such a right may be fairly implied in order to carry out the intention of the parties. Answer A is incorrect. The principle of reasonable expectations posits that parties should not be bound by terms that they would not expect to find in a contract unless those terms were called to their attention. That doctrine is not relevant here. Answer C is incorrect. Best efforts is a duty read into a contract to prevent it from being illusory when the scope of a party\u2019s performance is omitted or unclear. The duty of best efforts, which requires all parties to use their best efforts to carry out the intent of the contract, is not relevant here. Answer D is incorrect.

The buyer refused and told the seller that she would purchase lumber elsewhere.

As discussed above, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to do the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for damages against the bank, as an intended beneficiary. Answer C is incorrect. The bank is not an incidental beneficiary. Instead the bank is an intended beneficiary that can enforce a contract to which it is not a party because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302. Answer D is incorrect. As an intended beneficiary, the bank can assert the carpenter\u2019s rights under the contract. Here, the carpenter\u2019s breach was not material, so the homeowner\u2019s obligation was not discharged. And even if the carpenter\u2019s breach was material, the bank could recover the value of the work done for the homeowner as restitution. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374.",

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3.

The contract stated that the man would pay the contractor $60,000 when the foundation was laid, $60,000 when the house was framed, $60,000 when the walls were completed, and $20,000 when the house was finished. After the contractor laid the foundation and expended $50,000, but before the man paid the contractor anything, the contractor quit the project to take a higher-paying job. Subject to the man\u2019s claim for damages for breach, how much is the contractor likely to recover for the work he performed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $50,000, on a theory of reliance.\nB. $60,000, on a theory of divisible contract.\nC. The value of the benefit conferred, on a theory of restitution.\nD. Nothing, because the contractor\u2019s breach was willful.\nResponse:\n",

The contractor was not entitled to rely on the man's promise to pay because the man had not yet paid anything, and the contractor's reliance on the man's promise to pay was not reasonable. The contractor was entitled to recover $50,000 for the work he performed, because the man's promise to pay was not conditioned on the contractor's performance."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. A party that materially breaches a contract is nevertheless entitled to recover under a theory of restitution the amount of the value of the benefit that the breaching party\u2019s part performance conferred on the victim of the breach. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374. Answer A is incorrect. A breaching party cannot recover on a theory of reliance. Answer B is incorrect. This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 240. Answer D is incorrect. Contract law generally does not distinguish between willful breaches and other breaches. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374; Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 12.3. This situation would not require a court to consider the reason for breach.",

If a buyer repudiates a contract for unfinished goods, the seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment proceed in any reasonable manner, including finishing the goods for resale. UCC \u00a7 2- 704(2). The seller\u2019s damages in that situation are the difference between the contract price and the resale price. UCC \u00a7 2- 706(1). Here that amount is $8,000. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale. Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale rather than seeking costs and lost profit. Note that this has the effect of reducing the seller\u2019s damages.      Answer D is incorrect. In the common law case of Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co., 35 F.2d 301 (4th Cir. 1929), the court held that the seller had a duty not to complete a bridge after the buyer repudiated. But UCC Article Two has a different rule, because unlike a completed bridge, completed goods can be resold to avoid or reduce loss.",

Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3.

Under FRE 408(a)(2), statements made during settlement negotiations in a private civil action\u2014negotiations not involving a public office\u2014are inadmissible in a subsequent criminal case arising out of the same incident. Answer A is incorrect. When offered by the prosecution, the driver\u2019s statement to the woman is a statement of an opposing party, and therefore it would come within the exception to the hearsay rule set out in FRE 801(d)(2)(A). Answer C is incorrect. FRE 408(a)(2) distinguishes between settlement negotiations involving private parties and those involving a public office. Statements made in negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its enforcement authority may be admissible in a subsequent criminal case. But statements made in negotiations with a private party are not admissible in a subsequent criminal prosecution. Answer D is incorrect. The statement is inadmissible under FRE 408(b)(2).

Because the fire marshal is a public official and his conclusion about the cause of the fire is a factual finding based upon an official investigation, the report is admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. The witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception, however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement must be excised from the report. Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under      a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation protects defendants only in criminal cases and so does not protect the neighbor in this civil action. Answer D is incorrect. Public officials may rely on bystander statements and hearsay in making factual findings. To the extent that a public official\u2019s factual findings rest on only such hearsay, those findings could be excluded for a lack of trustworthiness under FRE 803(8)(B).

One year later, a fire completely destroyed the woman\u2019s house and its contents, and she learned that the policy covered the cost of rebuilding the house but not the cost of replacing the contents. The woman sued the insurance company for breach of contract, claiming that when the agent sold her the policy, he did not notify her, as was legally required, that she would have to purchase a supplemental policy to cover the house\u2019s contents. At trial, the woman testified that the agent had not provided the required notice. The agent\u2019s supervisor plans to testify that the company issues thousands of policies through its agents each year and that it is the routine practice of those agents to discuss supplemental policy options with each customer. The woman\u2019s attorney has objected to this proffered testimony. Should the court allow the supervisor\u2019s testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because evidence of routine practice is not admissible when an eyewitness denies that the practice was followed.\nB.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA defendant has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson and insurance fraud after his restaurant burned to the ground late one night. At trial, the prosecutor presents evidence that, two days before the fire, the defendant paid $10,000 to a man who was later seen entering the restaurant shortly before the fire started. The man has invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refuses to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial. The prosecutor calls the man\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who testifies that on the day of the fire, she noticed that the man seemed nervous and asked him what was wrong. She says that he told her, \u201cI\u2019m getting paid $10,000 to burn down a restaurant tonight, and I\u2019m a little nervous about it.\u201d The defendant objects to the admission of the man\u2019s statement to the fianc\u00e9e, relying on the hearsay rule and the confrontation clause. Is the man\u2019s statement to the fianc\u00e9e admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the man\u2019s statement is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the man\u2019s statement is testimonial, so admitting it would violate the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.\nC. Yes, because the man\u2019s statement is a nontestimonial declaration against penal interest.\nD. Yes, because the man\u2019s statement is a nontestimonial statement by a coconspirator.\nResponse:\n",

In rebuttal, the prosecutor proposes to call the investigator, who would testify that the girlfriend told him in their interview that the defendant had left the house by 8 a.m. on the day of the robbery. The defendant objects to the investigator\u2019s proposed testimony about the girlfriend\u2019s prior statement. Should the court allow the investigator\u2019s testimony about the girlfriend\u2019s prior statement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Answer A is incorrect. FRE 613(b) permits proof of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence so long as the witness has an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Here, the girlfriend had that opportunity and denied the statement, making proof of the statement by extrinsic evidence permissible. Answer B is incorrect.

FRE 704(b)\u2019s prohibition on expert testimony about a defendant\u2019s mental state applies to both parties\u2019 experts in a criminal case. Answer D is incorrect. An expert may testify that a defendant suffered from schizophrenia but may not testify that the defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. The latter testimony is barred by FRE 704(b).",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA company hired an attorney to sue a former company manager for violating a covenant not to compete. The company\u2019s president told the attorney that the manager had begun working for a competitor and gave the attorney a copy of the signed covenant. The attorney brought a federal diversity action against the manager and attached to the complaint a copy of the signed covenant. The attorney also moved for a preliminary injunction, referring to the attached covenant and submitting a supporting affidavit from the company\u2019s president. At the hearing on the preliminary injunction motion, the manager denied ever having signed such a covenant and conclusively demonstrated that the copy of a signed covenant attached to the company\u2019s motion was forged. The court, on its own initiative, ordered the attorney to show cause why the attorney should not be sanctioned under Rule 11. Would sanctions against the attorney be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the court did not give the attorney notice and 21 days to withdraw the preliminary injunction motion.\nB. No, because the motion was supported by evidence that was likely sufficient to satisfy an objectively reasonable attorney.\nC. Yes, because the attorney filed papers with the court that contained untrue assertions of fact.\nD. Yes, because the attorney should have verified the manager\u2019s signature before attaching the covenant to the complaint.\nResponse:\n",

            "explanation": "The manager's denial of signing the covenant, coupled with the fact that the attorney submitted the affidavit from the company's president, clearly shows that the attorney should have been aware of the fact that the covenant was likely not valid. The attorney had a duty to verify the manager's signature, and clearly did not do so. The attorney also failed to withdraw the motion after the manager presented evidence that the covenant was likely not valid. The attorney's actions clearly constitute a violation of Rule 11, and sanctions should be imposed."

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) requires that factual contentions presented by an attorney to the court have evidentiary support. Attorneys may rely on affidavits and documents provided by their clients unless the circumstances suggest that it would be unreasonable to do so or that further inquiry is needed. Answer A is incorrect. The \u201csafe harbor\u201d requirement in Rule 11 applies only when a party moves for sanctions, not when the court acts on its own initiative. Answer C is incorrect. Under Rule 11(b), attorneys certify that factual contentions they present to the court have evidentiary support, not that they are true. As indicated above, there is nothing in the facts suggesting that the attorney should have questioned either the signed covenant or the president\u2019s affidavit as containing false information. Answer D is incorrect. There is no general rule requiring attorneys to verify signatures on documents before presenting them to a court. Rather, the inquiry under Rule 11(b) is whether the attorney acted to the best of the attorney\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry under the circumstances. Here, there are no facts given that suggest that it would have been unreasonable for the attorney to assume that the signature on the covenant was valid.",

The complaint alleged breach of contract claims arising from construction delays and deficient electrical work that had caused the corporation significant financial losses. The general contractor filed a crossclaim against the subcontractor, asserting only the defense that the general contractor was not liable to the corporation because the subcontractor\u2019s deficient work was the sole cause of the construction delays and the corporation\u2019s losses. After discovery, the corporation settled with the general contractor and dismissed the claims against it. The subcontractor has moved to dismiss the general contractor\u2019s crossclaim. Which of the following arguments best supports the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The crossclaim is improper, because it asserts a defense, not a claim for relief.\nB. The crossclaim is improper, because the general contractor and the subcontractor are opposing parties, not co-parties.\nC. The crossclaim is invalid, because the general contractor is no longer a party to the underlying action.\nD.

There is no authority under Rule 13(g) to allow an attempt to assert a defense against the plaintiff so as to shift direct liability for damages owed to the plaintiff to a codefendant. Answer B is incorrect. The general contractor and the subcontractor were both joined by the corporation as defendants.      That makes them codefendants under Rule 13(g). Answer C is incorrect. Even if the corporation\u2019s claim against the general contractor has been dismissed, as long as the crossclaim remains undetermined, the general contractor and the subcontractor remain in the suit for purposes of that claim. Answer D is incorrect. Rule 13(g) specifically provides that a crossclaim may include a claim that the co-party is or \u201cmay be\u201d liable for all or part of the claim asserted in the main action.

After the motions deadline expired, and a month before jury selection and trial, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney moved for a six-month extension of the discovery, motions, and jury-trial deadlines. The attorney explained that she had been so busy that she had been unable to depose key witnesses or discuss settlement options with her client. The defendant objected to the extension on the ground that there had been ample time to prepare and that the delay would result in increased costs. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the attorney has not shown good cause for the delay.\nB. No, because the court has set the date for jury selection.\nC.

Answer B is incorrect. If the moving party shows good cause, the court can amend any of the dates or deadlines in the scheduling order, including the trial date or the date for jury selection. Answer C is incorrect. Whether additional time could facilitate a settlement is immaterial, because it does not speak to whether the moving party can show the required diligence needed to establish good cause. Answer D is incorrect. The busy schedule of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not establish the good cause needed to amend the scheduling order, which is why the motion should be denied.

However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond.

There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nAfter a lengthy federal trial, the defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL). The court denied the motion and sent the case to the jury, which returned a verdict for the plaintiff and awarded damages. Five weeks after the court entered judgment on the verdict, the defendant filed a renewed motion for JMOL. One week after that motion was filed, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to extend the time to file and respond to posttrial motions. In the stipulation, the defendant acknowledged that it had filed its renewed JMOL motion late, citing computer difficulties relating to an office move. The plaintiff has acknowledged that it suffered no prejudice as a result of the late renewal motion but opposes it. Is the court likely to consider the renewed JMOL motion on the merits?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the deadline for filing a renewed JMOL motion cannot be extended.\nB. No, because the defendant failed to show good cause for its delay in filing the motion.\nC. Yes, because although the motion was late, the defendant explained the reason, and the plaintiff suffered no prejudice.\nD. Yes, because although the motion was late, the parties agreed to extend the time for posttrial motions.\nResponse:\n",

If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA train conductor brought an action against her railroad employer under a federal statute providing liability for work-related injuries occurring on railroads. The employer denied liability, claiming that the conductor\u2019s injuries pre-dated her employment and were outside the scope of the statute. At the close of the evidence at trial, the employer moved for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), which the court denied. The jury returned a verdict for the conductor. The employer has renewed its JMOL motion. What standard should the court apply in ruling on the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Whether a preponderance of the evidence supports the verdict.\nB.

The standard for granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) is whether the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict. A motion for JMOL is appropriate only when the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict. The evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. The evidence must be sufficient to support the verdict if the jury could find for the plaintiff. The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.

The employee sued the agency in federal court for employment discrimination. The employee agreed with the agency to settle the action in return for 12 monthly settlement payments. The agreement, however, was based on the employee\u2019s mistaken assumption that the settlement payments would constitute \u201cearnable salary\u201d under state law, entitling the employee to retire with 30 years of service at a higher pension rate.

The employee promptly moved to reopen the judgment on the ground of mistake. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because mistake is not a ground on which a court may reopen a judgment.\nB. No, because the employee did not file the motion within one year of the court\u2019s entry of judgment.\nC.

She fell behind in her mortgage loan payments, and the bank properly initiated foreclosure proceedings. The land was sold at a foreclosure sale that resulted in surplus proceeds to which the woman was entitled. Before payment of the surplus proceeds to her, she died testate. In her duly probated will, which she had executed before granting the mortgage to the bank, the woman specifically devised the land to a charity.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA landlord owns a 10-unit apartment building and lives in one of the apartments. A uniformly enforced provision in every apartment lease prohibits all pets. A tenant with a serious hearing impairment asked permission from the landlord to keep a hearing-assistance service dog in her apartment to alert and assist her in the event of fire or other emergency. The landlord refused. Is the landlord\u2019s refusal likely a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the landlord lives in an apartment in the building.\nB. No, because the tenant agreed to the \u201cno pets\u201d provision in her lease.\nC. Yes, because the landlord\u2019s refusal is arbitrary.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The tenant has a serious hearing impairment, which is a handicap under the Fair Housing Act. The Act requires the landlord to make a reasonable accommodation for such a handicap, and the tenant\u2019s need for a trained service dog outweighs any concerns underlying the landlord\u2019s prohibition of pets. Answer A is incorrect. The Act does not apply if the owner occupies a unit in a building with four or fewer units. This building has 10 units, and thus the exception does not apply. Answer B is incorrect. The fact that the tenant agreed to the \u201cno pets\u201d provision in the lease does not relieve the landlord from making a reasonable accommodation for the tenant\u2019s handicap. Answer C is incorrect. The landlord\u2019s refusal to permit the tenant to have a service dog may be arbitrary, but that is irrelevant because the Act requires the landlord to make a reasonable accommodation for the tenant\u2019s hearing impairment.",

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nAn owner acquired an apartment building and financed part of the purchase with a mortgage loan. The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC. Yes, because acceleration is required before a foreclosure action can be initiated.\nD.

While typically triggered by nonpayment of the mortgage debt, they can also be triggered by the mortgagor\u2019s failure to satisfy other conditions in the mortgage, such as timely payment of insurance premiums. Answer A is incorrect. Once acceleration has properly occurred, the consequences cannot be avoided because the owner attempts to pay the delinquent insurance premium. Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect. The desire to bring a foreclosure action does not create a right to accelerate a mortgage. Rather, the right to accelerate depends upon whether a term of a mortgage has been breached.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA developer financed the purchase of a tract of vacant land with a mortgage loan from the seller. Two years later, at a time when the land remained vacant, the developer took out a second mortgage loan from an investor to construct self-storage units on the land. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order in which they were executed. The developer made all payments on both mortgage loans for several years but eventually defaulted on the loan from the seller, who threatened to initiate foreclosure proceedings. To avoid the foreclosure, the developer executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure conveying the land back to the seller. But before the developer delivered the deed to the seller, it notified the investor of the proposed conveyance and gave her the option to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan. The investor declined to do so, and the developer delivered the deed to the seller. If nothing else has happened since the conveyance to the seller, is the investor\u2019s mortgage still valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the investor declined to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan.\nB. No, because the seller\u2019s mortgage was a purchase money mortgage.\nC. Yes, because a deed in lieu of foreclosure does not eliminate junior mortgages.\nD. Yes, because the investor\u2019s mortgage secures improvements made to vacant land.\nResponse:\n",

A mortgagor\u2019s later-executed mortgage generally can be extinguished only by foreclosure. Thus, the holder of the senior lien (the seller) should have searched the title to determine if a junior lien existed and, if so, brought a foreclosure action to extinguish it rather than accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Answer A is incorrect. The status of the investor, the junior lienholder, is not affected by that lienholder\u2019s failure to cure the mortgagor\u2019s default. Answer B is incorrect.

Before the closing, the buyer\u2019s attorney advised him to purchase a standard-form, $300,000 title insurance policy naming the buyer as the insured. Because the buyer had forgotten to bring his checkbook to the closing, his son, who had accompanied him to the closing, paid the premium for him. One year later, the buyer died. Under his will, the house passed to his son. Two years later, the son was successfully sued by a previous record owner with a superior title to the house. The previous owner\u2019s claim had not been excepted in the buyer\u2019s title insurance policy through the carelessness of a title company employee. At the time of the lawsuit, the house was still subject to the bank\u2019s mortgage. The son immediately sought indemnification for the loss from the title insurance company. Is the son entitled to indemnification from the title insurance company?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the son was not named as an insured on the title policy.\nB. No, because when a mortgage remains outstanding, a title policy protects only the mortgagee from any loss.\nC. Yes, because the house passed to the son under the buyer\u2019s will.\nD.

The man agreed, but because there was no way to site a home on the westerly portion of the land so that it was surrounded by two acres of vacant land, he applied to the local zoning board for a variance. Should the variance be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because hardship variances are not granted where the land is used for residential purposes.\nB.

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA man purchased two warehouses on the same parcel of land and financed the purchase with a mortgage loan from a bank. Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other.

This is because the deed was a conveyance of a life estate pur autre vie, which is a fee simple absolute interest in land. The son's quitclaim deed to the daughter was a conveyance of the remainder interest in the land. This is because the remainder was not alienable, as the father's will provided that the remainder interest would pass to the son. Thus, the purchaser owns the land, and the husband owns the remainder."

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by deed\u201d or \u201cafter-acquired property.\u201d Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple to the purchaser (the son\u2019s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired it from the son.      Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death. Answer C is incorrect. Here again, the daughter did not purport to convey a life estate to the purchaser and even if she had, it would have terminated at her death. Answer D is incorrect.

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire. Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is possible that a third party wrongfully let the cattle out of the pen.\nB. No, because the trucker must submit direct evidence of negligence in order to invoke the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.\nC.

While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect.

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA driver was injured when one of the tires on her car ruptured, causing the car to veer off the road. The rupture resulted from a defect in the tire that existed at the time it was sold by the manufacturer to a retailer, who sold it to the driver and installed it on her car. The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year. After discovering this memorandum, the driver\u2019s attorney filed a timely amended complaint, adding a claim for battery. The manufacturer has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the battery claim, based on the undisputed facts set out above. If no additional facts are provided to the court concerning the risk of tire rupture, should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care to prevent ruptures.\nB. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that consumers would be injured by tire ruptures.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The driver might have a valid strict products liability claim against the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support a finding\u2014required for battery liability\u2014that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA graduate student who was moving needed cardboard boxes, so she went to her usual grocery store to look for some. The store regularly gave repeat customers empty boxes to promote goodwill. Seeing no boxes outside, the student entered the store and asked a store employee for help. The employee pointed toward the rear of the store and said that all the empty boxes were in the storeroom. The student went into the storeroom through a door with a sign that said: \u201cKeep Out. Employees Only.\u201d While in the storeroom, she tripped on a fold in a floor mat and fell into a stack of wooden crates. The topmost crate fell on the student, causing a head injury. The student has sued the store to recover for her injury. Which statement below is the most appropriate characterization of the student and her conduct under traditional common law rules?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The student assumed the risk, because she knew that the storeroom was not normally accessible to the public.\nB. The student was a licensee in the store, because she had no intention of making a purchase at the store during the box-hunting visit.\nC. The student was a trespasser in the storeroom, because she ignored the sign on the door barring entrance to the storeroom.\nD. The student was an invitee in the storeroom, because she had permission to enter the storeroom consistent with the store\u2019s policy of making its empty boxes available to repeat customers.\nResponse:\n",

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA school bus driver reported to a middle school principal that a student had harassed other children on the bus. The principal informed the student\u2019s parents of the bus driver\u2019s report and told them that, because of the student\u2019s behavior, the student could not ride the bus for the next week and would have to be driven to school by a parent. The following Monday morning, after the bus driver had let the children off the bus in front of the school, but before she could close the door and drive away, the student\u2019s father pulled his car directly in front of her bus, blocking the driver\u2019s path. Because there was another bus right behind hers, the driver was unable to move her bus. The father got out of his car and strode toward the open door of the bus, screaming at the driver: \u201cYou messed with the wrong family! I am going to get you!\u201d Feeling threatened, the bus driver quickly closed the door. The father pounded on the door with enough force to dent it, screaming obscenities at the driver, until a school security guard intervened. If the driver were to sue the father, which cause of action would give her the best chance of recovery?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Assault.\nB. Battery.\nC. Intentional infliction of emotional distress.\nD. Trespass to chattels.\nResponse:\n",

            "explanation": "The father's threatening behavior, which was directed at the bus driver, clearly constitutes a battery. A battery is a harmful or offensive touching of another person. The father's behavior was threatening, and thus constitutes a battery. The bus driver could also claim assault. An assault is a threat of immediate harm or injury. The father's behavior, threatening to physically harm the bus driver, clearly constitutes an assault. The bus driver could also claim intentional infliction of emotional distress. Intentional infliction of emotional distress is a cause of action for extreme and outrageous behavior that causes severe emotional distress. The father's behavior was clearly outrageous, and it caused the bus driver to suffer severe emotional distress."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver. Even under the \u201cextended personality\u201d doctrine\u2014which, for example, allows a battery plaintiff to establish the necessary contact element if the defendant touches an article of clothing the plaintiff is wearing\u2014making contact with the bus is almost certain not to count as contacting the driver\u2019s person. Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect. The driver is not likely to be considered to have a possessory interest in the damaged bus, and therefore trespass to chattels would not be a viable claim.",

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA blasting company was conducting blasting operations in connection with a highway-widening project. Prior to setting off a charge, the blasting company supervisor posted a large warning sign and stationed a flagman to stop automobiles along the highway. Although a motorist saw and understood both the sign and the flagman\u2019s instruction to stop, the motorist nonetheless continued past the flagman and the sign and was traveling along the highway at the moment of the blast. A flying rock from the blast hit and severely damaged the motorist\u2019s car. The jurisdiction follows the traditional common law rules governing contributory negligence and assumption of risk. If the motorist pursues a claim against the blasting company to recover for the damage to the car, and all the foregoing facts are established, how much should the motorist recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The full value of the car.\nB. The full cost of restoring the car to its condition just before the accident.\nC.

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA trucking company employed nine salaried dispatchers to ensure that its truck fleet operated according to schedule. Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle. The supervisor told the dispatcher that he should quit if he couldn\u2019t handle the increased hours. Over the next three months, the dispatcher continued to complain about the working conditions, to no effect. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury. He eventually was hospitalized and had to miss several months of work as a result of the emotional distress. The dispatcher sued the trucking company for negligence. The company has moved for summary judgment, based on the undisputed facts set out above. Assume that there is no applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute. How should the court rule on the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny the motion, because the jury must determine the extent of the emotional distress suffered by the dispatcher.\nB.

Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty.

At the time the manufacturer entered into the contract, it had already firmly decided to withdraw from the State A market in two years. Because the distributor had heard rumors of such a plan, its chief executive officer, before signing the contract, asked a representative of the manufacturer whether such a plan was in place.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

Chosen Option Label: (The letter corresponding to the correct answer choice)\n\nExample 1: \nQuestion:\n A neighbor frequently visited a woman who lived in the house next to him. The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA dairy farmer bought a milking system for his cows from an independent distributor. The farmer did not communicate with the manufacturer of the milking system or any of its agents before purchasing the system. The distributor knew that the farmer had several lucrative contracts with milk wholesalers, but the manufacturer was unaware of these contracts. The system never operated properly because of a manufacturing defect, and as a result the dairy farmer lost much of the wholesale contract revenue. Does the farmer have a viable strict products liability claim against the manufacturer for recovery of his lost revenue?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because of the economic loss doctrine.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was not aware of the farmer\u2019s wholesale contracts.\nC. Yes, because the consequential damages rule of contract law does not apply in a products liability action in which the product was in fact defective.\nD. Yes, because the milking system\u2019s defect proximately caused the farmer\u2019s loss of revenue.\nResponse:\n",

The manufacturer was not aware of the contracts, and thus, the economic loss doctrine does not apply. The manufacturer's liability for the defective product is not limited by the contracts between the farmer and the milk wholesalers, and thus, the manufacturer can be held liable for the farmer's loss of revenue."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. In this case, the only harm suffered by the farmer was lost revenue, and strict products liability does not apply when a defective product causes only economic loss, as opposed to personal injury or property damage. Answer B is incorrect. The problem is not the manufacturer\u2019s lack of knowledge about the farmer\u2019s contracts but the rule that prevents an injured party from recovering for purely economic loss caused by a defective product. Answer C is incorrect. The statement is true, but it does not entitle the farmer to damages. The contract law rule of consequential damages is irrelevant to the resolution of a tort claim. Answer D is incorrect. Because the farmer has suffered only economic loss, he cannot recover on a strict products liability theory.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A rule of products liability law states that there is no recovery if a defect in a product causes damage only to the product itself (as opposed to personal injury, or injury to other property). This rule is sometimes referred to as the \u201ceconomic loss rule.\u201d In such cases, the owner of the damaged product is limited to contract remedies. Answer B is incorrect. The absence of negligence on the part of the manufacturer does not provide a basis for denying recovery to the couple on a strict products liability claim. Answer C is incorrect. Recovery on a strict products liability claim does not depend on whether the evidence supports an inference of manufacturer negligence.

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nA racetrack held a motorcycle race, which was sponsored by a local motorcycle dealership. Under the sponsorship agreement, the dealership was required to arrange for licensed and trained emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to be present during the race. The dealership contracted with a licensed and reputable emergency medical services (EMS) firm that supplied EMTs for events such as these. A motorcyclist participating in the race was injured when he lost control of his motorcycle. The motorcyclist was treated at the scene by the EMTs. In removing the motorcyclist\u2019s helmet, one of the EMTs twisted the motorcyclist\u2019s neck, causing him to become permanently paralyzed. The motorcyclist has sued both the EMS firm and the dealership, alleging that the EMT\u2019s careless conduct caused his paralysis. Assuming the validity of the motorcyclist\u2019s negligence claim against the EMS firm, which of the following best characterizes the dealership\u2019s potential liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The dealership is directly liable for hiring the EMS firm.\nB. The dealership is vicariously liable, because it owed a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care for the race.\nC. The dealership is vicariously liable, because the EMT was careless in the course of her employment.\nD. The dealership is neither directly liable nor vicariously liable.\nResponse:\n",

            "explanation": "The dealership's liability is based on vicarious liability for the negligence of the EMT. The dealership is vicariously liable for the negligence of the EMT because the dealership hired the EMT and had the right to control the EMT's conduct. The dealership is not directly liable for the negligence of the EMT because the dealership did not hire the EMT and did not have the right to control the EMT's conduct. The dealership's liability is not based on negligent supervision or retention, because the dealership did not supervise or retain the EMT."

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. Because the dealership\u2019s duty of care was delegable, because the dealership was not negligent in hiring the EMS firm, and because the EMT was not an employee of the dealership, there is no basis for holding the dealership liable, whether directly or vicariously. Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is also no basis for direct liability. Answer B is incorrect. The duty to provide competent medical care was properly delegated to the EMS firm. Answer C is incorrect. Because the EMT was an employee only of the EMS firm, not the dealership, any carelessness by the EMT could be imputed only to the EMS firm.",
