Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": " The government may only take private property for public use, with just compensation. Here, the law merely effects a change in the way that oil and gas interests are transferred from one owner to another. This is a property transfer tax or device, which, like other taxes or devices, will only pass muster if it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. In this case, the state's interest in encouraging resource extraction is rational, and the classification of these interests as transfers at death is rationally related to that interest. Therefore, Answer D is correct. Answer A is incorrect because this is not a taking of property. Answer B is incorrect because this does not unduly burden interstate commerce. Answer C is incorrect because this is not a privilege created by state law, but rather a property right. There is no classification here for which class-based license, permit, or privilege would apply."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The federal amendment to the bankruptcy statute is known as the \"Savings Clause\" and it provides that \"the laws of the various states shall continue in force except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.\" The purpose of the Savings Clause is to ensure that bankruptcy law in the United States is not a uniform, federal common law. Rather, bankruptcy law is to be interpreted and applied according to state law. Therefore, because the state statute at issue in this question is a part of the \"laws of the various states,\" it is not inconsistent with the federal statute and is, in fact, required by the Savings Clause. A is incorrect. Here, the man's injury was caused by negligence, not by the transportation of goods in interstate commerce. Therefore, the man's claim is not within the scope of the commerce clause. C is incorrect. The federal statute does not implicate the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. D is a misstatement of the law. The rational basis test applies to all statutes that implicate fundamental rights. Here, the man's home is protected from execution by his debts by the Savings Clause. The length of time the man has lived in the state is irrelevant to whether his home is exempt, and the two-year requirement is rationally related to the legitimate state interest in preventing fraud.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss.

That injury is not such that it can reasonably be expected to recur. B is incorrect because the city's voluntary change in policy does not relieve the plaintiff of the burden of showing that the original policy was unconstitutional. C is correct. The city's general policy of changing meters without notice is still in effect and the plaintiff still has a stake in the outcome. Therefore, the case is not moot and the court should not grant the city's motion to dismiss. D is incorrect because the plaintiff's claim is not inappropriate for judicial resolution because the underlying facts are not sufficiently mature, the issues are not fully developed, and the balance of hardships does not tip in the city's favor. Here, the underlying facts are the plaintiff's obstructed efforts to prevent the removal of his meter, and the city's threat of prosecution. The issues are fully developed because the plaintiff has alleged that the city's policy of replacing meters without notice infringes upon his freedom of expression, and that the city's threat of arrest for obstructing the meter change violates his freedom of association. The balance of hardships does not tip in the city's favor because the plaintiff has a constitutional right at stake, and the harm to the city from a delay in resolution of the case is minimal because the city's policy of replacing meters without notice is still in effect.

Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest.

The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development.

Malice can, however, be implied in the commission of certain intentional crimes (malice aforethought can also be expressed). Here, the man intentionally killed the police officer, while trying to kill his neighbor. The officer was killed in the attempt to kill the neighbor, so the man is guilty of capital murder under common law, which is defined at common law as the intentional killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Answer B is incorrect. Premeditation is not a necessary element of capital murder. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is the victim here, and the victim cannot be the object of the murder. Answer D is incorrect. This is not a case of attempted murder. The man already killed the officer before he missed his shot at his neighbor. The man is properly convicted of capital murder."

Answer B is incorrect because the officer did not need to, and did not, use any amount of force on the parolee to question him.

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v.

However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A.

Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data.

The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder.

The problem is not that the prosecutor would be enhancing the charges; it is that the jury has already acquitted the defendant of the primary count. Answer C is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s request for the instruction on the lesser included offense does not operate to nullify the jury\u2019s implied not-guilty verdict on the greater offense. Answer D is incorrect because, by convicting the defendant only on the lesser count, the jury impliedly acquitted on the greater count.",

Three witnesses testified for the state that the defendant approached the victim in a bar, engaged in a brief conversation with him, and then, without warning, drew a gun and shot the victim in the stomach. One witness for the state testified that just before the defendant drew his gun and shot the victim, the victim twice kicked the defendant in the groin. The state\u2019s evidence clearly established that the victim died as a result of the gunshot wound. The defendant did not testify or offer any evidence. The defendant requested that the jury be instructed on voluntary manslaughter based upon heat of passion from adequate provocation. The state argued that murder should be the only form of homicide submitted. Should the court instruct on voluntary manslaughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant did not meet his burden of producing evidence of heat of passion from adequate provocation.\nB. No, because the weight of the evidence indicated that the victim did nothing amounting to adequate provocation.\nC.

Answer A is incorrect because the defendant does not bear the burden of producing evidence of heat of passion from adequate provocation. The defendant is not required to put on any evidence whatsoever.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct because a reasonable jury could find that the defendant was twice kicked in the groin by the victim prior to the homicide, and on that basis could conclude that the defendant had adequate provocation. Even      though it is a single witness who recounts this event, a jury can credit a single witness\u2019s testimony. Answer A is incorrect because the state offered evidence of a serious battery on the defendant, which can constitute an adequate provocation, no matter which party presented the evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the judge\u2019s job is not to weigh the evidence but is only to determine whether a reasonable jury could find adequate provocation. The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis. For instance, if there were no evidence of provocation, but the defense sought a manslaughter instruction, such an instruction should be denied.",

After trial, defense counsel learned that the prosecution had failed to disclose that the key witness against the defendant had previously been convicted of perjury in another case. The defense filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court rejected the defense argument and upheld the conviction because state discovery rules did not require the disclosure. The defendant then filed an appeal, arguing that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose this prior perjury conviction had violated his federal constitutional rights. Can the state appellate court overturn the conviction based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the witness\u2019s prior perjury conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery is regulated by state rather than federal procedure.\nB. No, because the prior conviction was mere impeachment rather than evidence of actual innocence.\nC.

Under those standards, a conviction may be overturned on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct if the defendant can show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the misconduct, the result of the trial would have been different. Here, the defense attorney was prevented from making the best case he could for the defendant because he was not aware of the witness's prior perjury conviction. Without this information, he was unable to impeach the key witness or cross-examine him effectively. Therefore, the defendant has shown that he was prejudiced by the prosecution's failure to disclose this information and is entitled to a new trial. Answer A is incorrect. This is a federal question case and the state's failure to disclose evidence to the defendant is a federal constitutional violation. Answer B is incorrect. The witness's prior perjury conviction is not a mere impeachment device. Its relevance here goes to the witness's character for truthfulness, which is a proper area for inquiry. Answer D is incorrect. The defendant is not entitled to a new trial simply because he was prejudiced by the prosecution's misconduct. The defendant must also show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the misconduct, the result of the trial would have been different."

Answer A is incorrect because, although generally discovery is governed by state rules, the due process clause contains some core rights, such as the right to disclosure of critical exculpatory evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the scope of due process is not limited to proof of actual innocence.

If a defendant does not raise the issue at trial, the issue is said to be waived. However, a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights is not waived simply by failing to object. A defendant's constitutional rights are waived if the defendant either knows of the violation and fails to object, or if the violation affects the fairness of the trial in such a way that the defendant could not reasonably be expected to know of the violation and object. B is incorrect. A defendant can not be found guilty of a criminal offense if the evidence against him is obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights. If the defendant's new counsel can show that the evidence was obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. C is incorrect.

The owner's obligation to the arborist is a contract debt, which can be satisfied in one of two ways: by returning the owner to the position she would have been in had the contract not been made (expectation interest), or by restoring the other party to the position he would have been in had the contract been fully performed (restitutionary interest). Here, the owner's obligation to the arborist is a contract debt. The arborist's expectation interest is $10,000 less any costs the arborist avoided by not completing his performance. It is important to note that the arborist's expectation interest is measured by what the parties contracted for, not what the arborist deserved. In this case, the arborist's expectation interest is $10,000, the amount the owner agreed to pay for the work. The arborist's restitutionary interest, on the other hand, is the reasonable value of the services the arborist rendered. It is within the owner's power to avoid paying this debt because the fire was due to vandalism, which frustrated the purpose of the contract. The owner is not required to pay the arborist just because the fire occurred. The arborist failed to complete the job, so his expectation interest is zero. Therefore, the arborist's recovery is limited to his restitutionary interest, which is the reasonable value of the services rendered. Answer B is incorrect because the arborist's recovery is limited to his restitutionary interest, which is the reasonable value of the services rendered. Answer C is incorrect because the owner is not required to pay the arborist just because the fire occurred. The arborist failed to complete the job, so his expectation interest is zero.

Answer D is incorrect because the owner is not required to pay the arborist just because the fire occurred. The arborist failed to complete the job, so his expectation interest is zero.

Evidence of course can be admitted to interpret a writing. However when the evidence is of a statement that should have been in the writing but was not, the bar of the rule may apply. In this case, the evidence is of an oral agreement between the general contractor and subcontractor to reduce the price of the cement foundation to $15,000. Because the evidence is of a statement that should have been in the writing but was not, the bar of the rule may apply. Here, however, the bar of the rule does not apply because the evidence is being admitted to interpret the writing (the general contract). Interpretation of a writing can only be done by reference to the terms of the writing itself. Therefore, the $15,000 modification is a valid interpretation of the general contract. Thus, the subcontractor is likely to recover $15,000, the amount of the modification."

The buyer refused and told the seller that she would purchase lumber elsewhere.

Thus, the seller will not be liable to the buyer for breach of contract and the buyer will not recover any damages. Answer A is incorrect. The buyer's damages here are the amount of money the buyer would have saved by purchasing the lumber from the other supplier. The buyer could have obtained the lumber from the seller for $14,500, so its availability to the buyer under the contract was $14,500 - $3,000, or $11,500. The buyer, however, did not seek to recover the $3,000 the seller demanded; rather, the buyer refused to pay the full contract price of $12,500. Therefore, the buyer's damages will be $11,500 - $2,000, or $9,500. Answer B is incorrect. Under the facts of this question, the buyer is entitled to contract damages only. The seller\u2019s request for an increase in the purchase price is not a termination or a default under the contract, and thus the buyer is not entitled to recover damages based on the seller\u2019s failure to mitigate. Answer C is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s obligation to pay the full purchase price when the market price of lumber was $12,500 was a reasonable exclusion of liability for market forces beyond the seller's control. The buyer's obligation to pay the full purchase price was not a termination or a default under the contract, and thus the buyer is not entitled to recover damages based on the seller\u2019s failure to mitigate. Answer D is correct. As stated above, the seller\u2019s request for an increase in the purchase price is not a termination or a default under the contract. Because the buyer did not breach the contract by refusing to pay the full purchase price, the seller's obligation to deliver was not breached and the buyer has not suffered any damages.

            "explanation": " Because the contract is a divisible contract, the contractor is entitled to recover only the amount of money that was still owed to him when he breached the contract. Here, $60,000 was owed to the contractor when he quit, so he is entitled to be paid that amount. Answer A is incorrect. Although the contractor may be entitled to some money due to his reliance, the amount is limited to the amount already owed to him when he breached the contract. Here, that amount is $60,000. Answer C is incorrect. Restitution is only available to the extent the party seeking it has been changed by the transaction at issue. The man, not the contractor, was the one who benefited from the contractor's performance of the work, so the contractor is not entitled to restitution. Answer D is incorrect. The contractor's breach is not a justification for the man to withhold payment. The man is still obligated to pay the $60,000 due under the contract."

A party that materially breaches a contract is nevertheless entitled to recover under a theory of restitution the amount of the value of the benefit that the breaching party\u2019s part performance conferred on the victim of the breach. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374. Answer A is incorrect. A breaching party cannot recover on a theory of reliance. Answer B is incorrect. This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 240. Answer D is incorrect. Contract law generally does not distinguish between willful breaches and other breaches. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374; Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 12.3. This situation would not require a court to consider the reason for breach.",

If a buyer repudiates a contract for unfinished goods, the seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment proceed in any reasonable manner, including finishing the goods for resale. UCC \u00a7 2- 704(2). The seller\u2019s damages in that situation are the difference between the contract price and the resale price. UCC \u00a7 2- 706(1). Here that amount is $8,000. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale. Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale rather than seeking costs and lost profit.

            "explanation": " This question requires you to distinguish between two possible sources of law for a factual situation. The issue is whether a counselor from an employee assistance program may testify about a defendant's privileged communications with the counselor. The plaintiff seeks to have the counselor testify in a diversity action in federal court. You can determine the applicable law by considering the following facts and answer choices. The diversity action is pending in a state that recognizes the doctor-patient privilege. The relevant law of the state is that a patient may not be required to disclose to his or her physician any fact or opinion which he or she reasonably believes to be confidential. The communications at issue here are privileged under that law. The question is whether the counselor can testify about the defendant's communications with the counselor. The answer is that the federal court will apply federal law, because this is a diversity action. The federal Rules of Evidence do not directly address this issue, so you must look to federal common law. The analysis of this issue requires the court to consider the policy behind the privilege, the nature of the proceeding, and the need for accuracy in factfinding. After considering these factors, the court will determine that the defendant cannot compel the counselor to testify, because doing so would violate the patient's privilege. Thus, answer A is correct. You can see that this is a tricky question because it requires you to distinguish between two possible sources of law. You will find that many questions like this one can be broken down into two parts: 1) determine the applicable law, and 2) apply that law to the facts. Once you know what law to apply, you can then easily identify the correct answer. This process will allow you to efficiently and effectively answer questions like this one."

The ledger includes detailed information regarding the defendant\u2019s purchases and sales of drugs over a two-year period. The prosecutor is considering two alternative ways to lay the foundation for admission of the ledger as a business record.

The second alternative is to call a codefendant, who has pled guilty, to testify that he was the defendant\u2019s drug supplier for over two years and that he was present when the defendant used the ledger to record their transactions as well as transactions with other buyers and sellers as they occurred. Which of the following is correct regarding the ledger\u2019s admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ledger may be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant.\nB. The ledger may be admitted through the codefendant but not through the officer.\nC.

The prosecutor could introduce the ledger through the codefendant, who created the record and has personal knowledge of its contents.

Answer A is incorrect because the prosecutor could call the codefendant but not the officer to authenticate the ledger. The business records exception does not mandate that the witness be a records custodian. Answer C is incorrect because the ledger can be authenticated through the codefendant's testimony. Answer D is incorrect because the illicit nature of the transactions does not automatically exclude the record. The admissibility of a record under the business records exception turns on whether the record was properly maintained and can be authenticated. Here, the codefendant created the record, has personal knowledge of its contents, and can properly authenticate it.

By ordering the plaintiff to testify first, the judge has in effect created a situation in which the defendant will not be able to receive a fair trial. The judge has thus exceeded her authority and should instead permit the plaintiff to testify last. A is incorrect. This is not a matter of discretion for the judge. The plaintiff is entitled to put on his own case, and he is not required to testify. B is incorrect. This is a requirement of the Federal Rules of Evidence, not a matter of judicial discretion. C is incorrect. Although a party is entitled to control the order in which it presents evidence, that entitlement does not mean that a party may completely dictate the order of proof.

The public records exception does not apply to statements; it applies only to documents. As such, the neighbor cannot object to the report on the basis that it contains hearsay.

Answer A is incorrect because it suggests that the judge should exclude the report, when in fact the neighbor is the one who gets to make this decision. Answer C is incorrect because the neighbor does not have a constitutional right to confront witnesses against him at trial. This is a common law right that is limited to situations involving excluded testimony. Here, the report is a public record, so the neighbor does not get to make this choice. Answer D is incorrect because the statement from the witness is not hearsay. The witness is testifying for the fire marshal, a governmental agency. Therefore, the statement is non-hearsay. It is also notable that the witness is described as a \"person\" who made the statement.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The routine practice of the company\u2019s agents in discussing supplemental policy options with customers is admissible under FRE 406. Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury. Answer B is incorrect. To constitute habit evidence, an organization\u2019s practice need not be \u201cautomatic\u201d but only routine\u2014something that is regularly done. The supervisor\u2019s testimony here is that the agents\u2019 regular practice is to discuss supplemental policy options with customers. Answer C is incorrect. Character evidence is not admissible in civil cases to prove conduct. See FRE 404(a) and (b). This evidence is admissible only if it is habit evidence\u2014evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice\u2014under FRE 406.",

One trial witness was a child who had seen one of the killings. Before calling the child to testify, the prosecution moved to remove the defendant from the courtroom, arguing that the child would be intimidated by seeing the defendant. The court denied the motion. When the child entered the courtroom to testify, the defendant became unruly, moving as though he was about to lunge from his chair toward the child. The judge warned the defendant to stop the behavior. After a second warning, the judge told the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to behave inappropriately. The defendant then shouted a threat at the child. At that point, the court ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom. When the child finished testifying, subject to full cross-examination by defense counsel, the defendant was allowed back into the courtroom. The trial concluded, and the jury convicted the defendant. The defendant appealed the conviction, challenging only his exclusion from the courtroom. Should the court of appeals reverse the conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a defendant may be excluded from the courtroom to protect a minor witness from further trauma.\nB. No, because the right to be present can be forfeited by disruptive behavior.\nC. Yes, because the error requires automatic reversal.\nD. Yes, unless the error in excluding the defendant was harmless.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

This is an automatic reversal. There is an exception to the constitutional right to be present, however: when a defendant's presence in the courtroom would constitute a disturbance. In this case, however, the defendant was not a disturbance when he was in the courtroom. He was only disruptive when the child witness testified, and his disruption was a response to the defendant's legitimate concern for the child's welfare. Thus, answer D is correct. Answer A is incorrect. The defendant's removal was not justified by any of the reasons for excluding a defendant from the courtroom. Answer B is incorrect. The defendant's removal was not triggered by any of the circumstances in which a defendant's presence may be forfeited. Answer C is incorrect. This is an automatic reversal. The judge's error is clear and does not depend on any factual determination. There is no need to consider whether the error was harmless. If the issue was whether the defendant should have been removed from the courtroom, the answer is no. The judge should not have ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom. If the issue was whether the defendant's conviction should be reversed, the answer is yes."

The company\u2019s president told the attorney that the manager had begun working for a competitor and gave the attorney a copy of the signed covenant. The attorney brought a federal diversity action against the manager and attached to the complaint a copy of the signed covenant. The attorney also moved for a preliminary injunction, referring to the attached covenant and submitting a supporting affidavit from the company\u2019s president. At the hearing on the preliminary injunction motion, the manager denied ever having signed such a covenant and conclusively demonstrated that the copy of a signed covenant attached to the company\u2019s motion was forged. The court, on its own initiative, ordered the attorney to show cause why the attorney should not be sanctioned under Rule 11. Would sanctions against the attorney be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the court did not give the attorney notice and 21 days to withdraw the preliminary injunction motion.\nB. No, because the motion was supported by evidence that was likely sufficient to satisfy an objectively reasonable attorney.\nC. Yes, because the attorney filed papers with the court that contained untrue assertions of fact.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) requires that factual contentions presented by an attorney to the court have evidentiary support. Attorneys may rely on affidavits and documents provided by their clients unless the circumstances suggest that it would be unreasonable to do so or that further inquiry is needed. Answer A is incorrect. The \u201csafe harbor\u201d requirement in Rule 11 applies only when a party moves for sanctions, not when the court acts on its own initiative. Answer C is incorrect. Under Rule 11(b), attorneys certify that factual contentions they present to the court have evidentiary support, not that they are true. As indicated above, there is nothing in the facts suggesting that the attorney should have questioned either the signed covenant or the president\u2019s affidavit as containing false information. Answer D is incorrect. There is no general rule requiring attorneys to verify signatures on documents before presenting them to a court. Rather, the inquiry under Rule 11(b) is whether the attorney acted to the best of the attorney\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry under the circumstances. Here, there are no facts given that suggest that it would have been unreasonable for the attorney to assume that the signature on the covenant was valid.",

The complaint alleged breach of contract claims arising from construction delays and deficient electrical work that had caused the corporation significant financial losses. The general contractor filed a crossclaim against the subcontractor, asserting only the defense that the general contractor was not liable to the corporation because the subcontractor\u2019s deficient work was the sole cause of the construction delays and the corporation\u2019s losses. After discovery, the corporation settled with the general contractor and dismissed the claims against it. The subcontractor has moved to dismiss the general contractor\u2019s crossclaim. Which of the following arguments best supports the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The crossclaim is improper, because it asserts a defense, not a claim for relief.\nB. The crossclaim is improper, because the general contractor and the subcontractor are opposing parties, not co-parties.\nC. The crossclaim is invalid, because the general contractor is no longer a party to the underlying action.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. Although the crossclaim is initially filed after the commencement of the action, it does not allege a new claim for relief. It is a claim against the general contractor for breach of contract. B is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not use the terms \"co-party\" or \"counter-party.\" Here, the subcontractor is a necessary party to the general contractor's crossclaim because the subcontractor is the only party that could possibly have breached the construction contract. If the general contractor's claim is to be valid, it must be supported by evidence that the subcontractor breached the contract. Thus, the subcontractor is a necessary party to the crossclaim and cannot be considered an adverse party. Therefore, the general contractor and the subcontractor cannot be considered co-parties. C is incorrect. The general contractor is still a party to the underlying action because it has not been dismissed from that action. The general contractor's obligation to the corporation is measured by its performance under the construction contract. If the general contractor breached the contract, the subcontractor may also be responsible for some of the corporation's damages. Therefore, the subcontractor is an essential party to the general contractor's crossclaim. D is correct. Although the subcontract was not a party to the initial complaint, it has been added as a necessary party to the general contractor's crossclaim. Because the crossclaim is dependent upon the general contractor's performance under the construction contract, the claim is contingent on the corporation's underlying action. The general contractor's crossclaim is therefore precluded until the underlying action is resolved."

There is no authority under Rule 13(g) to allow an attempt to assert a defense against the plaintiff so as to shift direct liability for damages owed to the plaintiff to a codefendant. Answer B is incorrect. The general contractor and the subcontractor were both joined by the corporation as defendants.      That makes them codefendants under Rule 13(g). Answer C is incorrect. Even if the corporation\u2019s claim against the general contractor has been dismissed, as long as the crossclaim remains undetermined, the general contractor and the subcontractor remain in the suit for purposes of that claim.

Rule 13(g) specifically provides that a crossclaim may include a claim that the co-party is or \u201cmay be\u201d liable for all or part of the claim asserted in the main action.

Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment.

In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial.

The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect.

Even if the employees' federal-law and state-law claims were completely substituted for one another, the district court would still have to consider the justifications for delaying an appeal. C is incorrect. There is no constitutional or statutory right to an immediate appeal. The district court is not required to grant a motion for an immediate appeal, and delaying an appeal may not actually prejudice the employees. D is correct. The employees are entitled to an immediate appeal of the summary judgment order on their federal-law claims because there is no justifiable reason to delay. The federal-law claims are separate from the state-law claims, and the summary judgment order on the federal-law claims is immediately appealable. Here, there is no unresolved claim from the complaint, the district court has already considered the merits of the federal-law claims, and the district court's ruling on the summary judgment motion raises a substantial, arguable constitutional question. Thus, the employees are entitled to an immediate interlocutory appeal."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. There is no final judgment if a party has the right to a further appeal. In this case, the scientist has a right to a further appeal, so the judgment is not final. B is incorrect. There is federal question jurisdiction when the federal court has diversity jurisdiction and the state law claim raises a substantial federal question. In this case, the federal court has diversity jurisdiction and the scientist is asserting a claim under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, so the state law claim presents a substantial federal question and the court has federal question jurisdiction. C is incorrect. Interlocutory appeals are discretionary, and the court in this case did not indicate that it was taking the appeal. Therefore, the court will not take the interlocutory appeal. D is correct. The judgment is not a final judgment, so the scientist cannot appeal it.

As the state-law claim remains to be decided in the action, there is not yet a final judgment on the merits of the entire action, and thus an appeal is not allowed under the final judgment rule. Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Answer C is incorrect. To obtain a discretionary interlocutory appeal, the party seeking to appeal must apply to both the district and appellate courts to meet the statutory standards. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Because the scientist has appealed without attempting to satisfy that requirement, the appeal cannot be treated as a discretionary interlocutory appeal. Answer D is incorrect. Under the final judgment rule, a judgment is not final until all the claims in the action have been resolved. While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

A court will enforce an \u201cas is\u201d clause in residential sales as long as there is no positive misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment, neither of which is present in these facts. Answer B is incorrect. A warranty deed provides protection for title issues, not issues of physical condition. Answer D is incorrect. The merger doctrine is irrelevant. Under that doctrine, acceptance of the warranty deed extinguishes all contractual promises of the seller relating to the quality of title. Here, the suit is about the condition of the residence, not its title. The \u201cas is\u201d clause extinguishes claims based upon termites, as that clause eliminates any contractual duty of the seller to deliver a residence free of termites.",

The Fair Housing Act requires that a landlord make reasonable accommodations to the disability of a prospective or current tenant. This means that if a landlord has a policy that is not necessary for the operation of the business and the policy would deny the disabled person the opportunity to use and enjoy the rental unit, the landlord may be required to make an exception to the policy and permit the tenant to keep the service animal. Here, the landlord's no-pet policy is likely to violate the Fair Housing Act because it will deny the hearing-impaired tenant the opportunity to use and enjoy her apartment. Answer A is incorrect because the fact that the landlord lives in an apartment in the building is irrelevant to whether her refusal to make an exception to the no-pet policy is discriminatory. Answer B is incorrect because the tenant does not have to agree to a no-pet policy to use her apartment. Answer D is incorrect because the tenant does not need a reasonable accommodation.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC.

The owner\u2019s failure to maintain the insurance for 10 days after notice from the lender caused a default under the terms of the mortgage. The lender did not waive its right to accelerate by accepting the delinquent insurance payment. Doing so would have amounted to a waiver of the right to accelerate, which the lender did not intend to do. Likewise, the reinstatement of the insurance policy by the insurer does not relieve the owner of its obligation to the lender.

Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect.

Although the bank\u2019s mortgage was still in place, it was a \"lien\" policy, which only protects the bank (as the mortgagee) against loss due to title defects. The buyer\u2019s title insurance policy, by contrast, is an \"ownership\" policy, which protects the buyer (and his heirs) against such losses. The buyer\u2019s son is entitled to indemnification from the title insurance company for the loss suffered by the previous owner, because the unpaid premium was a breach of the insurance contract which caused a failure to pay a premium due. The bank, as mortgagee, is also entitled to indemnification for the loss it suffered as a result of the buyer\u2019s failure to reimburse it for the amount of the mortgage. The bank, however, is not the insured on the policy; the insured was the buyer. The buyer\u2019s son, as the insured, is entitled to the proceeds of the claim, regardless of whether he actually paid the premium. Although the bank may also recover, it is entitled to only those proceeds that reflect the value of its interest in the property (the amount of the mortgage). Because the previous owner\u2019s claim was not excepted, the bank is not entitled to any of the proceeds that represent the value of the buyer\u2019s interest (the full purchase price of the house). As such, the bank\u2019s recovery will be limited to the amount of its mortgage (the $250,000 debt), and the full value of the property (the $300,000) will pass to the buyer\u2019s son."

His daughter offered to take care of him for the rest of his life if he would build her a small home on the westerly portion of his land. The man agreed, but because there was no way to site a home on the westerly portion of the land so that it was surrounded by two acres of vacant land, he applied to the local zoning board for a variance. Should the variance be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because hardship variances are not granted where the land is used for residential purposes.\nB.

            "explanation": " This question requires you to distinguish between a hardship and a variance. A hardship is an impairment of some sort, whether physical, mental, or emotional, that makes it difficult for a person to care for himself or herself. A variance, on the other hand, is a departure from a zoning ordinance that makes a particular use of a structure more appropriate for a given area than a strict adherence to the ordinance would permit. Variances are discretionary, and a local government may grant them only when it finds that strict adherence to the ordinance would impose a practical difficulty on the owner of the property. In this case, the man's situation represents a hardship, and his daughter's situation would also represent a hardship. Because there is a privity (common) interest between the man and his daughter, the daughter is considered the \"owner\" of the property for purposes of seeking a variance. Although the man's land is restricted to residential use, the use of the westerly portion of the land for the daughter's home would be consistent with the original covenant, and a hardship variance is normally granted when the proposed use is consistent with a covenant in a warranty deed.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business.

The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it.

            "explanation": " This question requires you to distinguish between a life estate and a remainder. A life estate is a right to use and possess a property for the life of the holder of the estate. A remainder is the interest in a property that is left to a party after the life estate holder has used the property for his/her life. A life estate can be created by a transfer during the grantor's life and can also be created by a conveyance in a will. A life estate can also be created by a transfer \"for life\" (pur autre vie). A life estate can be conveyed by a deed, will, or by operation of law (e.g., when a child is named as the beneficiary of a trust for life). A remainder, on the other hand, can only be created by a transfer in a will. When a life estate is created, it is created for the benefit of a named individual (the life tenant). A life estate cannot be transferred to another person. However, when a remainder is created, it can be transferred to another person (the remainderman). A remainder is a transferable interest. Therefore, answer C is correct. The purchaser of the land received a life estate, and the husband (as the son's executor) holds the remainder. The purchaser received a life estate because the deed from the daughter conveyed the land to the purchaser for the purchaser's life, \"free from any mortgage.\" The language \"free from any mortgage\" creates the life estate for the purchaser. The fact that the deed was properly recorded will not affect the nature of the interest held by the purchaser. The fact that the son later transferred his interest to the daughter is irrelevant. The son's interest was a life estate, which cannot be transferred. Thus, the purchaser's interest is a life estate, and the husband's interest is the remainder. A, B and D are incorrect."

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter.

Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee.

The manufacturer is not strictly liable for all harms that its product may cause; the manufacturer is only strictly liable for those harms that the product could have reasonably been expected to cause. The plaintiff's battery claim, however, is based on the defendant's allegedly negligent placement of the tire in the stream of commerce, so the battery claim would fail if the plaintiff is unable to establish that the tire could have reasonably been expected to rupture. Thus, the battery claim is inconsistent with the strict products liability claim, and the manufacturer is entitled to partial summary judgment on this claim. B is incorrect. Even if the evidence were to show that the tire was defective, the plaintiff would still need to prove that the manufacturer had actual knowledge of the danger and that the danger was such that it would be apparent to a reasonable manufacturer. It is impossible to know with absolute certainty what a reasonable manufacturer would have done under these facts; accordingly, the manufacturer's motion for partial summary judgment should be denied on this claim. C is incorrect. A claim for strict products liability is a legal claim; it is entirely separate from any negligence claim the plaintiff may have. Thus, the fact that the manufacturer could not have been negligent with respect to the strict products liability claim would not, on its own, support a battery claim. D is incorrect. The plaintiff does not need to prove the manufacturer had the intent to cause harm; the manufacturer is strictly liable for all foreseeable harms caused by its product, whether the defendant knew about the harm or not. The question is whether the harm could reasonably be foreseen.

A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a finished product by the product\u2019s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the component is what rendered the finished product defective. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 5 (1998). In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer A is incorrect. The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met). Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer D is incorrect. The mere knowledge that the sand needed to be properly mixed with water and cement to make sound concrete is not sufficient to render the distributor liable for an injury caused by the defective concrete.",

The woman may sue the company for the security officer's tortious acts, and the case should be decided by a jury. Answer A is incorrect. It is irrelevant to the woman's claims whether the company authorized the security officer's acts. Answer B is incorrect. The woman's alleged breach of contract is completely unrelated to the tortious acts of the security officer, and the company cannot use the woman's breach of contract as a defense to the woman's tort claims. Moreover, even if the woman had breached her contract, the company would not be privileged to commit the related tort. Answer D is incorrect. The woman's claims are against the company, not the security officer, so the woman is entitled to a jury trial on those claims. The company, however, may move for a directed verdict on the security officer's behalf. If the company does so, the judge should determine whether the woman has shown sufficient evidence to support an inference that the security officer was the one who obtained her records.

Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the company did not expressly authorize the security officer\u2019s specific actions does not necessarily allow it to avoid liability.

Therefore, B is correct. The other causes of action are not as well suited to the facts of this case. A is incorrect.

Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous.

The packaging indicated that the pills were \u201ccoated\u201d but did not list the ingredients in the coating. A few days after she bought the medication, because the daughter was in extreme pain, the mother gave the daughter three times the recommended dose of the medication.

            "explanation": " The manufacturer has a duty to warn of the foreseeable, hidden dangers of its products. The danger here was foreseeable because the mother knew about the daughter's allergy, and the harm was hidden because the mother did not know what was in the coating. The manufacturer has a duty to warn of these types of foreseeable, hidden dangers to its product, irrespective of whether the ultimate user is the buyer or a bystander. Here, the manufacturer had a duty to warn the mother, not the daughter. Answer A is incorrect because it is impossible to determine how rare the daughter's allergy is. This is because it is impossible to determine the probability of harm when the harm is a pure remote, or legal, cause. The manufacturer does not have a duty to warn of remote harms unless the severity of the harm and the plausibility of the cause of harm are such that the danger is foreseeable. Here, the manufacturer's duty is to the mother, so it is the mother's knowledge of the daughter's allergy that determines the severity of the harm and whether the danger is foreseeable. Thus, it cannot be said that the allergy is remote. Answer C is incorrect because it is impossible to determine whether the mother\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of harm when the issue is the manufacturer\u2019s failure to warn. Generally, a defendant cannot both cause and prevent harm from a product. Here, the defendant is the manufacturer, which had a duty to the mother, so it was the mother's conduct that was the proximate cause of harm. D is incorrect because it is a misstatement of the law. The manufacturer\u2019s duty is to the mother, so it is the mother's knowledge that determines whether the defendant (the manufacturer) has a duty to the daughter, not the other way around. The manufacturer\u2019s duty is to the mother, not the daughter. Thus, it is the mother, not the daughter, who should not have purchased the medication. The manufacturer had a duty to the mother to disclose the ingredients in the coating, and the mother did not know what those ingredients were. The manufacturer failed to meet its duty, and that failure was the proximate cause of harm to the daughter."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

The farmer did not communicate with the manufacturer of the milking system or any of its agents before purchasing the system. The distributor knew that the farmer had several lucrative contracts with milk wholesalers, but the manufacturer was unaware of these contracts. The system never operated properly because of a manufacturing defect, and as a result the dairy farmer lost much of the wholesale contract revenue. Does the farmer have a viable strict products liability claim against the manufacturer for recovery of his lost revenue?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because of the economic loss doctrine.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was not aware of the farmer\u2019s wholesale contracts.\nC. Yes, because the consequential damages rule of contract law does not apply in a products liability action in which the product was in fact defective.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. With the economic loss doctrine, a plaintiff generally may not seek pure economic damages in a tort action. However, this doctrine is limited to claims for pure economic loss resulting from a breach of duty in a commercial transaction. Here, the farmer is asserting a claim for strict products liability, which is not a breach of duty. Therefore, the economic loss doctrine does not apply and the farmer may seek to recover all of his damages, including his lost revenue. As such, A is incorrect. The economic loss doctrine does not state that a plaintiff may not recover any damages in cases involving strict products liability. B is incorrect. The manufacturer had no knowledge of the farmer's wholesale contracts. Even if the manufacturer had knowledge of the contracts, however, the farmer would be limited to recovering only those damages within the control of the manufacturer. The farmer's lost revenue is not within the control of the manufacturer and therefore would not be recoverable under this theory. C is incorrect. The consequential damages rule of contract law only applies to breach of warranty claims. It has no application to claims under strict products liability. The farmer is not asserting a breach of warranty claim. Instead, he is asserting a strict products liability claim for damages caused by a product defect. D is correct. Strict products liability allows a plaintiff to recover for all foreseeable damages caused by a defective product, including consequential damages. Here, the manufacturer's negligence in failing to properly design and manufacture the milking system caused the farmer to lose his lucrative wholesale contracts. As such, the farmer is entitled to recover his lost revenue, which is a foreseeable consequence of the product defect. A, B, and C are incorrect."

In this case, the only harm suffered by the farmer was lost revenue, and strict products liability does not apply when a defective product causes only economic loss, as opposed to personal injury or property damage. Answer B is incorrect. The problem is not the manufacturer\u2019s lack of knowledge about the farmer\u2019s contracts but the rule that prevents an injured party from recovering for purely economic loss caused by a defective product. Answer C is incorrect. The statement is true, but it does not entitle the farmer to damages. The contract law rule of consequential damages is irrelevant to the resolution of a tort claim.

Under the sponsorship agreement, the dealership was required to arrange for licensed and trained emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to be present during the race.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The dealership may not escape liability simply by hiring another to perform a negligent act. When the potential for harm is so great, a plaintiff can allege and prove that the defendant had a nondelegable duty to perform the task itself. In this case, the plaintiff can argue that the risk of harm to the motorcyclist was so great that the dealership had a nondelegable duty to provide its own emergency care at the race. Therefore, the dealership is directly liable for any damages caused by its negligent act (hiring the EMS firm) or its negligent failure to train (the EMT twisting the motorcyclist's neck). A is incorrect. The dealership is not directly liable for hiring the EMS firm. The motorcyclist's negligence claim is against the EMS firm, not the dealership. The motorcyclist is not alleging that the dealership was negligent in hiring the EMS firm. Instead, he is alleging that the EMS firm was negligent in its care of the motorcyclist. C is incorrect. The dealership is not vicariously liable for the EMT's negligence. The EMT's negligence is within the scope of her employment only to the extent that her harm to the motorcyclist occurred during the race. D is incorrect. The dealership is not exempt from liability simply because it hired the EMS firm. As stated above, the motorcyclist can allege that the dealership had a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care at the race, and is therefore directly liable for any damages caused by its negligence. Additionally, the motorcyclist can argue that the EMT's negligence was outside the scope of her employment, thus absolving the EMS firm of liability. The motorcyclist's claims are against both the EMS firm and the dealership."
