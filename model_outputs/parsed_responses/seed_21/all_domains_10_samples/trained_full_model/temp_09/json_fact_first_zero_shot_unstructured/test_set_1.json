            "explanation": " Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to cases that involve diversity of parties, and specifies that district courts shall have original jurisdiction in such cases. Before the federal courts can exercise diversity jurisdiction, however, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that it lies. When a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court, the district court must determine whether it has jurisdiction over the case. To do so, it will look to the caption of the complaint to see where the parties reside. If the complaint's caption does not indicate where the parties reside, the court may ask the parties to disclose their residence. If the court cannot find that the parties are diverse, it will not have diversity jurisdiction and the court may dismiss the case. Where the shareholder brings suit against the car manufacturing company, the shareholder will likely be a resident of one state, and the company will likely be a resident of a different state. The shareholder's attorney, therefore, will need to determine whether the shareholder and the company are residents of the same state so that it can determine whether the court can or should ask the parties to disclose their residence."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect.

In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal.

In this case, the defendant has not met its burden because it has not shown that the errors were plain."

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC.

In doing so, the plaintiff is considered to have waived the right to claim negligence. There are, however, several requirements before the assumption-of-risk doctrine will be applied. First, there must be a known danger. Second, the danger must be one that the plaintiff has voluntarily assumed. Third, when the danger is one that is reasonably foreseeable, the defendant must have knowledge, or reason to know, of the assumption of risk. Fourth, the plaintiff's assumption of the risk must be within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the occurrence. In this case, there is a known danger (boxes) and it is a danger that is reasonably foreseeable. It is also within the contemplation of the parties, because the driver was the one who observed the boxes before asking for help, and it was her truck that was involved.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date.

However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect.

The clause does not limit the power of the federal government to protect its own interests. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. B is correct. The Arrest Clause of the writ of habeas corpus prohibits any one except a magistrate from arresting a person and holding him in custody. The Arrest Clause does not, however, prevent an officer from carrying out a valid arrest. C is incorrect. The federal statute does not violate the Tenth Amendment. The amendment merely states that powers not granted to the federal government are reserved to the states or the people. It does not impose any restrictions on the federal government. D is incorrect. The Constitution does not guarantee the availability of the writ of habeas corpus. The writ is a procedural device that is only available when the statute or constitutional provision under which someone is held authorizes it."

Finally, even if the injury were suffered, the injury would not be of the sort that can be redressed by the relief the company is seeking, which is an injunction. Injunctions are extraordinary remedies that are not to be granted lightly. The harm, if any, is within the authority of the executive branch and therefore cannot be redressed by an injunction.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC. Order the company to give the resident an opportunity for a hearing, because the Fourteenth Amendment applies to private entities performing public functions.\nD.

            "explanation": " This is a due process case. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that not only the federal government, but also state governments, must afford a deprived person the opportunity to be heard before a decision may be made that will deprive the person of a state-conferred right or benefit. In this case, the city council conferred the privately owned company the franchise to supply water to the city's residents. The council did not take the water facility off the city's control, but merely removed it from city ownership. Because the council's decision to grant the franchise to the company was a state action, the company's termination of the resident's water service will also be a state action. Therefore, the company must afford the resident the opportunity to be heard before it terminates the resident's water service. Answer A is incorrect because the presence or absence of state action is an affirmative defense that must be raised by the defendant. It is not the court's role to determine whether an action is state action. Answer B is incorrect because merely being three months behind in payments does not entitle the company to summarily terminate the resident's service. The company's policy of summarily terminating service to customers who fall more than two months behind in their payments does not pass rational basis review, and therefore cannot be said to be a reasonable means of serving the government's legitimate interest. Answer C is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause does not impose a general substantive due process clause. Therefore, the court cannot order the company to give the resident an opportunity for a hearing based upon a generalized belief that the termination of service may deprive the resident of a liberty interest. Answer D is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not impose a substantive due process clause. Therefore, the court cannot order the company to give the resident an opportunity for a hearing based upon a generalized belief that the termination of service may deprive the resident of a liberty interest."

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts.

It must also be consistent with the Statute of Frauds, which requires that any contract with regard to sale or conveyance of land must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. Thus, the instruction should have stated that evidence of the creation of an implied-in-fact contract must be consistent with these other requirements as well as with the conduct of the parties. Without this qualification, the instruction gives the jury too much leeway to find an implied-in-fact contract where one does not exist."

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC.

As a matter of policy, courts will not interpret a writing so as to allow one party to avoid it when that party could have easily corrected the error. Here, because the contractor did not want to avoid the contract, it will be interpreted in a way that will allow the contractor to keep it. As such, answer A is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

In return for his daughter\u2019s promise to pay $300,000 to his nephew at the time of the father\u2019s death, the father executed and delivered to his daughter a quitclaim deed to the land. The daughter took possession of the land. Two years later, in a signed writing, the father directed his daughter to pay to a neighbor, at the father\u2019s death, $50,000 of the $300,000 that was to go to the nephew. The daughter, who had long disliked the neighbor, told her father that she did not plan to honor his request. The father died, and his daughter has since refused to pay anything to either the nephew or the neighbor. The neighbor has sued the daughter for the $50,000. Is the neighbor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter did not consent to any modification of the contract she had made with her father.\nB. No, because the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, and the nephew\u2019s interest could not be modified without his express written consent.\nC.

The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of extrinsic evidence of certain statements made by the parties outside of the written agreement. Any statement by the father in his signed writing that contradicts the writing will be considered a modification of the contract, and will therefore be subject to the requirements of consideration. Here, the father\u2019s signed writing is inconsistent with the original contract between the daughter and the father, and will therefore be subject to the requirement of consideration.

The company has a duty to take reasonable steps to make the premises reasonably safe, to conduct active operations with reasonable care for the presence of its invitees, and, under limited circumstances, to protect its customers against the acts of third persons. The facts of this case create several issues that could support an argument that the company had not upheld its duties. First, the company's failure to monitor the cousin's use of its website could constitute a failure to take reasonable steps to make the premises reasonably safe. Second, the company's failure to remove the cousin's notice after it became apparent that the notice was a trap for the homeowner could constitute a failure to conduct active operations with reasonable care. Finally, the company's failure to screen the cousin's use of its website could constitute a violation of its duty to protect against the acts of third persons. A is incorrect. The company has a duty to take reasonable steps to make the premises reasonably safe, to conduct active operations with reasonable care for the presence of its invitees, and, under limited circumstances, to protect its customers against the acts of third persons. Here, the company's failure to monitor the cousin's use of its website could constitute a failure to take reasonable steps to make the premises reasonably safe. B is incorrect. The cousin's actions are an ordinary cause of the homeowner's loss, and cannot, on their own, constitute a defense to a negligence action. C is incorrect. The U.S. Supreme Court has not held that the First Amendment prohibits all tort actions based upon mere speech. Any such decision would be a matter of judicial policy, and is therefore beyond the scope of the question. Additionally, the facts of this case do not involve any pure speech. The company's website allows for the posting of notices, and the company's failure to screen the cousin's use of the website could constitute a violation of the company's duty to protect against the acts of third persons."

The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB. No, because the former employee could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts.\nC.

            "explanation": "Tortious interference with a contract is a intentional interference with another's contractual rights, usually resulting in damage to the other party. It is not a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The party claiming interference must first show it had a valid contract with a party to the alleged interference. The party claiming interference then has the burden of showing that its interference was not intentional and was not an improper interference. The party claiming interference may also argue that the interference was privileged. A privilege is a justification for conduct that would otherwise constitute a tort. The most common privilege in this case would be the privilege of competition. This is a defense to a claim of tortious interference with a contract. It allows competitors to compete in good faith without fear of liability for tortious interference. In this case, the former employee is a competitor of the established cemetery. The established cemetery has statutory authority to sell pre-need funeral plans, and the privilege of competition extends to statutorily authorized businesses. Therefore, the former employee's actions will be privileged and the established cemetery will not prevail."

The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

Frightened, a passenger pried the inside doors open and impulsively stuck his arm through them to try to stop the fall. As a result, his arm was broken. The elevator eventually stopped without causing further injuries. In a negligence action brought by the injured passenger against the company that installed and maintained the elevator, the injured passenger has asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that it may find the company negligent on a theory of res ipsa loquitur. In response, the company has argued that the passenger\u2019s conduct caused his injuries. How should the judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The judge should deny the passenger\u2019s request, because it is possible that the company was not negligent.\nB. The judge should deny the passenger\u2019s request, because the jury could find that the conduct of the passenger contributed to his injuries.\nC.

As such, the plaintiff may rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to determine whether the defendant was negligent. However, because the plaintiff himself may have contributed to his own injury, he cannot recover damages if the defendant has not also breached a duty owed to the plaintiff. In this case, the plaintiff should not recover damages if the jury finds that the company was not negligent; doing so would reward the plaintiff for his own negligence. However, if the jury finds that the company was negligent, the plaintiff should be awarded damages, but only to the extent that the defendant's negligence was the cause of his injury. The jury, in its verdict, should apportion damages between the negligence of the company and the negligence of the plaintiff."

On the day he arrived, just after sunset, he took his bag upstairs to a second-floor bedroom and unpacked.

The plaintiff cannot recover damages for that injury. This is an appropriate (paraphrased) instruction for the court to give to the jury when the jurisdiction recognizes the traditional common law assumption of risk doctrine. The plaintiff has the burden of both (1) proving that the defendant had a duty to the plaintiff, and (2) overcoming the assumption of risk doctrine.

If the plaintiff succeeds in overcoming the assumption of risk doctrine, then the jury should be instructed to use the facts in the case to determine the percentage of responsibility of the defendant and the plaintiff. If the plaintiff is a licensee, the plaintiff cannot recover damages, even if the defendant was negligent. The defendant is strictly liable for any injury to a licensee.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the contractor and the homeowner, because neither posted a warning that the porch boards had been loosened.\nB. Neither the homeowner nor the contractor, because the friend was a licensee.\nC. The contractor only, because he was an independent contractor and he loosened the boards in a dangerously deceptive fashion without posting a warning.\nD. The homeowner only, because she insisted on having the old boards removed in a dangerously deceptive fashion and posted no warning.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": " Because the friend was not a party to the contract between the homeowner and the contractor, he had no obligation to inquire as to the condition of the porch boards. Therefore, neither the contractor nor the homeowner are strictly responsible for the friend's injuries. However, because the facts indicate negligence on the part of both the contractor and the homeowner, the court could find that each of them had a duty to use reasonable care to avoid exposing the friend to the boards' sharp edges. If it finds that they did not do so, it could find both of them responsible for the friend's injuries. Thus, answer A is incorrect. The facts of this case do not fit the facts of the situations in the other answer choices. In those cases, only one party had duties owed to the plaintiff that were not discharged. Here, both parties had duties that they did not discharge. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. The facts of this case are more analogous to the facts of a premises liability case involving a visitor. Generally, the owner of the land has a duty to take reasonable steps to make the land reasonably safe or to give warning of any hidden dangers. If the owner has invited the visitor to be on the land, the owner's duty is to take reasonable steps to make the land reasonably safe or to warn of any hidden dangers that are not apparent. The extent of that duty depends upon whether the visitor is a customer, a salesperson, or a trespasser. The duty is higher for a customer than it is for a trespasser. However, even a trespasser is entitled to some degree of care. Thus, the answer is C."

The photograph will not be admitted, however, if it is a representation of the actual scene of the incident. This is because a representation is not a depiction or a recording of the actual scene. It is a different mode of expression. The witness's testimony as to the technology used to take the photograph will not be relevant to the admissibility of the photograph, so answer B is incorrect. The witness's testimony will, however, be relevant to the weight to be given to the photograph, so answer A is correct.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph \u201cis what the proponent claims it is.\u201d The witness\u2019s proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw it.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying.

Therefore, the prosecutor cannot make the showing of intent required for forfeiture of either objection. Answers A and B are incorrect for the reasons set out above.   Answer D is incorrect. The federal courts have held that a trial judge may find the threshold requirements for forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence.

An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103.

Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103.

In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect.

It is inadmissible unless it falls within one of the hearsay exceptions.

The defense may offer extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for the limited non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness after the witness has been given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Answer A is incorrect. The witness\u2019s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose. And since there is no applicable hearsay exception for the witness\u2019s statement to the investigator, it cannot be admitted to prove that the plaintiff did not fall.",

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her. The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB. No, because the contract between the woman and her friend merged into the deed.\nC. Yes, because the parties agreed that the woman could live on the land.\nD.

The dealer can also be convicted of murder because he knew that the lookout was in serious danger, he had the required malice, and he did not try to stop the killing once he realized that the lookout was wounded.

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000.

The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

            "explanation": " It is a common scheme and plan for two or more people to agree to commit a crime. Each person in the conspiracy can be charged with the conspiracy offense, even if only one person commits the overt act. Here, the man and his friend agreed to commit armed robbery, and the friend actually committed an overt act (showing a gun) in furtherance of the conspiracy. The man can properly be charged with the conspiracy to commit armed robbery."

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The man can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery because he and his friend agreed to commit that offense. Answer A is incorrect because the man did not agree to commit an armed robbery. The facts show that the man was unaware of the friend\u2019s gun. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers A and B. The man can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery but not conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Answer D is incorrect because, as noted, the man did conspire to commit a robbery. It does not matter that the robbery was unsuccessful; a conspiracy is complete when the agreement has been reached.",

As she rounded a sharp curve, she lost control of the car and crossed over to the shoulder on the other side of the road. Her car hit a truck that was parked on the shoulder with its hood up while its driver waited for a tow truck. The force of the collision threw the driver out of the truck and down an embankment. The driver died from his injuries. Driving above the speed limit and causing an accident can be charged as reckless driving, a misdemeanor in the jurisdiction.

On these facts, a jury could rationally find both that the woman was guilty of reckless driving and that her illegal conduct caused the truck driver\u2019s death. The woman\u2019s conduct constitutes involuntary manslaughter under a theory of \u201cmisdemeanor-manslaughter.\u201d Answer A is incorrect. The woman could be guilty of murder on a theory of malice aforethought only if she intended to kill the driver. But the facts do not remotely suggest that the woman had that intent. The facts also do not support any theory of imputed malice, such as felony murder or depraved indifference. Answer B is incorrect because the woman did not intend to kill the driver and thus cannot be guilty of voluntary manslaughter.

Under state law, police are required to obtain DNA samples from all persons arrested for felonies and to store those samples in a state registry. The police informed the defendant of the state law and said that they would be using a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample from him. The defendant did not object. The defendant was later acquitted of burglary. A year later, however, authorities matched the defendant\u2019s DNA to an unsolved sexual assault crime. The defendant, now charged with sexual assault, has moved to suppress the DNA sample as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court suppress the DNA sample?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant failed to lodge a timely objection to the sample collection.\nB. No, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nC.

The police were required by state law to obtain a DNA sample from the defendant, and to store that sample in a state registry. The collection of the defendant's DNA was a search, and therefore, was subject to the standards of the Fourth Amendment. The police obtained the defendant's DNA sample without a warrant, and therefore the search was illegal unless it fell within one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. The exception at issue is the good-faith reliance on a statute. For this exception to apply, the statute must be reasonably likely to produce the desired result. Here, the statute is overbroad and its application to the defendant violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Therefore, the sample should be suppressed."

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC.

            "explanation": " A defendant is entitled to present to the sentencer any relevant mitigating evidence of his character or circumstances, not intended to affect the guilt phase verdict but to persuade the sentencer to impose a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death. A defendant is also entitled to present evidence of his sordid upbringing, if it is relevant to his character or to the circumstances in which he killed. A defendant's sordid background is a mitigating factor that may be proven by extrinsic evidence. However, if a defendant elects to present evidence of his background, he must do so through live testimony. A defendant may not rest his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on a mere assertion that his lawyer failed to present mitigating evidence; the defendant must show that the evidence was indeed mitigating and that its failure to be presented was prejudicial. A court may grant a petition for post-conviction relief if it finds that the defendant has demonstrated that counsel's performance was not professionally reasonable and that the defendant was prejudiced by the omission. The court, in making this determination, considers whether the evidence was of a type that could not have been foreseen, and whether it bears upon a fundamental principle of human nature. If the evidence is of a type that could have been foreseen, and is merely cumulative of other evidence presented at trial, the court is less likely to find prejudice. If the evidence is of a type that could not have been foreseen, and bears upon a fundamental principle of human nature, the court is more likely to find prejudice. Counsel's decision not to probe into the defendant's background is an aspect of counsel's trial strategy. It does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel is required to adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case. The reasonableness of counsel's performance is measured against the standards of a reasonably competent attorney, considering the totality of the circumstances. It is not sufficient for a defendant to show that a different strategy would have been reasonable; he must show that the existing strategy was unreasonable. Thus, the defendant cannot prevail by showing that a better trial strategy would have been to ask the defendant's mother to testify. He must show that his actual trial strategy was unreasonable. In this case, it is unlikely that the court will find prejudice as the evidence is cumulative and bears upon a fundamental principle of human nature. Thus, the defendant is unlikely to prevail."

            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
