Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss.

The law here was passed after the woman committed the crime, so the law may not be applied to her.      Answer B is incorrect. Procedural due process requires that the government provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before depriving someone of a liberty interest or of an interest in property. The woman received that notice prior to trial, and the law provides an opportunity for a hearing. However, the law is an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to the woman. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest is not the proper standard. The ex post facto clause is violated by laws that increase the punishment for a crime after the crime was committed, even if the law furthers a legitimate interest. Answer D is incorrect. The law constitutes punishment because it increases the consequences for having been found guilty of committing a crime, and the law increases the punishment for the crime after the woman committed the crime, violating the ex post facto clause.",

Many political groups have contributed to that increase with their growing use of billboards to display messages that further a variety of political candidates and public causes. The city council has received many complaints from residents claiming that the billboards are ugly and detract from picturesque sights along the roadways.

A company that owns many of the billboards affected by this ordinance has filed suit, claiming that the ordinance violates the company\u2019s freedom of speech. Should the court uphold the ordinance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the ordinance burdens political speech and is not necessary to further a compelling government interest.\nB.

The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed.

However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A.

Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.

Acting with the intent to cause offensive or harmful contact, the driver caused an offensive or harmful contact.      Answer A is incorrect. The driver is not guilty of attempted murder because the facts do not suggest that he intended to kill the bicyclist. Answer B is incorrect. The driver is not guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter because the facts do not suggest that he intended to kill the bicyclist. The driver cannot be guilty of attempted involuntary manslaughter because, at common law, that crime did not exist. (Attempted negligence is a legal impossibility.) Answer D is incorrect because the question calls for the most serious crime of which the driver can be convicted. At common law, assault required only placing another person in fear of imminent harm. Here, the driver committed the greater offense of engaging in physical contact.",

However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

Had the error been preserved by a contemporaneous objection, the standard of review would be more favorable to the defendant.",

Assuming no applicable statutes, is the friend likely to prevail in an action to rescind his purchase of the car from the woman?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the friend\u2019s reliance on the odometer reading was unreasonable, given that he did not have his mechanic check the mileage before he bought the car.\nB.

The lease does not explicitly say that the owner may enter the house to show it to prospective lessees, but such a right may be fairly implied in order to carry out the intention of the parties. Answer A is incorrect. The principle of reasonable expectations posits that parties should not be bound by terms that they would not expect to find in a contract unless those terms were called to their attention. That doctrine is not relevant here. Answer C is incorrect. Best efforts is a duty read into a contract to prevent it from being illusory when the scope of a party\u2019s performance is omitted or unclear. The duty of best efforts, which requires all parties to use their best efforts to carry out the intent of the contract, is not relevant here. Answer D is incorrect.

Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 240. Answer D is incorrect. Contract law generally does not distinguish between willful breaches and other breaches. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374; Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 12.3. This situation would not require a court to consider the reason for breach.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. If a buyer repudiates a contract for unfinished goods, the seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment proceed in any reasonable manner, including finishing the goods for resale. UCC \u00a7 2- 704(2). The seller\u2019s damages in that situation are the difference between the contract price and the resale price. UCC \u00a7 2- 706(1). Here that amount is $8,000. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale. Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale rather than seeking costs and lost profit. Note that this has the effect of reducing the seller\u2019s damages.      Answer D is incorrect. In the common law case of Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co., 35 F.2d 301 (4th Cir. 1929), the court held that the seller had a duty not to complete a bridge after the buyer repudiated. But UCC Article Two has a different rule, because unlike a completed bridge, completed goods can be resold to avoid or reduce loss.",

The witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception, however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement must be excised from the report. Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under      a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action.

One year later, a fire completely destroyed the woman\u2019s house and its contents, and she learned that the policy covered the cost of rebuilding the house but not the cost of replacing the contents. The woman sued the insurance company for breach of contract, claiming that when the agent sold her the policy, he did not notify her, as was legally required, that she would have to purchase a supplemental policy to cover the house\u2019s contents. At trial, the woman testified that the agent had not provided the required notice. The agent\u2019s supervisor plans to testify that the company issues thousands of policies through its agents each year and that it is the routine practice of those agents to discuss supplemental policy options with each customer. The woman\u2019s attorney has objected to this proffered testimony. Should the court allow the supervisor\u2019s testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because evidence of routine practice is not admissible when an eyewitness denies that the practice was followed.\nB.

The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury.

One trial witness was a child who had seen one of the killings. Before calling the child to testify, the prosecution moved to remove the defendant from the courtroom, arguing that the child would be intimidated by seeing the defendant. The court denied the motion. When the child entered the courtroom to testify, the defendant became unruly, moving as though he was about to lunge from his chair toward the child. The judge warned the defendant to stop the behavior. After a second warning, the judge told the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to behave inappropriately. The defendant then shouted a threat at the child. At that point, the court ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom. When the child finished testifying, subject to full cross-examination by defense counsel, the defendant was allowed back into the courtroom. The trial concluded, and the jury convicted the defendant. The defendant appealed the conviction, challenging only his exclusion from the courtroom. Should the court of appeals reverse the conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a defendant may be excluded from the courtroom to protect a minor witness from further trauma.\nB. No, because the right to be present can be forfeited by disruptive behavior.\nC.

The prosecutor\u2019s first question during her cross-examination is, \u201cOn the day of the robbery, you were questioned by an investigator and told him that [the defendant] had left the house by 8 a.m., didn\u2019t you?\u201d The girlfriend denies having made the statement and says that the investigator must have misunderstood her. In rebuttal, the prosecutor proposes to call the investigator, who would testify that the girlfriend told him in their interview that the defendant had left the house by 8 a.m. on the day of the robbery. The defendant objects to the investigator\u2019s proposed testimony about the girlfriend\u2019s prior statement. Should the court allow the investigator\u2019s testimony about the girlfriend\u2019s prior statement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Answer A is incorrect. FRE 613(b) permits proof of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence so long as the witness has an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Here, the girlfriend had that opportunity and denied the statement, making proof of the statement by extrinsic evidence permissible. Answer B is incorrect.

The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

The court denied the motion and sent the case to the jury, which returned a verdict for the plaintiff and awarded damages. Five weeks after the court entered judgment on the verdict, the defendant filed a renewed motion for JMOL. One week after that motion was filed, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to extend the time to file and respond to posttrial motions. In the stipulation, the defendant acknowledged that it had filed its renewed JMOL motion late, citing computer difficulties relating to an office move. The plaintiff has acknowledged that it suffered no prejudice as a result of the late renewal motion but opposes it. Is the court likely to consider the renewed JMOL motion on the merits?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the deadline for filing a renewed JMOL motion cannot be extended.\nB. No, because the defendant failed to show good cause for its delay in filing the motion.\nC.

If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

Both the grantor (the father) and the bona fide purchaser (the investor) are innocent; however, the father is favored as he is entirely blameless. Answer C is incorrect. The father\u2019s executed will gave no rights, at the time of the will\u2019s execution, to any beneficiaries named in the will. Whether the wife owns the apartment building depends on whether the father owned the building when he died.",

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC. Yes, because acceleration is required before a foreclosure action can be initiated.\nD. Yes, because the lapse in insurance coverage constituted a material default of the terms of the mortgage.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

While typically triggered by nonpayment of the mortgage debt, they can also be triggered by the mortgagor\u2019s failure to satisfy other conditions in the mortgage, such as timely payment of insurance premiums. Answer A is incorrect. Once acceleration has properly occurred, the consequences cannot be avoided because the owner attempts to pay the delinquent insurance premium. Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect. The desire to bring a foreclosure action does not create a right to accelerate a mortgage. Rather, the right to accelerate depends upon whether a term of a mortgage has been breached. Such a term may include, as here, the failure to pay an insurance premium.",

The man purchased a three-acre tract of land knowing that the applicable zoning law required any home to be surrounded by least two acres of vacant land. The man created the hardship by building the home on his land in a location that left an insufficient amount of land to satisfy the zoning law if he built a second home. The man cannot take advantage of the hardship he created. Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the land is used for residential purposes is irrelevant. An area variance may be granted in the residential setting but not when the hardship is self-created. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the deed contained a covenant noting that the land can be used only for residential      purposes is irrelevant.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other.

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter.

Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee.

The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met). Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer D is incorrect. The mere knowledge that the sand needed to be properly mixed with water and cement to make sound concrete is not sufficient to render the distributor liable for an injury caused by the defective concrete.",

The question is not about the standard of care applicable to the doctor and the store, but rather whether the store, if found negligent, can be held responsible along with the doctor not only for the shopper\u2019s initial injury but also for the worsening of the injury as a result of the doctor\u2019s malpractice.

Intrusion upon seclusion is one of the four privacy torts recognized by the Second Restatement of Torts and most states. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A\u2013E (1977). Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the company did not expressly authorize the security officer\u2019s specific actions does not necessarily allow it to avoid liability. The security officer was an employee of the company, and the company both directed the officer to investigate the woman and provided the officer with her phone number. On this basis, a jury could reasonably hold the company liable based on the officer\u2019s actions. Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s breach of the noncompetition agreement, if any, would not prevent a reasonable jury from concluding that the company is liable to the woman for intrusion upon seclusion. Whether the company has a cause of action against the woman for breach of the agreement is a separate question. Answer C is incorrect. There is no evidence that the company or the security officer acted with an intent to cause the woman severe emotional distress, or recklessly with respect to that risk, or even that the woman suffered severe emotional distress.",

The manufacturer, at the time of entering into the contract with the distributor, falsely stated to the distributor that it did not have a plan in place to cease providing products for sale in State A. This was an intentional and material misrepresentation, made for the purpose of deceiving the distributor, on which misrepresentation the distributor actually and reasonably relied to its detriment. As such, it supports a fraud claim by the distributor. Answer A is incorrect. The distributor may sue for fraud regardless of whether the distributor also has a valid claim for breach of contract. Answer B is incorrect. The manufacturer affirmatively misrepresented a material fact when it falsely stated that it had no plan in place to cease doing business in State A. Answer D is incorrect. This answer points to a fact\u2014the manufacturer\u2019s reservation of a right to do business with other distributors\u2014that is irrelevant to the question of whether the manufacturer is subject to liability for fraud.",

The packaging indicated that the pills were \u201ccoated\u201d but did not list the ingredients in the coating. A few days after she bought the medication, because the daughter was in extreme pain, the mother gave the daughter three times the recommended dose of the medication. Thirty minutes later, because the daughter had a very rare allergy to an ingredient in the coating, she had a severe allergic reaction, for which she was hospitalized. The mother was aware of the daughter\u2019s allergy, but she did not know that the medication contained the ingredient to which the daughter was allergic. In a failure-to-warn action brought against the manufacturer of the medication, which of the arguments below would be the LEAST promising as a defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter\u2019s allergy to the ingredient in the coating was very rare.\nB. The manufacturer\u2019s duty was to warn learned intermediaries, not consumers of the medication.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",
