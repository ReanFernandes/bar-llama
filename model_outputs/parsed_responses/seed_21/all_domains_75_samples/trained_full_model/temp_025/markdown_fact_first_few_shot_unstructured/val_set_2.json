The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn a suit based on a will, inheritance of $1 million depended upon whether the wife had survived her husband when both died in the crash of a small airplane. An applicable statute provided that, for purposes of distributing an estate after a common disaster, there was a rebuttable presumption that neither spouse had survived the other. A witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane she heard what she thought was a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d although by the time the two occupants were removed from the wreckage they were both dead. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.\nB. No, because the witness\u2019s testimony is too speculative to support a finding.\nC. Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.\nD.

This answer correctly states the rule, but it is incorrect because under Rule 611(b), the court does not need to declare the manager hostile before the cross-examination can go beyond the scope of the direct examination. The rule permits cross-examination to go beyond the scope of the direct examination without any special declaration by the court as long as the cross-examiner offers a proper basis for the expansion of the examination. Thus, Answer B is incorrect because it misstates the rule. C is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because it misstates the rule. The cross-examiner is permitted to explore matters relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility, but only to the extent the cross-examiner offers a proper basis for the expansion of the examination. Thus, Answer C is incorrect because it misstates the rule. D is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because it misstates the rule. The rule provides that the cross-examination of a witness is limited to the subject matter of the direct examination, and it does not provide for unlimited cross-examination of a party's agent simply because the agent is an agent. Thus, Answer D is incorrect because it misstates the rule."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

At trial, the prosecutor called the bank teller to testify that the signature on the check was forged. Is the bank teller\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because a bank teller is by occupation an expert on handwriting.\nB. Yes, because it is rationally based on the bank teller\u2019s perception and is helpful to the jury.\nC. No, because the bank teller was at fault in allowing loss of the original by failing to secure the check.\nD.

The bank teller's testimony is admissible because it is relevant to the charge of attempting to cash a forged check, and it is helpful to the jury in determining whether the man is guilty. The bank teller's testimony is based on her perception, and is rationally related to the charge. A is incorrect because, although a bank teller may be an expert on handwriting, the bank teller is not testifying as an expert. The bank teller is simply giving her testimony as to what she saw. If a bank teller were testifying as an expert, then the teller would have to be tested on her expertise through a voir dire examination. However, since the teller is not testifying as an expert, the teller does not have to be tested. C is incorrect because the bank teller is not responsible for the loss of the original check. The man, not the teller, is responsible for making sure that the check is secure. D is incorrect because it is not necessary for the jury or an expert to compare the signature to determine whether it is forged. The bank teller's testimony is admissible because the jury does not need to see the original check to determine whether the signature is forged."

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA state statute provides as follows: \u201cIn all criminal cases, whenever the Constitution permits, the burden of proof as to a defense claimed by the defendant shall rest on the defendant, and the magnitude of the burden shall be as great as the Constitution permits.\u201d The same state defines the crime of forcible rape as follows: \u201cForcible rape consists of sexual penetration inflicted on an unconsenting person by means of force or violence. Consent of the victim is a complete defense to a charge of rape.\u201d At a defendant\u2019s trial for forcible rape, he testified that the alleged victim had consented to having sexual intercourse with him. How should the trial judge instruct the jury regarding the issue of consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by a preponderance of the evidence, rests on the defendant.\nB. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by clear and convincing evidence, rests on the defendant.\nC. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the defendant.\nD. The burden of proving that the victim did not consent, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the prosecution.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "B is correct. The forcible rape statute, in defining the crime, uses the term \"force or violence.\" The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the term \"force\" in a rape statute means \"the application of physical force that causes or threatens to cause bodily injury.\" Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990). The term \"violence\" has not been defined by the Supreme Court, but the term is generally understood to mean the use or threat of use of physical force. The Court has held that the term \"threat of force\" includes the threat of bodily injury. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259 (1997). Thus, the term \"force or violence\" in the statute means the application of physical force that causes or threatens to cause bodily injury, or the use or threat of use of physical force. The defendant has the burden of proving that the alleged victim consented to sexual intercourse by means of the force or violence he used. The magnitude of the burden is clear and convincing evidence."

Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun. The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to suppress its use as evidence. Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.\nB. Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.\nC. No, because, having found the package, the agents had probable cause to believe more narcotics could be located in\nthe house and the gun was found in a proper search for narcotics.\nD.

However, by the time the warrant was executed, the man had not opened the package and, thus, there was no probable cause to search for heroin or any other contraband inside the package. A is incorrect. The warrant was not used to search for the machine gun, so there was no search exceeding the authority granted by the warrant. C is incorrect.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

As soon as the undercover officer handed over the heroin, other officers moved in and arrested the dealer. The jurisdiction follows the common law approach to conspiracy. Could the dealer properly be convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because there was no overt act.\nB. No, because there was no plurality of agreement.\nC.

At common law, selling to a person who plans to use the weapon unlawfully is not sufficient for accomplice liability."

The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization\u2019s request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization\u2019s placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator\u2019s decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the administrator\u2019s denial of space to the organization was a reasonable time, manner, and place\nrestriction of speech.\nB.

The state has substantial interests in protecting the privacy of accident victims and in regulating the medical profession, but the law is not narrowly tailored to achieve those objectives. The law prohibits all solicitation by medical care providers, which is a more burdensome restriction than is necessary to achieve the state\u2019s objectives. D is incorrect. The law is not a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation. The law does not regulate the time, place, and manner of speech, but rather the content of the speech."

The United States Forest Service recently issued a permit to a private developer to construct a ski facility in an area that includes the sites that are sacred to the group. The group filed suit in federal district court against the Forest Service to force cancellation of the permit.

For the injury to be redressed, the court must be able to tailor the relief to eliminate the burden on the group\u2019s religious practices without unduly burdening the Forest Service\u2019s interests in allowing the ski facility. Thus, C is the only answer that appropriately states the relief that the group is seeking and the injury that it has suffered. A is incorrect. The comparison to other religious groups is relevant to determine whether the burden on the group\u2019s religious practices is significant enough to constitute an injury, but it is not a sufficient basis for relief on its own. B is incorrect. The burden on the group\u2019s religious practices must be significant enough to constitute an injury before the group can prevail.

To receive such a license, the ordinance required the individuals to complete 10 hours of instruction in child care, undergo a background check, and pay a $100 fee. The ordinance affected women disproportionately to men, because female babysitters far outnumbered male babysitters in the city. City officials who promoted the measure said that the certification process would ensure that babysitters were adequately regulated for the health and safety of the city\u2019s children.

Although some might argue that a tax on the sale of newspapers is a tax on speech, the Supreme Court has held that such a tax is a tax on a privilege, and thus is within Congress\u2019s power to tax. B is incorrect. While the tax may be necessary to serve the compelling interest of balancing the federal budget, that interest is insufficiently compelling to overcome the prohibition against impairing the exercise of a fundamental right. Under U.S. Const., Amendment I, the freedom of the press is a fundamental right. Therefore, the tax would impair the exercise of that right, and is thus unconstitutional. C is incorrect.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn order to combat terrorism, Congress enacted a statute authorizing the President to construct surveillance facilities on privately owned property if the President determined that the construction of such facilities was \u201cnecessary to safeguard the security of the United States.\u201d The statute provided no compensation for the owner of the land on which such facilities were constructed and provided that the surveillance facilities were to be owned and operated by the United States government. Pursuant to this statute, the President has determined that the construction of a surveillance facility on a very small, unused portion of an owner\u2019s large tract of land is necessary to safeguard the security of the United States. The construction and operation of the facility will not affect any of the uses that the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land. The owner has filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the construction of a surveillance facility on the parcel of land at issue without compensation. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It would be a taking of the owner\u2019s property for which the owner must be compensated.\nB. It would single out the owner for adverse treatment in violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth\nAmendment.\nC. It would not interfere with any use the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land and, therefore, would not\nentitle the owner to any compensation.\nD.

Although the landowner had posted signs that said, \u201cNo Hunting\u2014No Trespassing,\u201d hunters frequently intruded to kill the deer. Recently, the landowner built an eight-foot chain-link fence, topped by three strands of barbed wire, across a gully on her land that provided the only access to the area frequented by the deer. A wildlife photographer asked the landowner for permission to enter the property to photograph the deer. Because the landowner feared that any publicity would encourage further intrusions, she denied the photographer\u2019s request. Frustrated, the photographer attempted to climb the fence. He became entangled in the barbed wire and suffered extensive lacerations. The wounds became infected and ultimately caused his death. The photographer\u2019s personal representative brought an action against the landowner. Will the plaintiff prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the landowner may not use deadly force to protect her land from intrusion.\nB. Yes, because the landowner had no property interest in the deer that entitled her to use force to protect them.\nC. No, because the photographer entered the landowner\u2019s land after the landowner had refused him permission to do so.\nD.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

No, because there are sufficient indicia of the driver\u2019s identity to support a verdict of liability.\nB. Yes, because the driver is a public figure.\nC.

The cigarette maker is liable because the ad is a commercial advertisement, and it is for the cigarette maker's own benefit that the ad is published. The driver has a claim because the ad is similar to the driver's distinctive race car, and the driver has been injured by the cigarette maker's use of the driver's likeness without permission. The cigarette maker's motion to dismiss will not be granted because there are sufficient indicia of the driver's identity to support a verdict of liability. B is incorrect.

However, the company\u2019s negligence was the cause in fact of the worker\u2019s injury. Causation is still present even though the worker\u2019s employer was also negligent. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the worker will prevail, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. Under the facts, company liability is not absolute. The company has a defense based on the doctrine of intervening cause if the worker\u2019s employer was also negligent. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the worker\u2019s employer\u2019s negligence is a superseding cause, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. The company\u2019s negligence is the cause in fact of the worker\u2019s injury. D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "B is correct. While swerving his truck at his friend may have been the driver's intent, the driver would not have acted with the intent to cause the friend's injuries. The driver would have been committing the tort of battery, which is the intentional infliction of a harmful contact upon another. The friend would be entitled to recover damages for the actual damages he suffered, which in this case were his medical expenses and pain and suffering. However, punitive damages are not recoverable in a battery action. A is incorrect. While the driver's intentional swerving may have been done with the intent to cause the friend injuries, the friend would not be entitled to recover for the harm to his reputation or emotional distress. These are the damages recoverable in an action for defamation, and since the driver has not defamed the friend, the friend would not be entitled to recover these damages. Under defamation law, the friend would only be entitled to recover for the actual damages he suffered, which in this case were his medical expenses and pain and suffering. C is incorrect. While the driver would not be committing the intentional infliction of a harmful contact upon the friend, the driver would be committing the tort of negligence. The friend would be entitled to recover damages for the actual damages he suffered, which in this case were his medical expenses and pain and suffering.

Battery is the application of force to the person resulting in bodily injury or offensive touching, without consent or privilege. Conversion is the wrongful taking and carrying away of another's property with the intent to permanently deprive that person of her interest in the property.

A buyer gave the seller a signed handwritten offer to purchase the house. The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller\u2019s home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance. The buyer declared the contract voided by the fire, but the seller asserted a right to enforce the contract despite the loss. There is no applicable statute. If a court finds for the seller, what is the likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The contract was construed against the buyer, who drafted it.\nB.

Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, where one party's performance under a contract requires a period of time to complete, that party is deemed to have completed performance as of the time the other party is required to perform. In this case, the closing was set for a specific date, and the seller was obligated to convey the property to the buyer. As soon as the buyer accepted the seller's offer, the seller was obligated to convey the property to the buyer. Although the seller had not physically vacated the premises, he had \"converted\" his interest in the property into a monetary claim by entering into the contract. As such, the seller was obligated to pay the buyer the value of his interest in the property, which was the fire's destruction of the property. A is incorrect. The contract is silent on the issue of insurance, and the buyer is not bound by the seller's failure to insure. B is incorrect.

The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her. After the farmer promptly and properly recorded that deed, the second bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the farm. The farmer denied the validity of the second bank\u2019s mortgage.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA seller who owned land in fee simple entered into a valid written agreement to sell the land to a buyer by installment purchase. The contract stipulated that the seller would deliver to the buyer, upon the payment of the last installment due, \u201ca warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\u201d The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The buyer entered into possession of the land. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the buyer discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on the land, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25 percent of the purchase price that the buyer had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the seller had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the seller. The value of the land was then four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller\u2019s alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the buyer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nB. Yes, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a mortgage and the outstanding mortgage impairs the\nbuyer\u2019s equity of redemption.\nC.

The seller has made all mortgage payments timely. The amount of the mortgage debt is 25 percent of the purchase price the buyer will pay, and the land is four times more valuable than the debt owed, so it is likely that the mortgage debt will be paid off by the time the seller must provide the warranty deed, and thus the buyer is not entitled to damages at this time.",

On April 27, the seller notified the buyer that she had discovered that the land was subject to a longstanding easement in favor of a corporation for a towpath for a canal, should the corporation ever want to build a canal. The buyer thought it so unlikely that a canal would be built that the closing should occur notwithstanding this outstanding easement. Therefore, the buyer notified the seller on April 28 that he would expect to close on May 1. When the seller refused to close, the buyer sued for specific performance. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the easement renders the seller\u2019s title unmarketable.\nB. No, because rights of third parties are unresolved.\nC. Yes, because the decision to terminate the contract for title not being marketable belongs only to the buyer.\nD.

Twelve years ago, the neighbor leased her land to some hunters. For the next 12 years, the hunters and the man who had rerouted the path used the path for access to the highway. A month ago, the neighbor discovered that part of the path was on her land. The neighbor told the man that she had not given him permission to cross her land and that she would be closing the rerouted path after 90 days. The man\u2019s land and the neighbor\u2019s land have never been in common ownership. The period of time necessary to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The period of time necessary to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. What should the lawyer tell the man concerning his right to use the rerouted path on the neighbor\u2019s land?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The easement must have been used for the length of time necessary to acquire it, which in this case is 10 years. The neighbor had not expelled the man from the easement, so the easement is presumed to be continuous. The neighbor's lease to the hunters did not terminate the easement, so the easement is presumed to be permanent. The neighbor's discovery of the easement and her 90-day notice to the man are insufficient to terminate the easement.

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \u201cIt is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\u201d Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor\u2019s intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor\u2019s proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000. The buyer knew nothing of the friend\u2019s mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot. Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her bank of the mortgage claimed by the investor\u2019s friend, the bank loaned her $15,000, and she gave the bank a note for $15,000 due in two years secured by a mortgage on the lot. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. At that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cNo conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\u201d Both notes are now due and both the investor and the buyer have refused to pay. The lot is now worth only $50,000. What are the rights of the investor\u2019s friend and the bank in the lot?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both mortgages are enforceable liens and the friend\u2019s has priority because it was first recorded.\nB.

The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee\u2019s will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. The grantee\u2019s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might\nhave.\nC.

In return, the client agreed to pay the architect a fee of $10,000 to be paid upon the house\u2019s completion. After completion, the client claimed erroneously but in good faith that the architect\u2019s plans were defective. The client orally offered to pay the architect $7,500 in full settlement of the claim for the fee. The architect orally accepted that offer despite the fact that the reasonable value of his services was in fact $10,000. The client paid the architect $7,500 pursuant to their agreement. The architect subsequently sued the client for the remaining $2,500. In a preliminary finding, the trier of fact found that there were no defects in the architect\u2019s plans. Will the architect be likely to prevail in his action against the client for $2,500?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because payment of $7,500 cannot furnish consideration for the architect\u2019s promise to surrender his claim.\nB. Yes, because the oral agreement to modify the written contract is not enforceable.\nC. No, because the architect\u2019s promise to accept $7,500 became binding when the client made the payment.\nD.

However, the client\u2019s duty to pay the contract price was not impaired by the architect\u2019s prior promise to accept $7,500, because the client\u2019s payment of $7,500 did not satisfy the architect\u2019s contractual duty to perform. As such, the architect\u2019s acceptance of the $7,500 payment is a new promise that provides consideration to support the client\u2019s return promise. B is incorrect. The agreement to pay $7,500 is enforceable, but it does not modify the original agreement. Under the preexisting contract, the client was obligated to pay $10,000 upon completion of the house. The agreement to pay $7,500 merely shifted the obligation to pay from upon completion to when the architect accepted the $7,500. C is incorrect. The architect\u2019s acceptance of the $7,500 payment from the client is a return promise that will enforce the client\u2019s duty to pay the contract price. D is incorrect.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The buyer can either accept or reject the different computer model and in either event recover damages, if any, for\nbreach of contract.\nB. The buyer can either accept or reject the different computer model, but if he rejects it, he will thereby waive any\nremedy for breach of contract.\nC.

On June 10, the seller sent a letter to the buyer stating that he would not breach the contract after all and that he was ready to perform his obligations. The letter was effective to revive the seller's duty to convey, and it was also effective to prevent the buyer from breaching his duty to pay. Therefore, Answer A is correct. B is incorrect. Under the terms of the contract, the seller was obligated to convey the land on July 1, and the buyer was obligated to pay the purchase price on that date. The contract did not require the seller to tender a conveyance before the buyer would be obligated to pay the purchase price. Therefore, Answer B is incorrect. C is incorrect. The seller's repudiation was not nonretractable.

The creditor\u2019s promise not to sue the debtor if the debtor pays $1,000 on December 1 is a promise to modify the terms of the debtor\u2019s pre-existing contractual obligation to pay $1,000 on March 1. Under the pre-existing contract, the creditor had a right to sue the debtor on March 1. By promising to refrain from suit, the creditor modified the contract and created a new obligation for the debtor to pay $1,000 on December 1. Under the pre-existing contract, the debtor had no obligation to pay $1,000 on December 1. Therefore, the creditor\u2019s promise is unenforceable because there is no consideration to support the creditor\u2019s modification of the debtor\u2019s contractual obligation. B is incorrect. The debtor\u2019s promise to pay $1,000 on December 1 is a promise to perform a pre-existing contractual obligation. Under the pre-existing contract, the debtor had a right to perform on December 1.

A promise to allow a debtor to delay payment on a past debt is enforceable, but only if the creditor has not yet received payment on that debt. In this case, the creditor had not received payment on the debt as of April 1, so the promise is not enforceable. D is incorrect. The debtor did not bargain for the creditor\u2019s forbearance.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

After completing 25 percent of the garage according to the homeowner\u2019s specifications, the builder demanded $2,000 as a reasonable progress payment. The homeowner refused, and the builder abandoned the job. If each party sues the other for breach of contract, which of the following will the court decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both parties are in breach, and each is entitled to damages, if any, from the other.\nB. Only the builder is in breach and liable for the homeowner\u2019s damages, if any.\nC.

However, where one party\u2019s performance requires a period of time to complete, that performance is due before the other party is obligated to perform unless the contract specifies otherwise. Because the contract was silent with respect to progress payments, the builder was required to complete performance before the homeowner was obligated to pay for any of the work the builder had performed. The builder therefore was required to complete the garage before the homeowner was obligated to pay any of the contract price, and its abandonment of the job constituted a willful breach of the contract. The homeowner, on the other hand, was not obligated to pay for any of the builder\u2019s performance until the builder had substantially completed the garage, and its refusal to pay the builder\u2019s demand for a progress payment did not constitute a willful breach of the contract. For these reasons, B is correct, and Answers A, C, and D are incorrect."

The contract price was $100,000 in cash, payable one month after a truck carrier delivered the painting to the collector. The painting was damaged in transit. The collector timely rejected it after inspection and immediately notified the gallery of the rejection. The gallery then sold the painting to a third party. It informed the collector that it would pick up the painting within a couple of weeks. Two weeks later, before the gallery picked up the painting, the collector sold the painting to an art admirer for $120,000 cash, after notifying her about the damage. If the collector\u2019s sale of the painting was NOT an acceptance of the goods, what is the maximum amount that the gallery is entitled to recover from the collector?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $120,000 (damages for conversion).\nB. $100,000 (the collector-gallery contract price).\nC. $20,000 (the excess of the market price over the contract price).\nD.

If the collector had merely refused to accept the goods, the gallery would have had a claim for breach of contract. But because the collector returned the goods promptly after inspection, his rejection was an acceptance of the gallery's offer for return of the goods. As an acceptance, it was effective immediately upon receipt by the gallery, and the gallery had a limited time to resell the goods. In this case, the gallery resold the painting to the third party two weeks after the collector's rejection. Thus, the maximum amount the gallery can recover is the amount by which the sale price to the art admirer exceeded the contract price."

On March 2, the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer\u2019s order was for a rush job, the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day\u2019s delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25,000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25,000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair.

The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement providing that the seller was to deliver 1,000 cases of candy bars to the buyer during the months of May and June. Under the agreement, the buyer was obligated to make a selection by March 1 of the quantities of the various candy bars to be delivered under the contract. The buyer did not make the selection by March 1, and on March 2 the seller notified the buyer that because of the buyer\u2019s failure to select, the seller would not deliver the candy bars. The seller had all of the necessary candy bars on hand on March 1 and made no additional sales or purchases on March 1 or March 2. On March 2, after receiving the seller\u2019s notice that it would not perform, the buyer notified the seller of its selection and insisted that the seller perform. The seller refused. If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, is the buyer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a contract did not exist until selection of the specific candy bars, and the seller withdrew its offer before\nselection.\nB. No, because selection of the candy bars by March 1 was an express condition to the seller\u2019s duty to perform.\nC. Yes, because a delay of one day in making the selection did not have a material effect on the seller.\nD. Yes, because upon the buyer\u2019s failure to make a selection by March 1, the seller had a duty to make a reasonable\nselection.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "B is correct. Under the terms of the agreement, the buyer was obligated to make a selection of the candy bars to be delivered by March 1. The seller, however, did not perform its duty to deliver under the contract. The seller's performance would have been due before the buyer's performance was due. The seller's failure to deliver after the buyer's selection was made is a total breach of the contract. A is incorrect. The agreement did not require a writing to be enforceable. Although the agreement did provide for a March 1 selection, the failure to make the selection did not cause the seller to be in breach of the contract. Under the terms of the agreement, the seller was obligated to deliver the candy bars in May and June, and the buyer's failure to make a selection did not cause a breach of the seller's duty to deliver. C is incorrect. The seller's performance would have been due before the buyer's performance was due. The seller's failure to deliver after the buyer's selection was made is a total breach of the contract. D is incorrect. The seller's performance would have been due before the buyer's performance was due. The seller's failure to deliver after the buyer's selection was made is a total breach of the contract."

            "explanation": "UCC \u00a7 2-311 imposes a duty on a buyer to cooperate by specifying the assortment of goods where the contract fails to so provide. A seller can treat the buyer\u2019s failure to specify as a breach by failure to accept the contracted-for goods only if the buyer\u2019s failure to specify materially impacts the seller\u2019s performance. The seller had an available supply of candy bars and had entered into no new contracts. These facts support the conclusion that the buyer\u2019s failure to select did not materially impact the seller\u2019s performance. Therefore the seller unjustifiably refused to accept the buyer\u2019s selection of goods. UCC \u00a7 2-311.",
