The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA homeowner was using a six-foot stepladder to clean the furnace in his home. The homeowner broke his arm when he slipped and fell from the ladder. The furnace had no warnings or instructions on how it was to be cleaned. In a suit by the homeowner against the manufacturer of the furnace to recover for his injury, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the danger of falling from a ladder is obvious.\nB. No, because the homeowner should have hired a professional to clean the furnace.\nC. Yes, because the furnace did not have a ladder attached to it for cleaning purposes.\nD. Yes, because the lack of warnings or instructions for how to clean the furnace made the furnace defective.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "D is correct. The homeowner's injury is the type of defective condition that would be found under a risk-utility balancing test. The issue is whether the benefit to the user of the furnace from not having a ladder attached to it outweighs the risk to the user from falling. Since the homeowner did not attach a ladder himself, he is not arguing that the furnace design caused him to fall, but rather that the lack of a ladder created a dangerous condition. Thus, D is correct, and A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because the fact that falling from a ladder is obvious does not mean that the manufacturer would be liable for the homeowner's injury. B is incorrect because the homeowner could have hired a professional to clean the furnace, but that would not have prevented his injury. C is incorrect because the fact that a ladder was not attached to the furnace when the homeowner fell does not mean that the manufacturer is liable."

A is incorrect. The negligent design of the car caused the accident, and it was foreseeable that rescuers would be injured.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA farmer kept antiques in an uninhabited farmhouse on his property. The farmhouse had been broken into several times in the past, and some of the farmer\u2019s goods had been stolen. Instead of posting \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, the farmer decided to install an alarm system to deter intruders. While the farmer was in the farmhouse installing the alarm system, he heard a window open in the adjoining room. The farmer crept very quietly to the door of the room, threw the door open, and found an intruder, a young child. The farmer immediately struck the child, a 10-year-old girl, very hard in the face, breaking her nose. In an action on behalf of the child against the farmer to recover for the injury to her nose, is the child likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the farmer did not use deadly force.\nB. No, because the farmer had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief.\nC. Yes, because the farmer should have posted a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign.\nD. Yes, because the farmer used excessive force.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

To protect himself from harm, the rancher could have retreated or used less-than-deadly force. Because D is correct, A is incorrect. The majority of states require that a defendant retreat before he can use deadly force, even in his own home. However, there are two important qualifications to this rule. First, the defendant's belief that he is threatened with death or great bodily harm must be reasonable. Second, the defendant's belief that retreat would be impracticable must also be reasonable. In this case, the rancher's belief that retreat would be impracticable is not reasonable. He could have, and should have, retreated. B is incorrect. While the rancher suspected that the neighbor was armed, that belief was not reasonable. To justify the use of deadly force, the rancher must have more than a subjective suspicion that the neighbor is armed. He must have an objective belief that the neighbor is a threat to his life. C is incorrect. While deadly force is generally only appropriate in cases where there is a threat to life or property, that force is generally not appropriate in property disputes.

            "explanation": "B is correct. To bring a claim for defamation, a plaintiff must establish the following common law elements: (i) defamatory language, (ii) publication of that language by the defendant to a third person, and (iii) damage to the reputation of the plaintiff. However, in a defamation action that involves a matter of public concern--here, a claim brought by a candidate for public office--the plaintiff must establish more than mere negligence with regard to the truth or falsity of the allegedly defamatory statement of fact. The plaintiff must establish that the defendant acted with actual malice, that is, that the defendant in fact knew the statement to be false or entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the statement. Here, the candidate cannot establish actual malice on the part of the editor in publishing the statement because the editor honestly believed the accusation was true. Thus, B is correct and A is incorrect. At common law, an editorial is considered opinion and thus is not defamatory per se. However, a statement that someone is an illegal drug user is defamatory per se because the statement implies that the person is unfit for public office. Thus, C is incorrect. D is incorrect. While the statement is defamatory per se, the plaintiff must establish more than mere negligence with regard to the truth or falsity of the statement. The candidate cannot establish actual malice on the part of the editor in publishing the statement because the editor honestly believed the accusation was true."

Rent was to be paid by the first day of each month, and the tenant paid the first month\u2019s rent at the time of the agreement. When the tenant arrived at the leased premises on July 1, the tenant learned that the previous tenant had not vacated the premises at the end of her lease term on May 31 and did not intend to vacate. The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession. The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. By suing the previous tenant for possession, the tenant elected that remedy in lieu of a suit against the landlord.\nB. The landlord had delivered the legal right of possession to the tenant.\nC. The tenant failed to timely vacate as required to sue for constructive eviction.\nD. The tenant had not notified the landlord before bringing the eviction action.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The landlord tenant statute at issue here is a \"no-fault\" statute, meaning that the landlord is not responsible for the tenant's loss unless the landlord's conduct is a willful violation of the statute.

Thus, A is incorrect. By suing the previous tenant for possession, the tenant did not elect that remedy in lieu of a suit against the landlord. B is incorrect. This answer is overly broad. The landlord has not delivered the legal right of possession to the tenant. The tenant has a right to possession, but not a legal right of possession. C is incorrect. The tenant did not vacate the premises before he brought the eviction action, so he is not subject to a claim of constructive eviction."

The cousin then entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to an investor with the closing to take place \u201cone week after [the cousin\u2019s] next birthday.\u201d The man failed to convey the farm to the cousin on her birthday. One week after the cousin\u2019s birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin\u2019s inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise. The investor considered suing the cousin but realized that she could not compel the cousin to convey the farm because it was still owned by the man. Two weeks after the cousin\u2019s birthday, the man died. Under his valid will, the man devised the farm to the cousin. Within a week, the executor of the man\u2019s estate gave the cousin an executor\u2019s deed to the farm in compliance with state law. The investor promptly learned of this transfer and demanded that the cousin convey the farm to her. The cousin refused. The investor sued the cousin for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The cousin, because the contract to convey was not signed by the legal owner of the farm as of the date of the contract\nand was therefore void.\nB. The cousin, because she received title by devise rather than by conveyance.\nC. The investor, because the contract to convey merged into the executor\u2019s deed to the cousin.\nD.

If at the time the contract was made the man had been dishonest in representing that he owned the farm, then A would be correct. However, in this case, the man had no reason to be dishonest about his ownership of the farm. He had every reason to believe that he would be able to convey the farm to the cousin by the closing date. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the man had to convey the farm to the cousin, but it is incorrect in its statement that the cousin received the farm by devise. The cousin did not receive the farm by will. Instead, she received the farm by executor\u2019s deed, which is a conveyance of land at any time after the death of the owner and before the distribution of the owner\u2019s estate. Such a deed is validly given, and the cousin is entitled to the land. D is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the contract to convey remained enforceable by the investor for a reasonable time after the closing date, but it is incorrect in its statement that the contract merged into the executor\u2019s deed to the cousin. A contract for the conveyance of land does not merge into a deed to the land. Instead, the contract for conveyance of land must be specifically identified in the deed to the land. C is correct. The contract to convey the farm to the investor by the closing date did not merge into the executor\u2019s deed to the cousin. The contract for conveyance of land must be specifically identified in the deed to the land.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA man decided to give his farm to his nephew.

None of these instructions to the attorney were in writing, and the deed was not recorded. The man then e-mailed the nephew informing him of the arrangement. Shortly thereafter, the nephew died testate. In his will, he devised the farm to his daughter. Several years later, the man died intestate, survived by two sons. The nephew\u2019s daughter immediately claimed ownership of the farm and demanded that the attorney deliver the deed to her. Must the attorney deliver the deed to the daughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a gratuitous death escrow is void unless supported by a written contract.\nB. No, because the man never placed the deed beyond his control.\nC. Yes, because the death of the nephew rendered the gratuitous death escrow irrevocable by the man.\nD.

Twenty years ago, the businesswoman conveyed the vacant tract to a grantee by a warranty deed that the businesswoman signed but the grantee did not. The deed contained a covenant by the grantee as owner of the vacant tract that neither he nor his heirs or assigns would \u201cerect any building\u201d on the vacant tract, in order to preserve the view of the river from the commercial building on the improved tract. The grantee intended to use the vacant tract as a nature preserve. The grantee promptly and properly recorded the deed. Last year, the businesswoman conveyed the improved tract to a businessman.

The businessman objected and sued to enjoin construction of the building. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The businessman, because the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project.\nB.

A neighbor who owned the property immediately adjacent to the land wrongfully began to possess the land at that time. For 24 of the next 25 years, the neighbor planted and harvested crops on the land, hunted on it, and parked cars on it. However, in the sixth year after he first took possession of the land, the neighbor neither planted crops nor hunted nor parked cars on the land because he spent that entire year living in Europe. The neighbor built a small gardening shed on the land, but he never built a residence on it. When the daughter was 28, she was declared mentally incompetent and had a conservator appointed to oversee her affairs. Since then, she has continuously resided in a care facility. The applicable statute of limitations provides as follows: \u201cAn ejectment action shall be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues, but if the person entitled to bring the cause of action is under age 18 or mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues, it may be brought by such person within 10 years after attaining age 18 or after the person becomes competent.\u201d If the daughter\u2019s conservator wins an ejectment action against the neighbor, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The buyer purchased a title insurance policy running to both the buyer and the bank, showing no liens on the property other than the buyer\u2019s mortgage to the bank. Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances.

If the woman's use of her house as a court-reporting service commenced prior to the enactment of the ordinance, then it would be considered a non-conforming use and would be allowed to continue for the amortization period. C is incorrect. The doctrine of change of circumstances applies to zoning ordinances that impose height, area, or setback restrictions. A change of circumstances (such as the presence of a new public street) may justify a variance from the restrictions imposed by the ordinance. D is correct. The woman's use of her house as a court-reporting service is a nonconforming use. The woman's use of her house as a court-reporting service commenced prior to the enactment of the ordinance, so it is a nonconforming use and is allowed to continue for the amortization period."

For two years in a row after the woman died, the county assessor sent the tax bills to the niece, but the niece did not pay the bills, because she and the husband could not agree on who should pay them. Finally, the niece paid the taxes to avoid a tax foreclosure sale. The niece then sued the husband for reimbursement for the two years\u2019 worth of property taxes. There is no applicable statute. Is the niece likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because remaindermen are solely responsible for the payment of property taxes.\nB.

Several years later, she executed a mortgage on the lot to a bank to secure repayment of a $100,000 loan. Subsequently, the woman executed a mortgage on the same four-acre lot to a finance company to secure repayment of a $50,000 loan. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. The woman recently defaulted on both loans. The bank promptly initiated foreclosure proceedings and sent proper notice to all necessary parties. The current fair market value of the four-acre lot is $250,000. The finance company has filed a timely motion in the foreclosure proceeding asking the court to require the bank to first foreclose on two of the four acres in the four-acre lot. The bank opposes this motion and insists that it has the right to subject the entire four-acre lot to the foreclosure sale. Will the court grant the finance company\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the bank holds a purchase-money mortgage.\nB. No, because the entire four-acre lot is subject to the bank\u2019s senior mortgage.\nC. Yes, because a pro rata foreclosure of the lot will not prejudice the rights of the bank.\nD.

            "explanation": "C is correct. This question requires you to distinguish between the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) and the doctrine of equitable conversion. The RAP applies to three types of interests: 1) vested remainders subject to open; 2) contingent remainders; and 3) executory interests. A vested remainder is a remainder that is subject to a life in being plus a determinable period of time. A contingent remainder is a remainder subject to an event that has not occurred. An executory interest is an interest that is subject to some condition that has not been satisfied. The RAP dictates that where any of these interests would vest outside of a life in being plus 21 years, it is void. The doctrine of equitable conversion, on the other hand, allows the court to convert an executory interest to a vested remainder subject to the life in being plus 21 year rule where the interest would otherwise be void under the RAP. Paragraph 6 of the seller\u2019s will is a contingent remainder. The seller\u2019s interest in the real property would vest upon the death of the seller\u2019s son, who was the beneficiary of Paragraph 5. However, because the seller died before the interest would have vested, the interest is void under the RAP. The doctrine of equitable conversion allows the court to convert the contingent remainder to a vested remainder, so that the seller\u2019s daughter, the beneficiary of Paragraph 6, receives the proceeds of the sale. A is incorrect because whether the interest is a specific or general grant of real property is irrelevant for purposes of the RAP. B is incorrect because whether the closing date was before or after the seller\u2019s death has no bearing on whether the interest would have vested before the seller\u2019s death. D is incorrect because there is no evidence that the sale of the real property was subject to any court order."

The university is accredited by the department of education of the state in which it is located. This accreditation certifies that the university meets prescribed educational standards. Because it is accredited, the university qualifies for state funding for certain of its operating expenses. Under this funding program, 25 percent of the university\u2019s total operating budget comes from state funds. A professor at the university was a part-time columnist for the local newspaper. In one of her published columns, the professor argued that \u201creligion has become a negative force in society.\u201d The university subsequently discharged the professor, giving as its sole reason for the dismissal her authorship and publication of this column. The professor sued the university, claiming only that her discharge violated her constitutional right to freedom of speech.

The protections afforded by the First Amendment against the state are not extended to the actions of a state-accredited institution, such as a private university, if those actions are not attributable to the state. In this case, the state has not directly intervened in the employment relationship between the university and the professor. Therefore, the court should grant the university's motion to dismiss. A is incorrect. This answer invokes the \"viewpoint neutrality\" requirement of the First Amendment, which prohibits the state from restricting freedom of speech based on the viewpoint of the speaker. However, the professor is not asserting that the state has violated the \"viewpoint neutrality\" requirement; rather, she is asserting that the state has violated her freedom of speech, which is not a right enumerated in the Constitution. Thus, the protections of the First Amendment are not applicable to this case. C is incorrect. This answer incorrectly asserts that the protections of the First Amendment are applicable to this case. D is incorrect. This answer incorrectly asserts that the protections of the First Amendment are applicable to this case. In addition, the court would not find that the state was an active participant in the discharge of the professor simply because it accredited the university and partially funded it.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA city ordinance prohibited individuals from picketing in residential neighborhoods unless the picketing related to the neighborhood zoning requirements.

A state may enact laws that impose restrictions on commercial activity that protect a compelling state interest, even if those restrictions impose a burden on interstate commercial activity. B is incorrect because groundwater located within a state is an article of interstate commerce.

The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAn engineer entered into a written contract with an owner to serve in the essential position of on-site supervisor for construction of an office building. The day after signing the contract, the engineer was injured while bicycling and was rendered physically incapable of performing as the on-site supervisor. The engineer offered to serve as an off-site consultant for the same pay as originally agreed to by the parties. Is the owner likely to prevail in an action against the engineer for damages resulting from his failure to perform under the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the engineer offered a reasonable substitute by offering to serve as an off-site consultant.\nB. No, because the engineer\u2019s physical ability to perform as on-site supervisor was a basic assumption of the contract.\nC.

Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one party's performance requires a period of time to complete, that party's duty, to the extent practicable, is conditioned on the other party's substantial performance. Thus, if the engineer had substantially performed his duty, he would have a right to expect the owner to perform his duty, which in this case was to pay for the engineer's services. As soon as the engineer offered to serve as an off-site consultant, the owner was obligated to waive the non-occurrence of the condition--that is, the engineer's personal presence on the job site--and to allow the engineer to perform his contractual duty by serving as an off-site consultant. Because the engineer offered a reasonable substitute by offering to serve as an off-site consultant, the owner is unlikely to prevail in an action for breach of contract. B is incorrect. While the engineer's physical ability to perform as on-site supervisor may have been a basic assumption of the contract, the engineer was not obligated to personally perform under the contract. Instead, the engineer was only obligated to use reasonable efforts to perform under the contract. As long as the engineer used reasonable efforts to perform, he would not be in breach.

Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one performance will take a period of time to complete while the other can be completed in an instant, completion of the longer-term performance is made conditional on the other party's performance. In this case, the rancher's obligation to harvest the wheat is made conditional on the neighbor's obligation to provide the ripe wheat. If the neighbor had not expressly made performance of the contract conditional, the rancher still would be liable for the neighbor's loss under the doctrine of constructive conditions. A is incorrect. Time for performance is implied unless the contract specifies otherwise. In this case, however, the contract is silent with respect to time for performance, so the default rule is that there is no time limit on performance. B is incorrect. The neighbor did not breach the contract by not telling the rancher that the crop might be destroyed by a hailstorm. It was not within the neighbor's control to prevent the hailstorm. D is incorrect.

The bookstore business, which was housed in a building that the aunt leased, was independently appraised at $200,000. The aunt decided to retire. She wrote to the niece, expressing her affection for the niece and offering to sell her the bookstore business for $125,000 if the landlord would agree to a transfer of the lease. The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt\u2019s offer. In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms. Before the attorney had finished drafting the document, the aunt changed her mind about selling the business and informed the niece of her decision. In an action for breach of contract brought by the niece against her aunt, is the niece likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The niece's reliance on her aunt's promise to sell the business would be valid, regardless of whether the aunt's motivation for making the promise was to express her affection for the niece. Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, a promise that is made with intent to be performed, but is not in fact performed, may be enforceable if the promisor should reasonably have expected the promise to be relied upon by the promisee. Because the aunt had expressed her intention to sell the business to the niece and the niece had relied on that promise, the niece is likely to prevail. B is incorrect. The market value of the business is not the only consideration that could lead a court to find that the aunt breached the contract. As stated above, the niece is likely to prevail because she relied on the aunt's promise to sell the business. C is incorrect. Even if the landlord's assent to the transfer of the lease had been a necessary condition to the aunt's duty to perform under the contract, the aunt would still be liable for breach of contract. By promising to convey the business to the niece, the aunt had already accepted the niece's offer to purchase the business. Once the aunt had accepted the niece's offer, she was obligated to perform, regardless of whether the landlord assented to the transfer of the lease. D is correct. The document being drafted by the attorney was an acceptance of the niece's offer to purchase the business. As such, it did not itself impose any obligation on the aunt; it merely accepted the aunt's offer to sell the business.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Under the Federal Arbitration Act, arbitration is strictly construed, and any waiver of a right to arbitrate must be explicit. Therefore, if a party seeks to arbitrate a dispute that the non-signing party did not agree to arbitrate, the party seeking arbitration must show that the other party waived its right to litigation. Because the buyer did not expressly agree to arbitrate the dispute, the seller must show that the waiver of litigation was explicit. A is incorrect because, while arbitration may be a more efficient method of resolving disputes, it is not a sufficient reason to find that the buyer waived its right to litigation. B is incorrect because the provision for arbitration did contradict the buyer\u2019s offer in that it required the buyer to submit a dispute to arbitration, rather than allowing the parties to litigate the dispute in court. D is incorrect because the seller\u2019s acknowledgment did not constitute a counteroffer that was accepted by the buyer. Acknowledgments are not offers that can be accepted by the other party."

Under UCC \u00a7 2-207(2), an additional term is considered a proposal for addition to the contract. Section 2-207(2) also provides that an additional term becomes a term of the parties\u2019 contract unless certain specified circumstances are present. One such circumstance is where an additional term materially alters the parties\u2019 contract. Because none of the other circumstances appear applicable here, the arbitration provision will be considered a term of the contract if the seller can successfully argue that the provision did not materially alter the parties\u2019 contract.",

The janitorial service is liable to the patient as a matter of public policy, because it violated the city\u2019s health code.\nB. The patient is an intended third-party beneficiary under the contract, because the janitorial service\u2019s promise was\nintended to benefit all hospital patients.\nC.

Under the doctrine of incidental beneficiary, a party who is not a contractual party under the terms of a contract may still have a claim based on that contract if the other party\u2019s performance would have a practical benefit for the third party. However, the incidental beneficiary is not entitled to damages; rather, the incidental beneficiary is only entitled to equitable remedies. Because the patient is an incidental beneficiary of the janitorial service contract, she is entitled to equitable remedies, such as specific performance, but she is not entitled to damages. A is incorrect. While the janitorial service\u2019s failure to clean the patient\u2019s room may constitute a violation of the city\u2019s health code, this fact does not mean that the janitorial service is liable to the patient as a matter of public policy.

The developer told the buyer that the lot abutted a national park and that the water for the house came from a natural artesian spring. The developer knew that both of these representations were important to the buyer and that both were false. The buyer moved into the house and eight months later learned that a private golf course was being constructed on the adjacent land and that the water for his house was piped in from the city reservoir. The buyer immediately sued the developer to avoid the contract. The construction of the golf course will probably increase the market value of the buyer\u2019s property, and the water from the city reservoir exceeds all established standards for drinking water. Is the buyer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because eight months exceeds a reasonable time for contract avoidance.\nB.

Under the statute of frauds, the contract is unenforceable by the developer, and the buyer is free to avoid the contract. A is incorrect. The statute of frauds does not impose a time limit within which a party must avoid a contract that falls within its provisions. B is incorrect. Under the statute of frauds, the contract is unenforceable by the developer, and the buyer is free to avoid the contract. As such, the developer's misstatements regarding the lot and water will have no impact on whether the buyer is able to avoid the contract. C is incorrect.

After the parties had performed under the agreement for three months, the supplier notified the company that it would no longer give the company the 10% discount off the published prices. Does the company have a viable claim against the supplier for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because part performance of the agreement by both parties made it enforceable for the full year.\nB. Yes, because the company\u2019s agreement to buy all of its lawn care products from the supplier made the agreement\nenforceable.\nC.

Three months later, the retail outlet sold the service portion of its business to an experienced and well-financed computer service company. The only provision in the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company relating to the outlet\u2019s contract with the bank stated that the outlet \u201chereby assigns all of its computer service contracts to [the computer service company].\u201d The computer service company performed the monthly maintenance required under the service contract. Its performance was defective, however, and caused damage to the bank\u2019s operations. Whom can the bank sue for damages arising from the computer service company\u2019s defective performance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The retail outlet only, because the computer service company made no promises to the bank.\nB. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because the bank has not released the outlet and the bank is\nan intended beneficiary of the outlet\u2019s agreement with the computer service company.\nC. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because since each has the right to enforce the bank\u2019s\nperformance of its contract with the retail outlet, mutuality of remedy renders either potentially liable for the defective\nperformance.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The bank is an intended beneficiary of the outlet-computer service company contract. Under the doctrine of irrevocable waiver, a party who has been accidentally or constructively discharged under a contract is treated as if never discharged. Therefore, the bank is considered a party to the outlet-computer service company contract even though the computer service company performed for the bank without the outlet\u2019s knowledge or consent. As an intended beneficiary of the outlet-computer service company contract, the bank has the right to sue either the retail outlet or the computer service company for damages arising from the computer service company\u2019s defective performance. A is incorrect. The bank can sue the retail outlet as well as the computer service company because the outlet assigned its rights and duties under the contract to the computer service company. The computer service company is liable for its own negligent performance, not the retail outlet\u2019s. C is incorrect. mutuality of remedy does not make both parties jointly liable for the other\u2019s negligent performance. Instead, it means that the remedies available to enforce the contract are the same for both parties. For example, if one party breached the contract by failing to deliver goods, the other party could either sue for breach or demand performance. Under the facts of this problem, if the computer service company breached the contract by failing to perform, the bank could either sue the computer service company for breach or demand performance. D is incorrect. The computer service company\u2019s qualifications and financial responsibility are irrelevant if the computer service company did not breach the contract."

However, absent consent by the obligee (the bank) or performance by the delegate (the computer service company), an effective delegation does not relieve the delegating party (the retail outlet) of its duty to the obligee. When the computer service company purchased the service contracts, the bank also became an intended beneficiary of the computer service company\u2019s promise to the retail outlet. The computer service company expressly agreed with the retail outlet to perform the outlet\u2019s obligation to the bank, making the bank an intended beneficiary of that obligation.

No, because the offered evidence is inconsistent with the express language of the agreement.\nB. No, because the written contract was totally integrated.\nC.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The court should overrule the objection and deny the request for a limiting instruction.\nC. The court should overrule the objection and give the limiting instruction.\nD.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

The executive did take possession of the items, but she did not have the owner's consent to take the items and she did not intend to permanently deprive the owner of the items. To commit burglary, a person must enter a building of another with the intent to commit a crime therein. The building need not be owned by the person. The executive entered the building with the intent to commit a crime therein, so she committed burglary. A is incorrect. Larceny is the taking possession of, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the item, of the personal property of another.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

            "explanation": "A is correct. Although the man\u2019s action in breaking the television set probably would be considered assault, under the facts of this case, it is clear that the man intended to kill the friend. That intent, combined with the use of a deadly weapon, a hammer, and the fact that the friend was not a participant in the earlier altercation, all indicate that the man is guilty of murder. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. The man\u2019s actions in breaking the television set and his statement that he intended to kill the friend demonstrate that he had malice aforethought necessary for a murder conviction. Under the facts, B is incorrect. While it is true that the man could properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter, under the facts of this case, a jury would not likely find that the man killed the friend with malice. To be convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the man must have killed the friend with malice, but the man\u2019s actions in breaking the television set and his statement that he intended to kill the friend demonstrate that he had malice aforethought necessary for a murder conviction. As such, a jury would not likely find that the man killed the friend with malice and, as a result, B is incorrect. While it is true that the man could properly be convicted of involuntary manslaughter, under the facts of this case, a jury would not likely find that the man killed the friend with malice. To be convicted of involuntary manslaughter, the man must have killed the friend without malice aforethought, but the man\u2019s actions in breaking the television set and his statement that he intended to kill the friend demonstrate that he had malice aforethought necessary for a murder conviction. As such, a jury would not likely find that the man killed the friend with malice and, as a result, C is incorrect. While it is true that the man could properly be convicted of assault, under the facts of this case, a jury would not likely find that the man intended to kill the friend. To be convicted of assault, the man must have intended to commit a violent injury upon the friend, but the man\u2019s statement that he intended to hit the friend with the hammer demonstrates that he did not have the intent necessary for an assault conviction. As such, D is incorrect."

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nFederal agents had a hunch that a local man was engaged in illegal gambling activities. An agent decided to enter the man\u2019s house while he was not at home and see what he could find. The agent discovered an envelope containing $5,000 in cash and an executive\u2019s business card. Returning the envelope to its place, the agent located and interviewed the executive, who admitted that he had paid the man $5,000 to settle a gambling debt; the executive also disclosed that the man regularly took illegal bets from the executive and several of his acquaintances. The agent then interviewed the acquaintances, who confirmed what the executive had told him. The agent then arranged to be introduced to the man at a local bar. After a few drinks, the man, unaware of the agent\u2019s identity, boasted that he was one of the biggest bookmakers in the state. The agent testified to all of his investigation\u2019s discoveries before a grand jury, which returned an indictment against the man for illegal gambling activities, based solely on the agent\u2019s testimony. The man\u2019s attorney then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it rested on violations of the man\u2019s constitutional rights. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because dismissal of the indictment is not the appropriate remedy.\nB. Yes, because much of the agent\u2019s testimony before the grand jury was inadmissible hearsay.\nC. Yes, because of the agent\u2019s unlawful search of the man\u2019s home.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The man's attorney is making a claim of \"materiality,\" alleging that the indictment should be dismissed because the underlying investigation violated the man's constitutional rights. To warrant dismissal of the indictment, the man's claim must be that the agent's violation of his rights rendered the indictment \"materially\" prejudicial to him. Because the alleged violations are ones that could lead to the suppression of evidence, the man's claim is that any error would have led to the dismissal of the indictment. Thus, if the alleged violations resulted in the introduction of inadmissible evidence, then the indictment should be dismissed. Here, the man's claim is that the indictment should be dismissed because much of the agent's testimony before the grand jury was inadmissible hearsay. Thus, A is incorrect. Dismissal of the indictment is the appropriate remedy for the man's claim. C is incorrect. The man's claim is that the indictment should be dismissed because the agent violated his constitutional rights. Thus, even if there had been no unlawful search, the indictment still would have to be dismissed. Thus, D is incorrect. The man's claim is that the indictment should be dismissed because the agent violated his constitutional rights. Thus, the court should grant the man's motion to dismiss the indictment."

            "explanation": "B is correct. The girlfriend is guilty of burglary, but not guilty of larceny. Larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. The girlfriend's taking possession of the mower is the taking of personal property, and she did so without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner. However, she is not guilty of larceny because she did not take the mower with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. Instead, she took the mower to mow her own lawn, so she is only guilty of attempted larceny. Attempted larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, but being prevented by some circumstance from obtaining possession of the property. In this case, the man prevented the girlfriend from obtaining possession of the mower by mowing with it. Thus, the girlfriend is guilty of attempted larceny, but not guilty of larceny. As for burglary, the man and the girlfriend are both guilty of burglary. Burglary is the breaking and entering into a structure or building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein. The man and the girlfriend broke and entered into the neighbor's shed with the intent to steal the mower, so they are both guilty of burglary."

The defendant did not testify, but his sister did. She testified that on March 5, at the time of the robbery, the defendant was with her in a city 300 miles away. On cross-examination, the sister admitted having given a statement to the police in which she had said that the defendant was not with her on March 5, but she claimed that the earlier statement was mistaken.

As to the defendant\u2019s claim of alibi, which of the following additional instructions would be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nPolice responded to a call that shots had been heard coming from a certain house. Upon arriving at the house, the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious. An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine. After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana. The young woman has filed a motion to suppress the use of both as evidence on the ground that the entry into the house and the searches were made without a warrant. How should the court decide the young woman\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Grant it as to the cocaine, but deny it as to the marijuana.\nB. Deny it as to the cocaine, but grant it as to the marijuana.\nC. Grant it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nD. Deny it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "C is correct. The police had probable cause to enter the house and conduct a search for weapons and suspects, so the warrantless entry and search would be constitutional if the exception to the warrant requirement under the \"hot pursuit\" case law were applicable. However, the pursuit of the suspect in this case did not justify a warrantless entry. Because the police did not have a warrant, they could not seize property without a warrant, even if they believed it would be incriminating evidence. Thus, A is incorrect. Under the facts of this case, the cocaine would have to be suppressed. B is incorrect. The marijuana would have to be suppressed under this scenario. D is incorrect. The drugs would have to be suppressed."

Once they were inside the home, the police officers could properly seize contraband in plain view but could not conduct an exploratory search for contraband.
