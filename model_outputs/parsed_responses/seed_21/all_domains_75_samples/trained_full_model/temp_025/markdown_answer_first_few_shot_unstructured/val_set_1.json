The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn January, a teacher contracted with a summer camp to serve as its head counselor at a salary of $10,000 for 10 weeks of service from the first of June to the middle of August. In March, the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed. In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for that job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period as the summer camp. In a breach-of-contract action against the camp, to which of the following amounts, as damages, is the teacher entitled?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $4,000.\nB. $4,200.\nC. $10,000.\nD. $10,200.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Under the doctrine of mitigation of damages, a breaching party is only liable for the difference between the contractual damages and the amount the nonbreaching party receives as a result of the breach. In this case, the teacher received $6,000 for teaching in the summer school, which is $4,000 less than the $10,000 he would have received from the camp. Thus, B is correct and A is incorrect. A is simply the amount the teacher lost in salary, and does not take into account the fact that the teacher took other steps to mitigate his damages. C is incorrect. This is simply a mistake. The teacher is entitled to $4,000, not $10,000. D is incorrect. This is simply a mistake. The teacher is entitled to $4,000, not $10,200."

The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier wrote the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed its latest audited financial statements to the supplier, as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the lumber supplier for breach of contract. Will the manufacturer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contract was unenforceable, since the manufacturer had not committed to purchase a definite quantity\nof lumber.\nB. No, because the supplier had reasonable grounds for insecurity and was therefore entitled to cancel the contract and\nrefuse to make any future deliveries.\nC. Yes, because the credit report and audited financial statements provided adequate assurance of due performance under\nthe contract.\nD.

Later, while construction was proceeding, the landowner and the contractor entered into an oral modification under which the contractor was not obligated to pave the sidewalk, but still would be entitled to $200,000 upon completion. The contractor completed the building. The landowner, after discussions with his landscaper, demanded that the contractor pave the adjacent sidewalk. The contractor refused. Has the contractor breached the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the oral modification was in good faith and therefore enforceable.\nB.

Under the parol evidence rule, a promise made during the negotiations for a contract may be considered in order to explain what the parties meant by the terms of the contract. However, a promise made after the contract has been executed is not enforceable under the parol evidence rule. B is incorrect. Under the parol evidence rule, a promise made after the contract has been executed is not enforceable. Therefore, if the contractor had not already paved the sidewalk when the landowner orally modified the contract, his promise to do so would not be enforceable under the parol evidence rule. C is incorrect. The parol evidence rule bars proof of the landowner's promise to the contractor to pave the sidewalk, not the contractor's promise to the landowner. D is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the contractor's promise to pave the sidewalk is unenforceable, but it is incorrect in stating that there was no consideration for the landowner's promise to the contractor. Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, the landowner's promise to pave the sidewalk may be enforceable, even absent an exchange of consideration."

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

One week after the chef was hired by the bakery, a hotel offered the chef a position as a restaurant manager at a salary of $2,500 a month. The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery.

No, because a contract for permanent employment would be interpreted to mean the chef could leave at any time.\nB. No, because the position the chef took with the hotel was not substantially comparable to the one she had agreed to\ntake with the bakery.\nC. Yes, because the chef's acceptance of a permanent position meant that she agreed to leave the bakery only after a\nreasonable time.\nD.

C is incorrect. The tutor made no promise to the son. The tutor made a promise to the mother, and the mother and the son are jointly entitled to the benefit of that promise. However, as stated above, the son could have avoided the consequences of the tutor's breach by employing another equally qualified instructor, so that nominal damages, rather than real damages, are the appropriate remedy. B is incorrect. Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, the tutor is estopped to deny that the promise was made, but this estoppel does not extend to damages that the son could have avoided by taking alternative steps. As stated above, the son could have avoided the consequences of the tutor's breach by employing another equally qualified instructor, so that nominal damages, rather than real damages, are the appropriate remedy."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

Each structure was distinct from the other two and the parties agreed on a specific price for each. After completing the first structure in accordance with the terms of the contract, the builder demanded payment of the specified price for that structure. At the same time, the builder told the landowner that the builder was \"tired of the construction business\" and would not even begin the other two structures. The landowner refused to pay anything to the builder. Is the builder likely to prevail in a suit for the agreed price of the first structure?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because substantial performance is a constructive condition to the landowner's duty to pay at the contract rate.\nB. No, because the builder's cessation of performance without legal excuse is a willful breach of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the contract is divisible, and the landowner will be required to bring a separate claim for the builder's\nfailure to complete the other two structures.\nD.

At the nephew's suggestion, the uncle then telephoned the nephew's mother, told her about the loan, and asked if she would \"guarantee\" it. She replied, \"Surely.

The statute of frauds mandates that any contract for the sale of land or for the sale of an interest in land must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute.

One of those exceptions allows parties to contract for the sale of goods without a writing if the contract is for the sale of less than $5,000. Thus, A is incorrect. The sale of the $4,000 loan does not fall within the statute of frauds's writing requirement because the sale of the loan is for less than $5,000. C is incorrect. Even though the sale of the loan does not fall within the writing requirement of the statute of frauds, the contract still must meet the signing requirement of the statute. The party to be charged with the contract must sign the contract.

Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one performance will take a period of time to complete while the other can be completed in an instant, completion of the longer-term performance is made conditional upon the other party's having completed their performance.

The parol evidence rule bars evidence of an express condition to avoid forfeiture unless the condition is a material term of the agreement. In this case, the interest rate term is a material term of the agreement and, therefore, the parol evidence rule would allow evidence of the express condition to avoid forfeiture.

On May 29, relying on his expectation that he would finish the work and have the homeowner's payment on June 1, the carpenter contracted to buy a car for \"$10,000 in cash, if payment is made on June 1; if payment is made thereafter, the price is $12,000.\" The carpenter completed the work according to specifications on June 1 and demanded payment from the homeowner on that date. The homeowner, without any excuse, refused to pay. Thereupon, the carpenter became very excited, suffered a minor heart attack, and, as a result, incurred medical expenses of $1,000. The reasonable value of the carpenter's services in remodeling the homeowner's home was $13,000. In an action by the carpenter against the homeowner, which of the following should be the carpenter's measure of recovery?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $10,000, the contract price.\nB. $11,000, the contract price plus $1,000 for the medical expenses incurred because the homeowner refused to pay.\nC. $12,000, the contract price plus $2,000, the bargain that was lost because the carpenter could not pay cash for the car\non June 1.\nD. $13,000, the amount the homeowner was enriched by the carpenter's services.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside Green, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in Green. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in Green. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in Green. The Green legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of Green from faulty science and to protect Green toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in Green of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in Green satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the Green law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it abrogates the obligations of the contracts between the other toy manufacturers and their Green outlets\nwho have agreed to sell their Martian toys.\nB. No, because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because it deals only with a local matter, the sale of toys in Green stores.\nD.

A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

While Congress has the power to delegate rule-making authority to federal agencies through statutes, any such delegation of power is subject to several limitations. First, the statute must provide an \"intelligible principle\" that will guide the agency's exercise of its delegated power. Second, the statute must provide for notice and an opportunity for comment before the agency may issue a rule. Third, the statute must provide that the agency's rule may become effective only after the agency publishes the rule in the Federal Register. The statute here provides for the delegation of rule-making authority to the Forest Service, and it does provide an intelligible principle that will guide the agency's exercise of its delegated power. Thus, A is incorrect. The executive branch, in general, does not have inherent rule-making authority. But, as stated above, Congress may delegate rule-making authority to federal agencies through statute. Thus, C is incorrect. There is no indication that the rule is necessary to advance a compelling governmental interest. D is incorrect. This is incorrect because even if law enforcement were considered an executive function, the rule-making power is not an executive function, and hence it would still need specific congressional authorization."

Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was \"to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats\" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser sued the county, claiming that the regulation has taken the purchaser's property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the county did not take title to the property from the purchaser.\nB. No, because the regulation has not caused or authorized any uninvited physical invasion or intrusion onto the property.\nC.

The facts clearly indicate that the zoning ordinance has substantially reduced the value of the property and denied the owner all economically beneficial use of the property. The issue is whether the ordinance constitutes a taking. For a zoning ordinance to constitute a taking, it must: 1) substantially reduce the value of the property, and 2) deny all economically beneficial use of the property. Because the county ordinance has substantially reduced the value of the property and denied all economically beneficial use of the property, the court will rule in favor of the purchaser. A is incorrect. The fact that the county did not take title to the property is irrelevant. What is important is whether the ordinance has substantially reduced the value of the property and denied all economically beneficial use of the property. B is incorrect. While a physical invasion or intrusion is not necessary for there to be a taking, it is still important to analyze whether there has been one. Here, the county's ordinance has substantially reduced the value of the property and denied all economically beneficial use of the property. Therefore, the court will rule in favor of the purchaser.

Such a procedure must allow a court to approve an abortion for a minor without parental notification if the court finds: (1) the minor is sufficiently mature and informed to make an independent decision to obtain an abortion; or (2) the abortion would be in the minor's best interest. Because no such bypass procedure is included in the statute at issue, the court will hold the statute unconstitutional."

The statute also provided that public proceedings must precede adoption of the standards, and that once they were adopted, the standards would be subject to judicial review. No standards have yet been adopted. Several officials of the National Bureau of Standards have indicated their personal preference for beer produced by a special brewing process commonly referred to as pasteurization. However, these officials have not indicated whether they intend to include a requirement for pasteurization in the minimum beer quality standards to be adopted by the Bureau. A brewery that produces an unpasteurized beer believes that its brewing process is as safe as pasteurization. The brewery is concerned that, after the appropriate proceedings, the Bureau may adopt quality standards that will prohibit the sale of any unpasteurized beer. As a result, the brewery sued in federal district court to enjoin the Bureau from adopting any standards that would prohibit the sale of unpasteurized beer in this country. How should the district court dispose of the suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state. When it adopted the law, the state legislature declared that its purpose was to reduce the risks of infection of local citrus crops by itinerant diseases that have been found to attack citrus fruit. A national association of citrus growers sued to have the state law declared unconstitutional.

The fact that the man's communication was racially motivated does not make the communication itself unconstitutional. The man could be convicted under this law, but only if the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest."

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice.\nB. No, because murder is a specific intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that they intended to kill.\nC. Yes, because the gang members made no effort to save the informant after he had been stabbed.\nD. Yes, because voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant was charged with manslaughter. At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate dismissed the charge on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient. The prosecutor then brought the case before a grand jury. After hearing the evidence presented by the prosecutor, the grand jury refused to return an indictment. The prosecutor waited a few months until a new grand jury had been impaneled and brought the case before that grand jury, which returned an indictment charging the defendant with manslaughter. The defendant moves to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. Should the motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because jeopardy had not attached.\nB. No, because there has been no conviction or acquittal.\nC. Yes, because any proceeding after the preliminary hearing would violate double jeopardy.\nD. Yes, because bringing the case before the second grand jury was a violation of double jeopardy.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the license number of the driver's car. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her and the car, and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat of the car. Later it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding. The driver was charged with unlawful possession of heroin. Her attorney filed a motion to suppress the use as evidence of the heroin found in the car.

She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny it as to all photographs.\nB.

The fact that the woman did not intend to permanently deprive the clerk of his property (she planned to return the money) does not make the taking any less larcenous. Under the common law, larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. At common law, larceny is a specific intent crime, and the fact that the woman did not intend to permanently keep the money does not mean she did not have the intent to commit larceny. A is incorrect. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of another person's property by someone who had lawful possession of said property. The woman did not have lawful possession of the clerk's property, and she did not convert it, so she cannot be convicted of embezzlement. B is incorrect. Obtaining property by false pretenses is obtaining the possession of property of another by fraud. The woman did obtain possession of the clerk's property, but she did not obtain it by fraud. To be convicted of obtaining property by false pretenses, the defendant must obtain the property by a false pretenses, and the false pretenses must be fraudulent. The woman's claim that the man across the street had a rifle and could see everything the clerk did was false, so it was a misrepresentation, and it was done with the intent to obtain the clerk's property, so it is false pretenses. However, it was not obtained by fraud, because there was no intent to deceive the clerk. C is incorrect. Robbery is the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. Larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property.

The clerk agreed, saying, \"I know I can trust someone like you with the merchandise.\" The customer walked out of the store wearing the watch and never returned. A week later, the clerk was at a gathering when she spotted the customer wearing the watch. She told him that he must either pay for the watch or give it back. He hissed, \"I'll knock your block off if you mess with me.\" Intimidated, the clerk backed off. The following list of crimes is in descending order of seriousness.

The customer committed larceny, which is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. The fact that the customer did not pay for the watch and did not have the owner's permission to take it, and that he kept possession of it for more than a few hours, all are indicative of the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the watch. The other answers are in incorrect descending order of seriousness. A is incorrect. Robbery is the taking of personal property of another from the person of the other by force or intimidation with the intent to permanently deprive him of said property. There was no force or threat of force used by the customer, nor was the taking from the person of the clerk. B is incorrect. Larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. As stated above, the customer committed larceny. C is incorrect. False pretenses is obtaining the possession of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. The customer obtained possession of the watch through fraud, but he did not do so with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property.

Six months ago, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestate, survived by a daughter as his sole heir at law. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him. As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land. For whom should the court hold?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter, because the death of the landowner deprived the subsequent recordation of any effect.\nB. The daughter, because the friend was dishonest in reporting that he had destroyed the deed.\nC. The friend, because the deed was delivered to him.\nD.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The words \"This is yours\" indicate that the landowner had completed the process of conveyance by deed and that the friend was the owner of the deed. The only requirements that must be satisfied for a conveyance of land by deed to be valid are execution and delivery of the deed. Delivery is effected by proving intent to pass title, even if the transferor never physically gives the title document to the transferee. The friend's acceptance of the deed, along with the landowner's statement that the deed was his, and that he wanted the friend to record it, are sufficient evidence of intent to pass title, and C is the best answer. A is incorrect. The death of the landowner does not affect the validity of the deed, unless the landowner had a life estate in the land, in which case the deed would be a mortgage. B is incorrect. The friend's misrepresentation regarding the deed does not affect the validity of the deed. Recording the deed did not require that the friend be truthful about destroying the deed. D is incorrect. While recording the deed did, in fact, complete the transfer of title, the friend was the owner of the deed prior to recording it and thus was the owner of the land at the time of the landowner's death."

Subsequently, the church wanted to relocate and entered into a valid written contract to sell the land to a buyer for a substantial price.

Two years later, the debtor purchased land in the county and promptly and properly recorded the warranty deed to it. Subsequently, the debtor borrowed $30,000 from his aunt, signing a promissory note for that amount, which note was secured by a mortgage on the land. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The aunt failed to make a title search before making the loan. The debtor made no payment to the creditor and defaulted on the mortgage loan from his aunt. A valid judicial foreclosure proceeding was held, in which the creditor, the aunt, and the debtor were named parties. A dispute arose as to which lien has priority.

The investor made the installment payments on the mortgage regularly for several years. Then the investor persuaded a neighbor to buy the land, subject to the mortgage to his partner. They expressly agreed that the neighbor would not assume and agree to pay the investor's debt to the partner. The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating in pertinent part \" . . . , subject to a mortgage to [the partner],\" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage. The neighbor took possession of the land and made several mortgage payments, which the partner accepted. Now, however, neither the neighbor nor the investor has made the last three mortgage payments.

For the past nine years, the rancher has impounded on her land the water that resulted from rain and melting snow, much of which flowed from the farmer's land. The rancher uses the water in her livestock operation. Recently, the farmer increased the size of his farming operation and built a dam on his land near the boundary between the two tracts. Because of the dam, these waters no longer drain from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. There is no applicable statute. The rancher sued the farmer to restrain him from interfering with the natural flow of the water onto her land. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The farmer, because he has the right to use all of the water impounded on his land.\nB. The farmer, because the rancher's past impoundment of water estops her from asserting the illegality of the farmer's\ndam.\nC. The rancher, because she has acquired riparian rights to use the water.\nD. The rancher, because the farmer is estopped to claim all of the surface water on his land.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A is correct. While this situation may seem like a landowners' version of the Gulf Stream case, there are significant differences. First, the facts clearly indicate that the rancher is impounding the water for her own use. Second, there is no evidence that the farmer has interfered with the rancher's use of the water in the past, or that the rancher has been aware of the farmer's dam. For these reasons, A is correct. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that A is correct, but it adds an additional comment that is incorrect. While it is true that the farmer can use all of the water impounded on his land, he cannot interfere with the rancher's use of the water by impoundment on her land. For this reason, B is incorrect. C is incorrect. Riparian rights allow a landowner to use the water in a stream or river adjacent to her land, but they do not give the owner the right to use all of the water on her land. For this reason, C is incorrect. D is incorrect. This answer correctly states that A is correct, but it adds an additional comment that is incorrect. The farmer cannot claim estoppel with regard to the rancher's use of the water, because the farmer has not interfered with the rancher's use of the water in the past, and the rancher has no awareness of the farmer's dam. For this reason, D is incorrect."

The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance. How should the $200,000 surplus arising from the bid on the parking garage be distributed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It should be paid to the bank.\nB. It should be paid to the businessman.\nC.

Likewise, if the court were to award the $200,000 to the financing company, it would be penalizing the bank for the financing company's failure to get a better price for the parking garage. C is the only answer that appropriately distributes the surplus and is in keeping with the banks and the financing company's respective interests. A is incorrect. The bank's interest in the surplus is not superior to the financing company's. B is incorrect. The businessman has no interest in the surplus and thus cannot be the recipient of it. D is incorrect.

(The bank may have decided on this course of action because it deemed the businessman's equity in the garage was significant and the timing was bad for a hotel foreclosure.) After the financing company was paid in full from the funds generated by the foreclosure sale of its mortgage on the parking garage, the additional funds generated by that sale would be paid to the bank not as a deficiency judgment, but because of the unsatisfied amount of the prior money judgment.",

The recorded subdivision plan imposed no restrictions on any of the 10 lots. Within two months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to a buyer, by a deed that contained no restriction on the lot's use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner, on behalf of himself as the owner of the unsold lot, and on behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on Lot 1. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The doctor, because Lot 1 was conveyed without the inclusion of the restrictive covenant in the deed to the first buyer\nand the subsequent deed to the doctor.\nB. The doctor, because zoning ordinances override private restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.\nC. The landowner, because the doctor, as a successor in interest to the first buyer, is estopped to deny that Lot 1 remains\nsubject to the zoning ordinance as it existed when Lot 1 was first conveyed by the landowner to the first buyer.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The doctor is not estopped to deny the existence of the restrictive covenant on Lot 1 because she did not represent to the landowner that she would be bound by the restrictive covenant. B is incorrect. While zoning ordinances do override private restrictive covenants, this is only the case where the restrictive covenant runs afoul of the zoning ordinance (for example, restricting use to single-family residential purposes would be permissible, but restricting use to residential purposes would not be). Since the doctor's use of the lot for professional office purposes is permissible under the zoning ordinance, the doctor is not in violation of the restrictive covenant and she is not estopped to deny that she is bound by it. C is correct. The doctor is estopped to deny that Lot 1 remains subject to the restrictive covenant because she is a successor in interest to the first buyer, who had actual knowledge of the restrictive covenant and who did not object to it. D is incorrect. The landowner's argument for why the doctor is estopped to deny the existence of the restrictive covenant on Lot 1 is that the first buyer had actual knowledge of the restrictive covenant and did not object to it, so the doctor is estopped to deny that she is bound by it. The landowner's argument for why the doctor is estopped to deny the existence of the restrictive covenant on Lot 1 is incorrect if the doctor is not a party to the original contract between the landowner and the first buyer."

The contract made no mention of the quality of title to be conveyed. Thereafter, the seller and the investor completed the sale, and the seller delivered a warranty deed to the investor. Soon thereafter, the value of the land increased dramatically. The investor entered into a written contract to sell the land to a buyer.

The homeowner's illness, combined with his handing the deed to the nephew's friend and his statement that he wanted the nephew to have the home, are clear indications that the homeowner was attempting to make a will. The only requirements for a will to be valid under the laws of the jurisdiction are that it be in writing and signed by the party making it. Since the homeowner's deed met both of those requirements, it is a valid will. As a will, the deed must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Since the homeowner is no longer alive to testify, the court will look at the surrounding circumstances to determine if it is clear and convincing that the deed is a will. Since the facts indicate that the homeowner intended to make a will, and the deed was signed and witnessed in the same manner as a deed to a home, the court will find that the deed is a will. A is incorrect. Delivery of a deed is effected by proving intent to pass title, even if the transferor never physically gives the title document to the transferee. The homeowner's statement that he wanted the nephew to have the home, combined with the fact that he handed the deed to the nephew's friend, are sufficient to prove intent to pass title to the nephew.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA buyer validly contracted in writing to buy land from a seller. The contract had no contingencies and was silent as to risk of loss if there were damage to, or destruction of, property improvements between contract and closing, and as to any duty to carry insurance. As soon as the parties signed the contract, the seller (who had already moved out) canceled her insurance covering the land. The buyer did not know this and did not obtain insurance. A few days later, three weeks before the agreed closing date, the building on the land was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. There is no applicable statute. In an appropriate action, the buyer asserted the right to cancel the contract and to recover his earnest money. The seller said the risk of fire loss passed to the buyer before the fire, so the buyer must perform. If the seller prevails, what is the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Once the parties signed the contract, only the buyer had an insurable interest and so could have protected against this\nloss.\nB. The buyer's constructive possession arising from the contract gave him the affirmative duty of protecting against loss\nby fire.\nC. The seller's cancellation of her casualty insurance practically construed the contract to transfer the risk of loss to the\nbuyer.\nD. Upon execution of the contract, the buyer became the equitable owner of the land under the doctrine of equitable\nconversion.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "C is correct. The contract did not address risk of loss or damage to improvements. Under the UCC, where the contract is silent with regard to insurance, the buyer bears the risk of loss unless the seller is able to establish that the buyer assumed the risk by contract or by conduct. In this case, the seller has not established that the buyer assumed the risk of loss by fire. Instead, the seller has breached the contract by cancelling her insurance policy. As soon as she cancelled the policy, the buyer had a duty to obtain insurance. By failing to obtain insurance, the buyer assumed the risk of loss by fire. A is incorrect. The seller's interest in the insurance policy did not transfer to the buyer, nor did the buyer become the insured. B is incorrect. Constructive possession does not give the buyer a duty to insure against loss by fire. D is incorrect. The doctrine of equitable conversion does not apply to insurable interests."

On nights of athletic events, the woman and her family members wore earplugs and could not sleep or enjoy a quiet evening until after 10 p.m. In addition, light from the stadium on those nights was bright enough to allow reading a newspaper in the woman's yard.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The woman is arguing that the school district's actions interfered with her possessory interest in her land, causing her to suffer a concrete injury in the form of monetary damages. The facts clearly indicate that the woman has suffered an injury to her property interest, and that the school district's actions were the cause of her injury. The issue is whether those injuries are sufficient to constitute a legal \"wrong\" under the facts. For these injuries to constitute a wrong, the woman must show that the school district failed to act as a neighbor would under similar circumstances. Because the woman's injuries are real and substantial, and the school district's actions caused them, A is the best answer. B is incorrect. While the woman's injuries are real and substantial, they do not amount to a nuisance under the facts. Private nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with another's use or enjoyment of property. The light and noise coming from the stadium is certainly substantial, but it is not unreasonable. C is incorrect. While the woman's injuries are real and substantial, they do not amount to a public nuisance under the facts. Public nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with a person's health or property, or with the public peace and order, which occurs upon public lands or in places of public resort. The light and noise coming from the stadium is certainly substantial, but it is not unreasonable. In addition, the woman's property is not in a place of public resort. D is incorrect. Waste is the loss of value of land caused by the presence of a substance that is foreign, injurious, and excessive in relation to its surrounding area. While the light and noise coming from the stadium may be substantial, it is not foreign, injurious, or excessive in relation to the surrounding area."

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant was charged with burglary. At trial, a police officer testified that, after the defendant was arrested and agreed to answer questions, the officer interrogated him with a stenographer present, but that he could not recall what the defendant had said. The prosecutor presented the officer with a photocopy of the stenographic transcript of the interrogation. The officer, after looking at it, was prepared to testify that he recalled that the defendant admitted to being in the area of the burglary. The defendant objected to the officer's testimony on the ground that it violated the \"original document\" rule (also known as the \"best evidence\" rule). Should the officer's testimony concerning the defendant's recorded confession be admitted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a photocopy cannot be used without a showing that the original is unavailable.\nB. No, because the stenographer has not testified to the accuracy of the transcript.\nC. Yes, because a photocopy is a duplicate of the original.\nD. Yes, because the prosecutor is not attempting to prove the contents of the document.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

It would not be necessary, however, to show that the transcript is a correct copy of the stenographic shorthand, because the photocopy is a duplicate of the original. C is incorrect. Although a photocopy is a duplicate of the original, it is still subject to the \"best evidence\" rule, which dictates that if the original document is unavailable, a photocopy can be used only if it is shown that the copy is a faithful reproduction of the original. D is correct. The prosecutor is trying to prove what the defendant said, not what the transcript says. Accordingly, the \"best evidence\" rule does not come into play.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant was charged in federal court with selling a controlled substance (heroin) in interstate commerce.

            "explanation": "In slander cases, where the defendant makes a statement that the plaintiff has an unsavory character, the plaintiff's character is considered \"in issue\" (i.e., an essential element of the claim or defense under the substantive law) in two respects: First, the plaintiff's actual character will determine whether the defendant was incorrect in his assessment, and thus liable for slander, because truth is a defense. Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched; but if the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character and to the extent of damages.

As such, it is hearsay, does not meet the requirements of any exception to the hearsay rule, and is inadmissible. B is incorrect. The plaintiff's physician is not shown to be unavailable for the purposes of the hearsay rule. Under the hearsay rule, a statement is considered unavailable if the declarant is subject to the process of the court and unable to attend trial as a result of death, then the statement would be considered unavailable. Since the plaintiff's physician is not dead, he is not considered unavailable, and his letter would not be admissible under the hearsay rule. C is incorrect. The business records exception to the hearsay rule allows for the admission of statements of fact concerning the conduct of the business, as long as the statements were made by individuals with knowledge, if the records were kept in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity, and if they were relied upon by the plaintiff in preparation for trial.

            "explanation": "The doctor's letter is not a business record under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), because it was not prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity. In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case. There is no other exception that appears even close to being applicable (and none listed in the possible answers), so the letter is inadmissible hearsay.",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA construction company was digging a trench for a new sewer line in a street in a high-crime neighborhood. During the course of the construction, there had been many thefts of tools and equipment from the construction area. One night, the construction company's employees neglected to place warning lights around the trench. A delivery truck drove into the trench and broke an axle. While the delivery driver was looking for a telephone to summon a tow truck, thieves broke into the delivery truck and stole $350,000 worth of goods. The delivery company sued the construction company to recover for the $350,000 loss and for $1,500 worth of damage to its truck. The construction company stipulated that it was negligent in failing to place warning lights around the trench, and admits liability for damage to the truck, but denies liability for the loss of the goods. On cross-motions for summary judgment, how should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny both motions, because there is evidence to support a finding that the construction company should have realized\nthat its negligence could create an opportunity for a third party to commit a crime.\nB. Grant the construction company's motion, because no one could have foreseen that the failure to place warning lights\ncould result in the loss of a cargo of valuable goods.\nC. Grant the construction company's motion, because the criminal acts of third persons were a superseding cause of the\nloss.\nD. Grant the delivery company's motion, because but for the construction company's actions, the goods would not have\nbeen stolen.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "D is correct. The construction company's negligent act of failing to place warning lights around the trench was the cause in fact of the delivery company's loss, and it is therefore liable for the entire damage, not just the damage to the truck. The fact that the theft could not have occurred without the negligent act of the construction company is sufficient causation. The passage of time between the negligent act and the injury is irrelevant. The fact that the theft was committed by a third person is irrelevant. It is the negligent act of the construction company that caused the injury, not the act of the third person. Thus, A is incorrect. The fact that the construction company's negligent act created an opportunity for a third person to commit a crime is not sufficient to impose liability. Such an opportunity, even if it is foreseeable, does not mean that the construction company is liable for the consequences of that crime. B is incorrect. While it is likely that the construction company could not have foreseen that its negligent act would result in the loss of a cargo of valuable goods, it is still the proximate cause of the injury. The passage of time between the negligent act and the injury is irrelevant. The fact that the theft could not have occurred without the negligent act of the construction company is sufficient causation. C is incorrect. The criminal acts of third persons are not a superseding cause of the injury. While the theft could not have occurred without the negligent act of the construction company, it was not a superseding cause. Allowing the theft to occur was not a use of the delivery company's property in a manner that was not intended or foreseen by the delivery company. Thus, D is correct. The construction company's negligent act of failing to place warning lights around the trench was the cause in fact of the delivery company's loss, and it is therefore liable for the entire damage, not just the damage to the truck. The fact that the theft could not have occurred without the negligent act of the construction company is sufficient causation.

By purposely misrepresenting facts about the investment company, the personnel director caused the job applicant to suffer emotional distress. As with other torts, for negligent misrepresentation to be found, the defendant's conduct must be a substantial factor in causing the harm. Because the personnel director's misrepresentations caused the job applicant to suffer emotional distress, and that distress was a substantial factor in causing him to suffer pecuniary loss, in the form of losing out on a job opportunity, the job applicant is likely to prevail in his negligent misrepresentation action. A is incorrect. While this answer is technically correct, it is irrelevant to the question. Some jurisdictions may allow recovery for purely emotional distress, but for the purposes of this question, we are assuming that the state where the job applicant is located requires that the plaintiff suffer pecuniary loss in addition to emotional distress. B is incorrect. While this answer is also technically correct, it is irrelevant to the question.

The parties also agreed that the snail would have been visible in the bottle before the consumer opened it. Will the consumer prevail in her action against the store?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the consumer could have seen the snail in the bottle.\nB. No, because the store was not responsible for the bottling process.\nC.

The facts clearly indicate that the store failed to exercise due care, which caused the consumer to be physically ill.

The store can be held liable for the injuries caused by the snail even if it did not place the snail in the bottle, so long as it failed to exercise due care in safeguarding against such an injury. A is incorrect. The consumer can recover for the store's negligence even if she could have seen the snail. Under the negligence standard, the store would be liable for the consumer's injuries, even if the consumer had a duty to discover the snail before drinking the soda. B is incorrect. While this answer is correct, it is irrelevant to the question. The facts indicate that the store did not exercise due care, which caused the consumer to be physically ill.

The day care center was located near a man-made duck pond on the property of a corporation. During the winter, the pond was used for ice skating when conditions were suitable. At a time when the pond was only partially frozen, the child sneaked away from the center and walked out onto the ice covering the pond. The ice gave way, and the child fell into the cold water. He suffered shock and would have drowned had he not been rescued by a passerby.

The jurisdiction follows a rule of pure comparative negligence. In a suit brought on the child's behalf against the corporation, who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n[NOTE: These facts are repeated from question #93.] A bright nine-year-old child attended a day care center after school. The day care center was located near a man-made duck pond on the property of a corporation. During the winter, the pond was used for ice skating when conditions were suitable. At a time when the pond was only partially frozen, the child sneaked away from the center and walked out onto the ice covering the pond. The ice gave way, and the child fell into the cold water. He suffered shock and would have drowned had he not been rescued by a passerby. At the time of the incident, the pond was clearly marked with signs that stated, \"THIN ICE - NO SKATING.\" When the child left the day care center, the center was staffed with a reasonable number of qualified personnel, and the center's employees were exercising reasonable care to ensure that the children in their charge did not leave the premises. The jurisdiction follows a rule of pure comparative negligence. In a suit brought on the child's behalf against the day care center, who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The child, because he left the center while he was under the center's care.\nB. The child, because the day care center is located near a pond.\nC. The day care center, because it was not negligent.\nD. The day care center, because the child was a trespasser.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
