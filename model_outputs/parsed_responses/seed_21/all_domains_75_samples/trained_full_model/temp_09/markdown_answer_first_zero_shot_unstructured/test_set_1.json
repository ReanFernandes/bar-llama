            "explanation": "D is correct. For diversity purposes, a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of the state in which it was incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business. A plaintiff, however, cannot use this definition to assert diversity when bringing suit against a company he is suing in a representative capacity for other shareholders. Instead, for these types of suits, a court will apply the definition of principal place of business that was in effect when the shareholder brought suit. This definition has changed over time; it now includes the location of the company\u2019s major place of manufacturing. Thus, A is incorrect. B is incorrect because it is irrelevant for these purposes whether the company has sufficient minimum contacts in the state where the shareholder is suing. C is incorrect because the company\u2019s headquarters location is not the appropriate test for determining diversity in these types of cases."

            "question_number": 1,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

Although the claims are related, the depositor is seeking $30,000 in damages, and the bank has moved to dismiss the claim for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants.

Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect.

And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party.

Because the defendant did not object to any of the instructions, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51(d)(2) provides that the defendant\u2019s appeal can only be successful if the instruction affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, which is the standard for plain error. Answer B is incorrect. There is no obligation to seek a new trial before challenging jury instructions on appeal, so long as the applicable plain error standard can be satisfied. Plain error is the standard because the defendant failed to object at trial. Answer C is incorrect. Plain error, not abuse of discretion, is the standard for reviewing instructions that the parties did not object to, as was the case here. Answer D is incorrect. The errors were not waived by the failure to object. Rather, the failure to object waived full review, with the result that the standard for assigning error was raised to plain error.",

The manufacturer\u2019s attorney proposed an instruction that the jury should not return a verdict for the consumer if it found that the consumer had been contributorily negligent.

The consumer\u2019s attorney could not have objected before the judge gave the instruction, because the consumer\u2019s attorney did not know whether the judge would give the instruction. When the judge gives instructions, the parties are not permitted to object beforehand to instructions that the judge may give, in order to give the judge the flexibility to give appropriate instructions in light of the evidence.

When the judge gives instructions, the parties are not permitted to object beforehand to instructions that the judge may give, in order to give the judge the flexibility to give appropriate instructions in light of the evidence. C is incorrect. The civil rules concerning plain error do not apply in criminal cases. Moreover, even if they did apply here, they would not be satisfied. First, there is no error at all, because the consumer\u2019s attorney knew that he could not object to the instruction until after it was given. Second, the error would not be plain, because the instruction was proper under the applicable law before the trial, and the judge himself had told the parties that he would give the instruction. Third, the error would not have affected the consumer\u2019s substantial rights, because the consumer would have lost even without the instruction, and the consumer\u2019s attorney could have objected to the judgment if he thought it was erroneous. D is correct. The consumer\u2019s attorney could object within a reasonable time after the judge gave the instruction.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer D is incorrect. For most objections to jury instructions, the objection must be made before the instruction is given to the jury. There is no 28-day window after the jury is instructed to object to any instructions. The exception to the general rule of making all objections before the jury is instructed is for objections of plain error, which is the case here.",

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC.

However, under the facts, the friend cannot prevail on his theory because the store could not foresee that someone would be injured by the rope.

Under the facts, the friend cannot meet this requirement because the manager had no reason to expect that the friend, who was merely a passive bystander, would be harmed by cutting the rope. B is incorrect. Under the facts, the friend cannot prevail on his theory because the store could not foresee that someone would be injured by the rope.

C is incorrect. This is a negligence action and not a strict liability action. In a strict liability action, the court would have to rule that the store has a duty to the friend to protect him from the rope. However, in a negligence action, the issue is whether the store breached its duty of care, which it would not have had in any case, since the friend was not a foreseeable plaintiff. D is correct.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery.

Diversity is determined on an individual basis, and the counterclaim will be analyzed separately from the main claim. If the broker\u2019s claim against the investor is a claim for breach of contract that is a permissive counterclaim, then the investor will not be precluded from litigating the merits of her defense even if she prevails on her claim against the broker. C is incorrect. There is no such thing as a compulsory counterclaim. Instead, there are permissive counterclaims and obligatory counterclaims. A permissive counterclaim requires the permission of the court; an obligatory counterclaim does not. D is correct. The broker\u2019s claim against the investor is a permissive counterclaim because it is not an obligation that arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action, but rather a claim that the broker wants to add on."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

            "explanation": "A is correct. The President shares power with Congress by enacting legislation that Congress has the primary responsibility to write. As part of that power-sharing relationship, Congress may set out the terms and conditions of the presidency in statute. Here, Congress has done just that by giving the President the power to appoint and remove officers of the United States without Senate consent, as set forth in Article II, \u00a7 2, cl. 3 of the Constitution. Although the Constitution does not give the Senate any power to advise or consent to the removal of inferior officers, Congress may regulate the removal of its own officers, so long as it does not interfere with the presidential power of appointment. In this case, the Senate\u2019s refusal to consent to the removal of the director does not implicate the separation of powers because it is within Congress\u2019s power to legislate with regard to its own officers. Furthermore, the director, although an officer of the United States, is not an appointee subject to the advice and consent of the Senate under the Constitution. B is incorrect. Article II, \u00a7 2, cl. 3 of the Constitution gives the President authority to remove officers of the United States at pleasure, subject only to the condition that the Senate must be given an opportunity to advise and consent to the removal of principal officers. Although the Constitution does not specifically define \"principal officers,\" the Supreme Court has held that the position of director of the federal drug enforcement agency is not a principal officer because it is not part of the executive power of the United States. As such, the President may remove the director at his pleasure, and he need not seek the Senate's advice or consent to the removal. C is incorrect. The presidential power to remove officers of the United States, including officers whose positions are established by statute, is unreviewable by the courts unless the removal violates an excessive amount of time. D is incorrect.

In a written agreement, the government agreed to pay the contractor an annual fixed fee and to reimburse the contractor for all expenses associated with the work. The agreement provided that the contractor must pay for all materials and expenses from a special bank account into which the government would deposit required payments and reimbursements. The state collected a generally applicable sales tax from the contractor on materials purchased for the work with money from the special bank account. Was the state\u2019s imposition of the sales tax constitutional in this situation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the federal government is immune from any taxes levied by a state.\nB. No, because the tax was paid from an account directly funded with federal money and the entire economic cost of the tax was borne by the federal government.\nC. Yes, because payment of the tax did not unduly interfere with the contractor\u2019s performance of the work and was not an undue burden on a federal function.\nD.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

Under the equal protection clause, race cannot be the basis for a classification in a law unless it is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest.

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts.

The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children. What would be the wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Duress.\nB. Mistake.\nC. Unconscionability.\nD. Undue influence.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "C is correct. The brother\u2019s actions before and during the signing of the contract were so extreme that they would shock the conscience of a reasonable person, and the agreement should be set aside. The brother's statements, combined with the attorney's repeated assurances that the wife needed to sign the document quickly, coerced the wife into signing the agreement. A is incorrect because duress requires the threatening party have the ability to carry out the threat, and the brother could not have carried out his threat to buy the farm himself. B is incorrect because a mistake of fact will not suffice if the mistake relates to basic human needs, such as the need for food, shelter, or medical care. The wife's mistake relates to her need to sell the farm, so it is a mistake of law. D is incorrect because undue influence requires a relationship in which one party has significant control over the other and takes advantage of that control to induce the other to enter an agreement that is not fair and equitable. The brother and his attorney did not have a position of dominance over the wife, and they did not take advantage of it."

The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber.

An offer to enter into a contract is not revocable merely because the offeree has relied on it. In this case, the firm relied on the bid by including it in its bid submission to the municipality. Therefore, pursuant to UCC 2-706(2)(b), the subcontractor's bid was not revocable because the firm accepted it and gave consideration. Thus, the subcontractor was not free to revoke the bid; it was merely subject to the conditions that UCC 2-711(3) places on all acceptances, including the non-revocation condition that the offeree not have relied on the offer. C is the best choice because it provides the correct legal basis for the amount of damages recoverable from the subcontractor."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

If the condition is not satisfied, the obligation may be excused. However, where the condition is indefinite, the obligation will be void ab initio (from the beginning). A is incorrect because the parties' agreement to pay $150 per hour for services is not an indefinite price term. The landlord's agreement to pay $150 per hour for services is expressed in a writing, which satisfies the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, the landlord's obligation to pay $150 per hour for services would be conditioned upon the company's substantial performance (i.e., providing services in excess of 100 hours). However, because the parties failed to include the discounted-rate provision in the writing, there is no evidence that the landlord agreed to pay a discounted rate for services in excess of 100 hours, and the company will not be able to perform on the constructive condition, so the contract will not be void ab initio but will be reformed to reflect the agreed-upon $125 per hour rate for services in excess of 100 hours. B is incorrect because, as stated above, under the doctrine of constructive conditions, the landlord's obligation to pay $150 per hour for services would be conditioned upon the company's substantial performance (i.e., providing services in excess of 100 hours).

Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, the landlord's obligation to pay $150 per hour for services would be conditioned upon the company's substantial performance (i.e., providing services in excess of 100 hours).

            "explanation": "A is correct. The only consideration supporting the deed the daughter received from her father was her promise to pay $300,000 to the nephew upon the father's death. Although the daughter did not intend to keep that promise, the deed she received was a quitclaim deed, which merely transferred whatever interest the father had in the property at that time, if any. The daughter had not, at that point, relied on the deed in any way, so there was no consideration to support the deed. Subsequently, the father directed the daughter to pay $50,000 of the $300,000 to the neighbor. Because the deed to the daughter was only a quitclaim deed, the father still had no interest in the property that he could transfer to the neighbor; the $50,000 the father directed the daughter to pay was a gift, and there was no consideration to support it. B is incorrect. The nephew had no rights as a third-party beneficiary under the deed the daughter received from her father. The only interest the nephew had was that, if the daughter did not pay him the $300,000, the nephew could bring an action for specific performance against the daughter. As a result, even if the nephew had been written into the deed, he still would not have had any interest in the property that was transferable without his permission. C is incorrect. A transfer of an interest in land must be in writing and signed by the grantor. In this case, the only interest the father had to transfer was his interest in the $300,000 that his daughter had promised to pay to the nephew. Because the interest the father purported to transfer was a personalty, rather than a realty, it did not need to be identified in the deed, and it was not transferred validly. D is incorrect. A deed is never enforceable without consideration. In this case, the interest the daughter received in exchange for her promise to pay $300,000 to the nephew was a quitclaim deed. Although the consideration for that deed was the daughter's promise, the deed was merely a quitclaim deed, which transferred any interest the father may have had at that time in the property, if any.

Similarly, under the UCC, a party may not improperly interfere with another party's performance or enforcement of the contract. If a party improperly induces a third party to breach a contract, the party who suffered the injury may bring an action for tortious interference with contract. A motion for summary judgment will be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. There is no genuine issue of material fact in this case regarding the applicability of the UCC's provisions on interference with a contract. The only issue is whether the UCC's provisions apply. A is incorrect because duress is used to avoid a party's obligation when that party's performance is not a matter of legal right, but rather depends upon a choice. Under the facts of this case, the purchasers had a legal right to cancel the contract; they did not need to choose to cancel, they were legally permitted to do so. C is incorrect because the contracts were not subject to the statutory cancellation rights because they were not retail installment contracts as defined by statute. D is incorrect because a party may not improperly interfere with another party's performance or enforcement of the contract."

            "explanation": "B is correct. In negligence, the traditional common law defense of assumption of risk is an issue of comparative responsibility, not of legal defense. Assumption of risk must be proven by the defendant (owner) and, if established, will result in a finding of comparative negligence on the part of the plaintiff (man). In comparative negligence jurisdictions, responsibility is determined by a percentage allocation applied to the damages. If the jury finds that the man assumed the risk of using the stairs in darkness but also finds that the owner had a duty to warn, the man's injuries will be reduced by the percentage of fault attributed to his own negligence. The man's recovery would be limited to the percentage of damages that the owner caused, minus the percentage attributed to the man's negligence. Because the stairway was not a latent condition, the man would not be entitled to punitive damages. A is incorrect. The jury is not asked to calculate a percentage of responsibility; rather it is asked to make a comparative determination. C is incorrect. The man is not a mere licensee because he paid for the use of the premises. However, the man is not an invitee because he was not invited to use the premises for any length of time.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The debt collector acted with malice by intentionally or recklessly causing severe emotional distress through outrageous or extreme conduct. Under the facts of this situation, nearly all jurisdictions would allow a plaintiff to recover for emotional distress caused by severe anxiety and loss of sleep. As such, A is the best choice. B is incorrect because the debt collector\u2019s actions fell short of the level of outrageousness that would support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. There is no indication in the facts that the debt collector\u2019s actions went beyond a level of outrageousness that would be extreme and unusual, and thus B is incorrect. C is incorrect because industry custom cannot be used as a defense in an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Industry custom is relevant only in a negligence action to determine a reasonable standard of care. In an intentional infliction of emotional distress action, the focus is on the defendant\u2019s malice, so the debt collector\u2019s conduct must be extreme and outrageous. D is incorrect because extreme and outrageous conduct is a necessary element of this claim. Not all actions that are extreme or outrageous would give rise to a successful intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Under the facts of this situation, nearly all jurisdictions would allow a plaintiff to recover for emotional distress caused by severe anxiety and loss of sleep. As such, D is incorrect."

A conclusion that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous, combined with the fact that the woman experienced severe emotional distress and the fact that the debt collector was probably at least reckless with respect to the risk of causing her distress, will provide the woman with a plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman\u2019s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.   Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous.

            "explanation": "D is correct. This is a products liability question. The amusement park has a duty to use reasonable care in the construction and maintenance of the fireworks, and in the way they are launched. If a rocket fails to shoot upward and hits a spectator, it is foreseeable that injury could occur. Therefore, the amusement park could potentially be liable for negligence. A is incorrect. Abnormally dangerous activity on the part of the amusement park would only apply if the rocket malfunction was due to a chemical or other natural process that was unmistakably dangerous and could not be contained by any known technology. This is not the case, as any number of technologies could have prevented the rocket from launching. B is incorrect. Battery only applies to the actions of a person. A corporation would be sued for negligence in this case. C is incorrect. A nuisance is a condition that is offensive or dangerous to health, or a substantial interference with the use or enjoyment of property. A rocket malfunction during a fireworks display is not a nuisance in the sense of being a health hazard. The rocket was in fact enjoyable, just in an unexpected way."

Answer B is incorrect. The spectator was injured in an accident: the amusement park did not intend to touch the spectator in a harmful or offensive manner, as is required for battery liability. Answer C is incorrect. The spectator suffered personal injuries. The tort of nuisance imposes liability for unreasonable interference with another person\u2019s use or enjoyment of their property.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Unsightly conditions do not, in and of themselves, constitute a private nuisance. The farmer's actions are generally consistent with those of other farmers in the area, and thus he has not substantially interfered with the homeowner's use or enjoyment of her property in a way that is unreasonable. A, B and C are incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

When a party inadvertently discloses privileged information, it does not waive the privilege unless it has been specifically waived or the court finds a significant public interest in disclosure that outweighs the damage to the privilege. Here, because the manufacturer had not claimed a privilege over the communications between the manufacturer\u2019s president and counsel, their inadvertent disclosure did not waive the privilege. B is correct. The woman was correct that there had been a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to the two documents. However, there had not been a waiver of the privilege as to the remaining 23 documents. There is no such thing as a general waiver of the attorney-client privilege. For each document, the party seeking to waive the privilege must specifically identify the content of the document and why the privilege should be waived. Here, the woman waived the privilege as to the two documents, but not as to the other 23. C is incorrect. Even though the 23 documents relate to the same subject matter as the first two documents, that in and of itself does not result in a waiver of the privilege for all 25 documents.

            "explanation": "D is correct. A photograph that has been authenticated by testimony is self-authenticating. The witness's testimony that he took the photograph with his cell phone and that the photograph accurately portrays what he saw, in combination with the fact that the photograph is consistent with the available lighting at the time it was taken, is sufficient to authenticate the photograph. A is incorrect. The photograph is not unfairly prejudicial. It is relevant evidence that, when viewed in the context of all the other evidence in the case, will not lead the jury to improperly determine the legal rights or duties of any party. B is incorrect. There is no requirement that the technology used to take a photograph be established by testimony. However, in order to authenticate a photograph, the witness must testify that the photograph accurately depicts the scene that he observed. C is incorrect. To establish that a photograph is authentic, the witness's testimony must identify the photograph, indicate that the witness took it, and explain how he is familiar with the scene depicted in the photograph."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The witness\u2019s testimony is sufficient to authenticate the photograph under FRE 901. It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph \u201cis what the proponent claims it is.\u201d The witness\u2019s proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw it. Proof that cell-phone technology produces accurate photographs is unnecessary, given the witness\u2019s testimony. Answer D is incorrect. The photograph is not self-authenticating; it falls under none of the categories of self- authenticating documents listed in FRE 902. A witness is required to authenticate it, in this case the witness who took the photograph.",

A forfeiture of constitutional rights, whether it be a Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule or a Sixth Amendment confrontation right, will be found by the court if a defendant \"knowingly and intentionally waived\" the right in question, and there was no miscarriage of justice. In making this determination, the court will consider whether the defendant was fully apprised of his constitutional rights and knowingly and intentionally waived them, and whether the defendant's actions were sufficient to forfeit the right. In this case, the defendant killed the rival, so he clearly waived whatever right he had not to testify. However, he did not intentionally waive his right, because the defendant may not know that he had a constitutional right not to testify, and thus could not intentionally waive it. Thus, he has forfeited his confrontation objection but not his hearsay objection. B is incorrect. In this case, the defendant killed the rival, so he clearly waived whatever right he had not to testify.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying. Here, the defendant\u2019s purpose for his wrongful conduct (killing the declarant) was revenge for a theft and not a desire to prevent trial testimony. Therefore, the prosecutor cannot make the showing of intent required for forfeiture of either objection. Answers A and B are incorrect for the reasons set out above.   Answer D is incorrect. The federal courts have held that a trial judge may find the threshold requirements for forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. Further, the preponderance standard applies to the trial judge\u2019s determinations on preliminary questions of admissibility under FRE 104(a).",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The defense attorney should have immediately objected when the witness related inadmissible hearsay. An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103. In addition, the delayed objection failed to preserve the right to appeal, because the defense attorney did not state a specific basis for the objection under FRE 103. Answer A is incorrect. Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103. Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect. An objection must be made at the earliest opportunity under FRE 103, and an objection that is made \u201cduring trial\u201d but not while the witness is still on the stand is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.",

As such, it is hearsay, and does not fall into any exception to the hearsay rule and is thus inadmissible. B is incorrect. The prosecutor does not need to show that the woman cannot be compelled to testify if the defendant\u2019s attorney establishes that the woman is unavailable. If the defendant\u2019s attorney does not make this showing, the woman\u2019s statement is inadmissible because it is hearsay not within any exception. C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement is inadmissible because it is hearsay not within any exception. Further, even if it were admissible, the statement would be used against the defendant as a coconspirator. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 703, statements of a coconspirator of a defendant offered against the defendant are only admissible if the defendant has been charged with conspiracy and the statement is not too ambiguous to be useful. In this case, although the defendant has been charged with selling cocaine, there has been no allegation that he conspired with the woman. Further, if the statement is admissible, it would be used to show that the defendant and the woman were in a conspiracy together, and not to prove that the defendant sold the cocaine. D is incorrect. A declaration against a penal interest is an out-of-court statement being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, which is that the defendant sold cocaine. As such, it is hearsay and inadmissible unless it falls into an exception. Because it does not, it is inadmissible. Even if it were admissible, a declaration against a penal interest is admissible only if the matter asserted in the declaration -- that the defendant sold cocaine -- is not the type that the jury could decide on its own. In this case, that is exactly what the jury can do. E is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement is that the defendant was her cocaine supplier.

Can the lawyer be compelled to disclose the client\u2019s identity to the grand jury?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the identity of a lawyer\u2019s client is protected by the attorney-client privilege.\nB. No, because the lawyer\u2019s testimony would undermine the client\u2019s privilege against self- incrimination.\nC. Yes, because the identity of a lawyer\u2019s client is not privileged when disclosure would not reveal a confidential attorney-client communication.\nD.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The attorney-client privilege covers confidential communications made during a legal consultation between an attorney and client. If the disclosure of the client\u2019s identity would not reveal any confidential information, the privilege does not apply. In this case, the security guard\u2019s testimony does not reveal any confidential communications between the lawyer and client, so the privilege does not apply to prevent disclosure of the client\u2019s identity. A is incorrect because the attorney-client privilege covers confidential communications made during a legal consultation between an attorney and client. The identity of the client in this case, even if he were the person who was driving, would not reveal any confidential information. B is incorrect because, if the client were the person who hit the pedestrian, he would not be invoking his privilege against self-incrimination by simply having his identity disclosed. It is important to note that the privilege against self-incrimination applies only to testimonial or communicative evidence, and not to acts that would not be incriminating in and of themselves. In this case, the client\u2019s identity, even if he were the driver, would not be testimonial. D is incorrect because the rules of evidence do apply at a grand jury proceeding. In particular, the attorney-client privilege is a rule of evidence that applies outside of a courtroom."

Disclosure to the grand jury of the client\u2019s identity would not reveal anything about the communications between the client and the lawyer; the attorney-client privilege therefore does not apply, and the lawyer can be compelled to make the disclosure. Answer A is incorrect because the identity of a lawyer\u2019s client is generally not protected by the attorney-client privilege; disclosure of the client\u2019s identity alone would not reveal any confidential attorney-client communications. Answer B is incorrect. The privilege against self-incrimination prevents the client from being compelled to give testimony harmful to themself. It does not prevent the lawyer from disclosing the client\u2019s identity. Answer D is incorrect.

At trial, the defendant claims self- defense, testifying that he shot the victim only after the victim lunged at him with a knife. In rebuttal, the prosecutor calls an eyewitness to testify that she observed the argument from a short distance away and that she heard a gunshot before the victim lunged at the defendant. Thereafter, the defendant seeks to call the bartender from the nightclub to testify that the eyewitness had consumed a large amount of alcohol before the shooting and that the music in the nightclub at the time of the shooting was extremely loud. The prosecutor objects that the bartender\u2019s testimony would be improper impeachment. How should the judge rule on the prosecutor\u2019s objection?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Allow the bartender\u2019s testimony about both the eyewitness\u2019s alcohol consumption and the music.\nB. Allow the bartender\u2019s testimony about the music but not about the eyewitness\u2019s alcohol consumption, because alcohol consumption is an improper basis for impeachment.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Evidence of a witness's intoxication can be used to impeach his or her testimony if the intoxication is likely to cause the witness to be unsound in his or her memory, perception, or judgment. In this case, the bartender's testimony as to the noise level and volume of the music at the nightclub is admissible to impeach the eyewitness's testimony as to what she saw and heard. However, the bartender's testimony as to the eyewitness's level of intoxication is admissible only to impeach her testimony as to what she heard and not what she saw. The bartender's testimony as to the noise and music level, if relevant and admissible for another purpose, can also be offered as a basis for finding that the eyewitness was not a reliable observer. Thus, A is incorrect. B is incorrect because the evidence of the eyewitness's intoxication cannot be used as impeachment unless it is probative of the eyewitness's ability to observe, hear, and remember. The volume of the music alone would not be sufficient for this conclusion. D is incorrect because extrinsic evidence can be used to impeach the testimony of a person who is not the declarant. In this case, the eyewitness's intoxication is being used to impeach her testimony as to what she heard."

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

A party's interest in land is bound by the restrictions, conditions, and reservations of previous owners, even if the party had no actual notice of those restrictions. These interests are known as equitable servitudes. An equitable servitude in a deed is established by a covenant that runs with the land, even if it was not explicitly identified in the deed.

A is incorrect because estoppel only applies to equitable servitudes that run with the land if the party being estopped had notice of the servitude. Since none of the parties had actual notice of the equitable servitude, estoppel cannot apply. B is incorrect because consideration is not required for the creation of an equitable servitude, which arises from a party's interests in furthering the intent of the grantor.

Her friend agreed to loan her the entire purchase price if, immediately following the purchase, the woman would deed the land to him. They also agreed that the woman would have 10 years in which to repay the loan and that the friend would deed the land back to the woman when the loan was fully repaid. Lastly, they agreed that during the 10-year period the woman could live on the land. The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her. The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB. No, because the contract between the woman and her friend merged into the deed.\nC. Yes, because the parties agreed that the woman could live on the land.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. A deed in lieu of foreclosure is a foreclosure substitute that allows a borrower to avoid a foreclosure sale by giving the deed for the property to the lender. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the deed must be given prior to the foreclosure sale. Once the deed is given, the borrower has no further rights to the property. Although not required by statute, many lenders will not accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure unless the sale price is at least equal to the mortgage debt. Under the facts of this question, the woman proposes to give the bank a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The woman wants to avoid the publicity of a foreclosure sale and protect her credit rating. The woman\u2019s proposal is a viable foreclosure substitute under the terms of the loan agreement. A is incorrect because redemption rights are statutory and apply only to mortgages for the purchase of real property. This is a mortgage for financing. C is incorrect because the woman would not be relieving herself of liability; she would simply be transferring title to the bank. B is incorrect because there is no statute which requires a foreclosure sale for residential property."

Deeds in lieu of foreclosure can be used for both commercial and residential properties. Answer D is incorrect.

When the seller's attorney approved the extension, he was effectively treating time as of the essence with respect to that particular closing date. When the buyer then relied on that commitment and was delayed for a reason beyond his control, he was not responsible for the seller's decision not to close. B is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because it suggests that time was of the essence for the entire contract. The contract had specifically provided that time would not be of the essence. When the seller's attorney agreed to the extension, he effectively treated time as being of the essence only for that particular closing date. C is incorrect.

When the seller's attorney agreed to the extension, he effectively treated time as being of the essence only for that particular closing date.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Where a seller conveys land to a government entity so long as the government entity uses the land for a particular purpose, title will automatically revert to the seller if that government entity stops using the land for that purpose. This is because such deeds are subject to the reservation of the title interest retained by the seller. Such deeds are often used to induce governments to accept land for public use (such as for a park or a highway). The government entity is given the right to use the land for the public purpose described in the deed, but must return it to the owner if it stops using it for that purpose. In this case, the facts indicate that the city stopped using the land for the express purpose for which it was conveyed (a public park) and has instead used it as public parking for the past 17 years. As such, title has reverted to the woman\u2019s son as the successor in interest to the original grantor. A is incorrect because the city did not acquire title by adverse possession. Although it did not keep the land free of all interference for the length of the statutory period, it did not intentionally interfere with the woman\u2019s right to use the language for the purpose conveyed in the deed. Rather, it was simply fulfilling its obligation to use the land for the purposes described in the deed. In addition, the woman\u2019s son was a party to the action, so he could not acquire title by adverse possession against himself. B is incorrect because the woman\u2019s interest did not lapse simply because of the city\u2019s changing needs. The facts indicate that the city was bound by the terms of the deed to keep using the land for the purpose conveyed. It did so for 17 years, but ceased use of the land as a park and instead used it as public parking. As such, the woman\u2019s interest did not lapse and title reverted to her heir, the son. D is incorrect because the woman kept no title in the land. She conveyed it to the city subject to the reservation of the title interest retained by the woman. That interest was not affected by the city\u2019s use of the land for a different public purpose."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

A mortgage must be recorded to be enforceable against subsequent purchasers for value. Here, although the mortgage was promptly recorded, it was not recorded prior to the drop in real estate values. Subsequent purchasers would not have been aware of the mortgage, and would not have paid a premium for their interest in the property. Therefore, the mother has no personal liability on the man\u2019s debt, and her objection to the foreclosure is correct. A is incorrect. Although it is true that the mortgage on the motel was \"voluntarily\" given by the mother, it was given to secure a debt that the man owed to the bank. The mother did not have any direct obligation to the bank, and was not directly liable for repayment of the loan. B is incorrect. Although it is true that the bank could potentially pursue the man\u2019s mother for repayment of the debt, the fact that she is \"personally liable\" will not provide the bank with additional assets to use to pay off the debt.

            "explanation": "A is correct. An easement is a right to use the land of another for the benefit of that party's own land. An easement is appurtenant if it benefits a specific piece of land and runs with that land, even if it is used by the owner of that land for the benefit of another (such as a right-of-way over another's land to gain access to a public street). In contrast, an easement in gross benefits an individual, rather than a specific piece of land. An easement in gross is an ancient type of personal right, originally designed to allow a layperson to seek refuge in the church (in gross) when being unjustly pursued by an enemy. Although the terms of the man's deed to the woman described the right as being \"for the purpose of gaining access to the ocean,\" the easement is appurtenant because the terms of the deed made it so. The buyer will likely prevail because she had a right to use the man's land as described in the deed. The man cannot terminate the buyer's right to use the easement once she had it. B is incorrect because $10,000 was not a sufficient consideration to support the deed. The man did not receive any consideration in exchange for the right-of-way. Instead, the deed was executed as a gift. Although the man did not have to physically give the deed to the woman, the man did promise in the deed to convey the land in the future. As such, the deed was not enforceable, and the buyer had no obligation to pay any money to obtain the right to use the easement. C is incorrect because lack of notice is not a sufficient reason to terminate an easement once it has been established. Once established, an easement is presumed to be permanent and cannot be terminated without a showing of some unforeseen circumstance that makes it impracticable for the owner of the affected land to continue to share the area with the other party. D is incorrect because the woman's right to use the easement was appurtenant to her land, not a right in gross. As such, when the woman sold her land, the right to use the easement was automatically transferred to the buyer as a result of the deed language. The buyer had no need to do anything else to establish her rights."

The doctrine of exoneration applies where one party pays a debt owed to a third person, which the creditor has no reason to know is being paid, in order to benefit himself and the other party. Mere payment of a debt owed to a third person will not, in itself, exonerate the payer from liability to the creditor unless the creditor is charged with notice of the payment. The niece has a right to share in the profits arising from the nephew's management of the property, if any, after a partition. However, the niece's right to a share of the profits does not extend to liability for the nephew's debts without a partition. B is incorrect. This answer suggests a theory of partnership by inheritance. Although it is true that the nephew and the niece inherited the property together, they had no agreement to hold the property as tenants in common or in partnership. They were simply tenants in common, and each owned an undivided one-half interest. There was no agreement that they would hold the property together, and no \"partnership\" for the purposes of the law. C is incorrect.

The niece's right to share in the profits arising from the nephew's management of the property, if any, after a partition does not extend to liability for the nephew's debts without a partition.

Although the buyer was not aware of it at the time of the closing, the plot of land had been subject to a restrictive covenant that prohibited commercial uses. This covenant did not render the title unmarketable, so the seller did not breach the contract by delivering it to the buyer. A is incorrect. Although the buyer could not use the property for commercial purposes, this did not render the title unmarketable. Under the terms of the contract, the seller was only obligated to provide marketable title, not perfect title. In this case, the seller did so. B is incorrect. The contract did not require the seller to provide the buyer with perfect title. Instead, the contract called for the delivery of marketable title. Although the title to the property was encumbered by the restrictive covenant, the covenant was enforceable by and against a subsequent owner such as the buyer, and thus did not render the title unmarketable. D is incorrect. The seller had no control over what the buyer planned to use the land for after the closing."

The mortgage was promptly recorded. Six months later, the bank assigned only the promissory note to an investor. The assignment made no express reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The bank immediately sent the buyer a notice of the assignment, which provided the address of the investor and explained that the bank was no longer servicing the loan. The buyer made timely payments to the investor for two years but then defaulted on the loan. After the buyer failed to cure the default, the investor accelerated the debt and commenced a foreclosure action. The buyer\u2019s defense in the foreclosure action is that the investor is not the mortgagee and therefore has no right to foreclose. Does the investor have the right to foreclose?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mortgage did not automatically accompany the assignment of the note to the investor.\nB. No, because the mortgage was extinguished when the bank assigned and transferred only the note to the investor.\nC.

B is incorrect because, as stated above, the mortgage automatically transferred to the investor as the assignee of the note. D is incorrect because, even though the public records still show the bank as the mortgagee, that designation is a purely functional one for purposes of servicing the loan.

The supplier, in arranging for the murder of the lookout, intended that the murder be committed and the lookout be killed.

A is incorrect. For the actions to be part of a common scheme or plan, there must be a joint endeavor to accomplish a common objective. The supplier and the dealer did not have a common plan to murder the lookout. While the supplier intended to kill the lookout, the dealer merely wanted to scare him. B is incorrect.

Although the woman's investment of the $100,000 in the stock was not illegal, it was done for her personal benefit, rather than for the benefit of the trust. Thus, it was not the proper use of trust funds. However, the woman did not convert the $80,000 to her own use. She did not acquire ownership of the property by fraud or misrepresentation, or hold herself out as the owner of the property, or obtain possession of the property by fraud or misrepresentation.

The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect.

It does, however, prevent the jury from finding that the woman's actions were grossly reckless toward human life, a finding necessary for a conviction for murder in the common-law sense. Under the facts of this problem, the jury should be instructed on the lesser crime of depraved-heart murder, which does not require malice aforethought but does require that the defendant's actions be so reckless toward human life that they demonstrate a depraved indifference to the value of human life. B is incorrect. Involuntary manslaughter is the correct choice only if the jury believes that the woman's intoxication prevented her from being criminally negligent, and the problem indicates otherwise. C is incorrect. Intoxication cannot be used as a defense to a murder charge unless it negates the premeditation and deliberation necessary for a murder conviction.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB.

B is incorrect. Sentencing factors are different from elements of the offense. An offense has specific elements that must be proved by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. Sentencing factors are factors that the judge may consider, but is not required to consider, in determining an appropriate sentence.

To determine whether the man was serious, an undercover officer introduced himself to the man at a bar. The officer said that he had previously taken care of problems for angry spouses. After some discussion in which the man expressed his extreme anger at his ex-wife, the man offered the officer $5,000 to kill her.

The emergency aid exception allows police officers to enter a home without a warrant to prevent harm to life, even if the need for assistance is created by the suspect himself. If the man had been alone and had needed medical assistance, police officers would have been allowed to enter without a warrant under the emergency aid exception. However, because the man was only angry and was not physically injured, his refusal to let the officers in after asking for medical assistance, and his threatening to shoot them if they came in, indicated that he was not in need of aid but was instead trying to protect his property from what he believed to be an unlawful entry. Thus, he had standing to object to the officers' entry under the Fourth Amendment, and the emergency aid exception does not apply. B is incorrect because the warrantless entry would be unreasonable under the exigency exception because there was no danger to life that would have justified a warrantless entry under that exception. C is incorrect because if the man had needed medical assistance, police officers would have been allowed to enter without a warrant under the emergency aid exception even if the suspect himself had created the need for aid.

In the facts of this situation, no person was threatened with the use of force, and no property was taken from anyone. The man and his friend did not conspire to commit robbery. C is incorrect. Either conspiracy offense would require more than the agreement to commit a crime. For the man and his friend to have agreed to commit a federal offense, they would also have to intend that their co-conspirators aid and abet in the commission of the offense. In the facts of this situation, the friend's showing of a gun in his waistband is more consistent with a threat to use force against the woman than with an intent to aid and abet in the commission of a robbery.

Involuntary manslaughter is not the most serious homicide offense for which the woman can be convicted for two reasons. First, it is a specific intent crime, and the woman in this case did not act with the intent to kill or to cause great bodily harm. Second, the woman's actions in driving above the speed limit and causing an accident can be charged as reckless, not negligent, and manslaughter requires negligence. Thus, A is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
