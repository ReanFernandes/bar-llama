The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The shareholder\u2019s attorney needs to know where the company\u2019s major place of manufacturing is located in order to determine whether the company is incorporated in a state where the shareholder resides or in a state where the company is \"purposely seeking to litigate\" in that state. 28 U.S. \u00a7 1332(c). A is incorrect because the distribution of the cars is irrelevant if the state where the cars are distributed is not the state where the shareholder resides. B is incorrect because minimal contacts with a state will not make the company a citizen of that state for the purposes of \u00a7 1332(c) if the company is \"purposely seeking to litigate\" in that state.

            "question_number": 1,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The bank filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that its method of calculating interest, as described in the complaint, was proper under federal law and that the federal law preempted the depositor\u2019s state-law claim. The court granted the motion to dismiss the depositor\u2019s federal claim and reserved ruling on the motion to dismiss the state-law claim.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Twenty-five days after service of the amended complaint, the second defendant removed the action to a federal court in State B with the first defendant\u2019s consent.

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect.

The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

After several members were arrested, the organization\u2019s leader called for \u201ceven bigger demonstrations next week to halt operations at the base.\u201d The US Attorney in the jurisdiction brought a federal civil action against the organization and its leader, seeking an injunction against protests that interfered with the base\u2019s operations. With the complaint, the US Attorney moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to \u201cenjoin any blockade of the base\u2019s entrance or other disruption of base activity until the court can hear motions for a preliminary and a permanent injunction.\u201d The US Attorney attached an affidavit certifying the unsuccessful efforts she had made to locate the organization and its leader and to notify them of the motion. The court immediately held a hearing and issued the TRO in a one-sentence order that did not describe the acts to be restrained but instead incorporated by reference the allegations of the complaint and the TRO motion. Did the court properly grant the TRO?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the order did not describe in reasonable detail the acts to be restrained.\nB.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Courts may deny leave to amend when the claim to be added is futile. Here, the claim is futile on limitations grounds unless relation back applies. Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery. However, the woman\u2019s goal is to dismiss and refile the action. Submitting the described affidavit would not achieve that goal.",

The complaint alleged that the fire had been caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the house\u2019s electrical system in accordance with the applicable housing code. The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent. In opposition to that motion, the tenant argues that under federal law, contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defendant who wishes to assert the defense must plead in an answer or other responsive pleading. Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim.

United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), and Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986). Answer A is incorrect. A series of Supreme Court cases beginning with Myers sharply limits Congress\u2019s ability to impose conditions on the removal of federal officials.   Answer B is incorrect. Myers and subsequent cases make it clear that the Senate has no role in the removal of federal officers other than via impeachment. Answer D is incorrect because it is an overbroad statement of the law. The Supreme Court has upheld the power of Congress to remove certain types of federal officials, such as those serving as members of the governing bodies of regulatory agencies and inferior officers in agencies where the head of the agency is removable by the President at will.",

The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The requirement of sterilization has a disproportionate impact on men, and it is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\nC.

Here, the class being singled out is members of racial minority groups. Because the laws limiting the rights of these individuals are not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, they will be considered to be arbitrary and therefore, they will be considered to deny equal protection. A is incorrect because, although the requirement of sterilization deprives a select group of persons of a fundamental right, that classification is not sufficient by itself to trigger heightened judicial scrutiny. B is incorrect because the requirement of sterilization does not have a disproportionate impact on men. In fact, the statistic shows that more women than men are convicted of sex offenses.

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect.

The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC.

Neither of these situations applies here. B is incorrect. The parol evidence rule will not prevent proof of the parties' prior agreement concerning the lumber price, because the parties' prior agreement concerning the lumber price is not being offered to vary the terms of the written contract, but rather to supply an omission in the writing. C is correct. The contractor can prove the parties' prior agreement concerning the lumber price, and the court will reform the writing to reflect this agreement. D is incorrect.

However, if the non-occurrence of the constructive condition is excused by a supervening event, then the non-occurring party is still obligated to perform. In this case, the engineer's failure to obtain county approval of the project is excused by the county's independent refusal to approve the project. Thus, D is correct and B is incorrect. A is incorrect. The engineer's failure to obtain county approval is a breach of the contract, but it is a breach of the \"best efforts\" standard, not an outright failure to perform. As such, it is excused by the county's refusal to approve the project. C is incorrect. Payment under this type of contract is due upon the engineer's completion of the services, not upon the county's approval of the project. Thus, C is incorrect."

There is no express condition. Under the rule of constructive conditions of exchange, the performance by one party is an implied condition to performance by the other party. Since the engineer performed all obligations, the developer breached by refusing to perform the developer\u2019s contractual obligation to pay the engineer. Answer B is incorrect.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAn engineering firm submitted a bid to a municipality for the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant. The firm\u2019s bid included a subcontractor\u2019s bid to complete the electrical work on the plant for $100,000. The municipality awarded the construction contract to the firm. Later that day, before the firm told the subcontractor of the award, the subcontractor told the firm that it was withdrawing its bid because it had recently undertaken a new project that would absorb all its capacity for the next 18 months. The firm nevertheless accepted the subcontractor\u2019s bid and demanded that it perform the electrical work on the plant, but the subcontractor refused. The firm had to hire another subcontractor to perform the electrical work, at a cost of $115,000. The firm completed the construction of the plant at a profit. Which of the following statements correctly describes the firm\u2019s legal rights, if any, against the first subcontractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The firm is entitled to recover nominal damages only, because it completed the construction at a profit.\nB. The firm is entitled to recover reliance damages, because it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid when it submitted its own bid to the municipality.\nC. The firm is entitled to recover expectation damages, because the first subcontractor\u2019s bid was irrevocable for a reasonable time and the firm timely accepted it.\nD.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Under the UCC, a bidder is considered to have accepted an offer to contract by either: a) performing the bid, or b) by failing to revoc e the bid within a reasonable time after receiving the acceptance of the offer. Here, the UCC applies, because the parties contracted for the sale of goods. Although the UCC allows bidders to withdraw bids for a variety of reasons, it also states that a bidder who has accepted an offer by performing is considered to have accepted the offer for a reasonable time. Therefore, A is incorrect. Under the facts, it does not appear that the firm accepted the bid by performing, but rather by accepting the bid and then hiring another subcontractor. Thus, recovery of nominal damages would not be appropriate. B is incorrect. While reliance damages may be available under the UCC, they are only available if the party claiming damages has not been fully compensated by the other party's breach. Since the firm was able to hire another subcontractor, it has not been fully compensated for the first subcontractor's breach, and reliance damages are therefore not available. D is incorrect. The UCC allows bidders to withdraw bids for a variety of reasons, including the bidder's withdrawal from the business. However, the UCC also states that a bidder who has accepted an offer by performing is considered to have accepted the offer for a reasonable time. Therefore, D is incorrect. The first subcontractor did not have a right to withdraw its bid simply because it was no longer available to perform."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The daughter was free to modify her promise to her father unless the modification was prohibited by a term in the deed. B is incorrect. The neighbor is not a third-party beneficiary of the contract. The neighbor has no interest in the land and was not promised any right, benefit, or performance by the parties to the contract. Instead, the neighbor is a stranger to the contract and is attempting to enforce the terms of the contract against someone who is entitled to enforce those terms (the nephew). C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the neighbor is not a third-party beneficiary of the contract. However, it is incorrect to state that the father retained a transferable interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise. The only interest the father retained was the power to revoke the promise, which he did by modifying the promise through the quitclaim deed. As soon as the father revoked his promise, he could no longer benefit from any payment his daughter might make to the neighbor. Therefore, D is correct. The neighbor is likely to prevail because the modification of the promise by the father requires consideration (the neighbor\u2019s acceptance of the modification) and thus is enforceable."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

            "explanation": "D is correct. While this looks like a negligent infliction of emotional distress issue, it is a negligent placement of the advertisement issue. The company\u2019s strongest defense is that there is no evidence of negligent behavior on the part of the company. The company placed no limits on who could place an advertisement on the site. It did not even verify that the person placing the advertisement had permission to do so. There is simply no evidence that the company acted in a negligent manner. A is incorrect. The company did not act with a duty-ridden mindset. It did not owe the homeowner a duty of care and so it had no duty to the homeowner. B is incorrect. While the cousin\u2019s actions may have been a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss, that does not mean that the company is liable. If the company acted in a negligent manner, then it may be liable for the actions of the cousin. However, there is simply no evidence that the company acted negligently. C is incorrect. The First Amendment does not prohibit all tort actions based upon mere speech.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

            "explanation": "D is correct. The facts indicate that the boy was 11 years old at the time of the accident, and courts will apply a child's negligence standard to a child of that age. The child's negligence standard is lower than the adult negligence standard, and, in some jurisdictions, it is a defense to a negligence action if the defendant can show that the plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable care. Because the boy's negligence will be judged by a lower standard, he is entitled to have his negligence, if any, determined by the jury, rather than having the court decide that he is contributorily negligent. A is incorrect. the fact that the boy was driving a motorcycle does not, by itself, mean that he should be held to a higher standard of care. Many motorcyclists are not held to a higher standard simply because they ride motorcycles. B is incorrect. the fact that the boy was trespassing on the private road does not, by itself, mean that he should be held to a higher standard of care. Many trespassers are not held to a higher standard simply because they are trespassers. C is incorrect. comparative negligence does not apply here because the boy is seeking to have his own negligence, if any, determined by the jury.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA doctor ordered chest X-rays for a patient who smoked cigarettes. After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC. Yes, because punitive damages awards are not authorized unless there is proof of willful or wanton misconduct on the defendant\u2019s part.\nD. Yes, because the patient smoked cigarettes and therefore was contributorily negligent.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

An employee of the agency went to the buyer\u2019s home and knocked on the front door. When the buyer answered, the employee explained that he was there to repossess the car and asked for the car keys. The buyer handed the employee the keys but then asked the employee to allow her to retrieve her laptop computer from the car. The employee declined the request, explaining to the buyer that any possessions in the car could be reclaimed from the company after the car was repossessed. After pleading unsuccessfully with the employee, the buyer shoved the employee away from the door with such force that the employee fell and suffered a broken wrist. The buyer then ran to the car, which was unlocked, and retrieved the laptop. The employee has sued the buyer for battery. The buyer has moved for summary judgment, arguing that she was privileged to act as she did. Should the trial court grant the buyer\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

No, because after the buyer handed the keys to the employee, the car was no longer her property.\nC. Yes, because a possessor can use nonlethal force to protect his or her property.\nD.

As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA wealthy elderly woman was repeatedly harassed by a debt collector over a period of two months. The debt collector was trying to collect a large debt owed to his client by the woman\u2019s impoverished adult son. Although the debt collector knew that the woman was not legally responsible for the son\u2019s debt, he called the woman multiple times each day and threatened to destroy her credit. He also told her that he knew where she lived and that he was going to withdraw the money from her bank account. As a result, the woman suffered great mental anguish, was unable to sleep, and ultimately suffered serious health consequences. Which of the following conclusions would best support a claim by the woman against the debt collector for intentional infliction of emotional distress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The debt collector could reasonably have foreseen that the calls and threats might cause harm to the woman\u2019s health.\nB. The debt collector\u2019s conduct caused the woman to fear that he was someday going to physically attack her.\nC. The debt collector\u2019s conduct failed to comply with industry custom.\nD. The debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A is correct. The debt collector\u2019s actions here are very similar to those in the landmark case of Henson v. City of Chicago, 83 Ill.2d 167, 413 N.E.2d 399 (1980). In that case, a police officer intentionally and repeatedly rammed his squad car into a woman\u2019s automobile in an effort to get her to pull over to the side of the road. Although the officer believed that the woman to be driving while intoxicated, he knew that there was no legal basis for stopping her. Like the debt collector in this case, the police officer in Henson acted outside the scope of his official capacity, and he should have foreseen that his actions would cause emotional distress. A is the best choice because it provides the most accurate statement of the law and is not a \"bait and switch\" question. The other answers are overly broad generalizations of the law and can be eliminated immediately. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the debt collector acted intentionally, but it misstates the legal standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The debt collector\u2019s actions do not appear to be extreme and outrageous. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the debt collector\u2019s actions were extreme and outrageous, but it misstates the legal standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The debt collector\u2019s actions do not appear to be extreme and outrageous. D is incorrect. This answer incorrectly states that the debt collector acted with the purpose of causing emotional distress. The debt collector\u2019s actions do not appear to be extreme and outrageous."

A conclusion that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous, combined with the fact that the woman experienced severe emotional distress and the fact that the debt collector was probably at least reckless with respect to the risk of causing her distress, will provide the woman with a plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman\u2019s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.   Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. Answer C is incorrect. A mere failure to comply with industry custom does not establish any of the elements of IIED.",

Even though the spectator might not obtain summary judgment on a claim of liability for an abnormally dangerous activity, that claim\u2014which imposes strict liability for injuries caused by an activity that is not commonplace and that remains dangerous to bystanders even when the actor uses reasonable care to avoid causing injuries\u2014provides the spectator with the best chance of doing so. Answer B is incorrect. The spectator was injured in an accident: the amusement park did not intend to touch the spectator in a harmful or offensive manner, as is required for battery liability. Answer C is incorrect. The spectator suffered personal injuries. The tort of nuisance imposes liability for unreasonable interference with another person\u2019s use or enjoyment of their property. Answer D is incorrect. The doctrine of strict products liability applies only to commercial sellers of defective products that cause injury, and there is nothing in the question to suggest that the amusement park\u2014the only defendant in the action\u2014was in the business of selling fireworks.",

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "explanation": "D is correct. While the homeowner may be entitled to compensation for the farmer\u2019s negligent or intentional interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, the farmer is unlikely to be held liable for private nuisance. Under the facts of this problem, it is clear that the farmer has not acted with the intent to cause harm to the homeowner, nor has he acted with gross negligence. Thus, D is the best choice. A is incorrect.

As stated above, the appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. B is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the contractor and the homeowner, because neither posted a warning that the porch boards had been loosened.\nB. Neither the homeowner nor the contractor, because the friend was a licensee.\nC. The contractor only, because he was an independent contractor and he loosened the boards in a dangerously deceptive fashion without posting a warning.\nD.

While the homeowner may be vicariously liable for the contractor's negligence under the \"res ipsa loquitur\" doctrine, she will not be held liable for his negligence in this case because the contractor was an independent contractor. The contractor, on the other hand, is liable for his own negligence. Under the facts of this case, the contractor removed the boards in a negligent manner, failing to warn the homeowner or her guests about the danger. As such, C is the best answer. A is incorrect. Both the homeowner and the contractor are jointly and severably liable for the friend's injury, but neither posted a warning, so both will be found negligent. B is incorrect. The friend was a licensee, so he was not entitled to a duty of care from the homeowner, and thus he will not be found negligent. However, the homeowner and the contractor are jointly and severably liable for the friend's injury, so both will be found negligent. D is incorrect. The homeowner may be found negligent for her own actions in insisting on the removal of the boards, but she will not be found liable for the contractor's negligence in removing the boards. The contractor, on the other hand, is liable for his own negligence."

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value.

Answer B is incorrect.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection.

The stockholder has conceded that he has no formal education or training in economics or the stock market. Should the stockholder be permitted to testify to his opinion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because he is not qualified to offer opinion testimony based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge relating to stock price changes.\nB. No, because his personal interest in the outcome of the action renders his opinion insufficiently probative.\nC. Yes, because his opinion is rationally based on his perception as a stockholder and will be helpful to the trier of fact.\nD. Yes, because property owners such as the stockholder are entitled to express an opinion on changes in the value of their property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The stockholder's education and training in economics or the stock market, even if they are scientific or technical, does not disqualify him from offering his opinion. B is incorrect. The fact that the stockholder has a personal interest in the outcome of the case does not render his opinion insufficiently probative. As long as the testimony is relevant to the case and the testimony is not otherwise prohibited by law, a witness may offer an opinion even if it would be adverse to his own interests. C is correct. A witness who is testifying as an expert by opinion may offer an opinion that is rationally based on his perception, even if that opinion is contrary to the best evidence. In addition, the stockholder's opinion is helpful to the trier of fact because it is an expression of his personal knowledge and experience as a stockholder. D is incorrect. The fact that the stockholder is an owner of the property does not, by itself, entitle him to offer an opinion on the value of the property.

Under FRE 701, the stockholder\u2019s testimony is inadmissible.   Answer B is incorrect. If otherwise qualified, an expert witness can have a personal interest in the outcome of the action and still testify. The expert\u2019s personal interest can be explored on cross-examination. In this case, however, the stockholder is not qualified as an expert. Answer C is incorrect. An admissible opinion about the cause of the price drop cannot be based on the stockholder\u2019s perception; it requires an expertise that he does not possess. His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue. Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 701, property owners are entitled to express opinions on the value of their property, but here the stockholder is expressing an opinion on the cause of the publicly traded stock\u2019s price drop.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

By the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, the woman has left the country. The prosecutor calls the police officer to testify that the woman told him that the defendant was her cocaine supplier. The defendant\u2019s attorney objects. Is the woman\u2019s statement to the police officer admissible to prove that the defendant sold cocaine?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the prosecutor has not shown that the woman\u2019s attendance at trial could not have been procured through process or other reasonable means.\nC. Yes, as the statement of the defendant\u2019s coconspirator.\nD. Yes, as the woman\u2019s declaration against penal interest.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The woman's statement to the police officer is not hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. The woman is not claiming that the defendant sold her the cocaine. Instead, she is claiming that the defendant sold cocaine to other people. The defendant's attorney, therefore, cannot object to the statement on hearsay grounds. B is incorrect. The statement is admissible as a declaration against penal interest. A declaration against penal interest is an exception to the hearsay rule. The woman's statement is a declaration against penal interest because it is a statement by a participant in a crime that tends to implicate others in the crime and, at the time she made the statement, the woman faced a potential penalty of life in prison. C is incorrect. The woman's statement is not a statement of a party opponent. It is the woman's own statement, and it is not hearsay because it is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. It is not hearsay within the exception for statements of a party opponent because the defendant is not the party opponent in this case. The defendant is the one on trial, so he cannot be the party opponent. D is correct. The woman's statement to the police officer is admissible as a declaration against penal interest.

There is no hearsay exception that would apply to admit her statement against the defendant. Answer B is incorrect.

Because there is no hearsay exception that would make the woman\u2019s statement admissible to prove its truth, it would be inadmissible even if the prosecutor were to properly establish her unavailability. Answer C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement was made to a police officer following her arrest and not during a drug conspiracy with the defendant. The statement also certainly did nothing to further a drug conspiracy, even if one did exist. Answer D is incorrect. The portion of the woman\u2019s statement attributing fault to the defendant and suggesting that he was her drug supplier was not against the woman\u2019s penal interest.

Allow the bartender\u2019s testimony about both the eyewitness\u2019s alcohol consumption and the music.\nB.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

Lastly, they agreed that during the 10-year period the woman could live on the land. The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The fact that the woman made payments over the course of the 10 years does not mean that the agreement is a lease. The payments could be loan repayments or rent. To determine whether the payments are loan repayments or rent, a court would apply a presumption that the payments are loan repayments, which can be rebutted by showing that the payments were in fact rent. In this case, the friend has not rebutted the presumption that the payments are loan repayments, so the woman's payments are loan repayments, and she is likely to prevail. B is incorrect. The fact that the contract between the woman and the friend was a deed does not mean that it merged into the deed. A deed is a contract for the conveyance of land, and it can contain promises or representations in addition to the land being conveyed. The woman's promise to pay rent or loan repayments to the friend over the 10-year period is a representation that is separate from the deed and can be enforced separately. C is incorrect. The fact that the woman had the friend's permission to live on the land does not mean that she has a property interest in the land. To have a property interest in land, a person must have more than a license to occupy it. A license is permission to enter onto or to make use of land belonging to another. A license is not a property right, and one who has a license has no right to the land except for the term of the license. D is correct. The woman's agreement to pay rent or loan repayments to the friend over the 10-year period is a mortgage on the land. An equitable mortgage is a mortgage on land that is not formally recorded with the appropriate governmental authority but that nonetheless secures the payment of a debt. An equitable mortgage is enforceable for a term of years, and after that time the mortgage \"expires by its own limitation.\" If the friend had recorded the mortgage, he would have had to pay a fee to the appropriate governmental authority to ensure that the mortgage would be enforceable for a term of years. By not recording the mortgage, the friend saved this fee, but he also runs the risk that the woman will be able to enforce the mortgage after the term of years has expired."

As a matter of law there is no such presumption. Answer B is incorrect. The merger doctrine relates to contractual promises relating to the quality of transferred title. Here the promises relate to whether the terms of the conveyance were intended to transfer any title or merely create a lien on the land. Answer C is incorrect.

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA man borrowed money from a bank to finance the purchase of a commercial building. The man signed a promissory note, which was secured by a mortgage on the building. Because the man had few other unencumbered assets, the bank required additional security. The man\u2019s mother granted the bank a mortgage on a motel that she owned, but she did not sign a promissory note. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. Five years later, after real estate values had dropped considerably, the man defaulted on the loan from the bank. After acceleration, the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against both the commercial building and the motel owned by the mother. The mother timely objected to the foreclosure proceedings against the motel. The bank responded that it had the right to include both the commercial building and the motel in the foreclosure proceedings. Who is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because the motel was voluntarily mortgaged to secure the man\u2019s debt.\nB. The bank, because the mother is personally liable on any loan secured by the mortgage on the motel.\nC. The mother, because she did not sign a promissory note.\nD. The mother, because the bank does not hold an enforceable mortgage on the motel.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "D is correct. The bank has no right to foreclose on the motel even if the mortgage on the motel was originally valid. The bank's ability to foreclose on the motel depended on whether the man continued to have an interest in the motel that he could convey to the bank. When the man defaulted on the loan and the bank sought to foreclose, the man had no interest in the motel to transfer to the bank. As soon as the man defaulted, the man had no legal right to transfer the motel to the bank. As soon as the man defaulted, any interest the man had in the motel automatically reverted to the mother. For this reason, D is correct. A is incorrect. The fact that the mother may have provided the bank with additional security for the loan does not mean that the mother has any obligation to the bank once the man defaulted. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the bank has no right to foreclose on the motel, but it is incorrect in its explanation of why this is the case. B states that the mother is personally liable on the loan secured by the mortgage on the motel. This is incorrect. The man was personally liable on the loan and the mortgage. The mother had no personal liability on the loan or the mortgage. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the bank has no right to foreclose on the motel, but it is incorrect in its explanation of why this is the case. C states that the mother has no obligation to the bank once the man defaulted because she did not sign a promissory note. This answer ignores the fact that the man had an interest in the motel that he could have transferred to the bank if he had not defaulted. As soon as the man defaulted, any interest the man had in the motel automatically reverted to the mother. For this reason, C is incorrect."

Answer B is incorrect. The fact that the man received $10,000 is irrelevant. The man granted the woman an easement appurtenant, which runs with the dominant estate. An easement appurtenant may be granted by purchase or by gift. Answer C is incorrect. The buyer did purchase the land without any type of notice, but this is not a reason for the man to prevail. The easement is for the benefit of whoever owns the land. The buyer can still assert her right to the easement appurtenant because the easement has not terminated.   Answer D is incorrect.

The woman signed and promptly recorded a deed properly describing the property and identifying the man by name. The deed specified that under no circumstances was the property \u201cto ever pass to [the man\u2019s wife].\u201d Unbeknownst to the woman, the man had died before she executed and recorded the deed. Under the man\u2019s duly probated will, he had devised all of his property to his wife. When the woman learned of the man\u2019s death, she said in the presence of several witnesses, \u201cI must take back that deed, because I don\u2019t want [the man\u2019s wife] to own the apartment building.\u201d Before the woman could do anything about the deed, however, she died. By her duly probated will, she left all of her estate to her niece. There are no applicable statutes. In an appropriate action to determine the ownership of the apartment building, who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The man\u2019s wife, because the deed to the man was recorded.\nB.

The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The man was arrested for the crime of attempting to sell drugs, which is a specific intent crime. Specifically, attempt is the act of doing with intent to do, an act which is punishable under the law. To convict the man of attempt, the prosecution must establish that the man had the intent to sell drugs, and that he took a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. Because the man was arrested for attempting to sell drugs, and he was not found in possession of any drugs, he has not committed any crime. A is incorrect. While the man may be guilty of conspiracy to distribute drugs, that charge will not stick unless the man agreed with the officer to distribute drugs. Since no such agreement was made, there is no conspiracy to distribute drugs. B is incorrect. The man did not attempt to distribute drugs, so he cannot be convicted of attempted distribution of controlled substances. C is incorrect. Solicitation is the offering of a person to commit a crime. To be guilty of solicitation, the man must have offered to commit a crime, and another person must have agreed to commit the crime. Since no such agreement was made, there is no solicitation."

To determine whether the man was serious, an undercover officer introduced himself to the man at a bar. The officer said that he had previously taken care of problems for angry spouses. After some discussion in which the man expressed his extreme anger at his ex-wife, the man offered the officer $5,000 to kill her. The officer agreed and made arrangements to meet the man at the bar the next day to collect the $5,000 payment. When the man showed up the next day at the bar, authorities immediately arrested him.

A bilateral conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a felony, and the man and the officer agreed to commit the felony of murder. Therefore, B is correct, and A is incorrect. A is attempted murder, which is not the most serious crime for which the man can be convicted. C is incorrect. Solicitation of murder is not a bilateral conspiracy, and, as such, it is not the most serious crime for which the man can be convicted. D is misprision of a felony, which is not a bilateral conspiracy, and, as such, it is not the most serious crime for which the man can be convicted."

The man did nothing but offer to pay, and this conduct is not \u201cdangerously proximate\u201d to the commission of the offense as required by the common law. Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The friend is not guilty of any crime because he was not aware of the women's plan to rob the bank and did not have a duty to stop them from committing the robbery. Under the crime of accessory after the fact, a person is guilty of aiding, abetting, or concealing a crime if he or she knew another person had committed a crime and had the intent to aid, abet, or conceal the crime. However, to be found guilty of accessory after the fact, a person must have had a duty, ensuing from his or her relationship to the offender, to prevent or report the offense. The friend had no such duty, so he is not guilty of the crime of accessory after the fact. The friend is, however, guilty of the crime of aiding and abetting. To be guilty of aiding and abetting a crime, a person must have the intent to aid, abet, or encourage the commission of a crime and must have knowledge of the facts that the other person committed the crime. The friend had the requisite intent and knowledge, so he is guilty of aiding and abetting the women's bank robbery. Thus, D is correct, and A, B, and C are incorrect."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant was arrested and charged with burglary. Under state law, police are required to obtain DNA samples from all persons arrested for felonies and to store those samples in a state registry. The police informed the defendant of the state law and said that they would be using a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample from him. The defendant did not object. The defendant was later acquitted of burglary. A year later, however, authorities matched the defendant\u2019s DNA to an unsolved sexual assault crime. The defendant, now charged with sexual assault, has moved to suppress the DNA sample as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court suppress the DNA sample?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant failed to lodge a timely objection to the sample collection.\nB. No, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nC. No, because the statute violates the Fourth Amendment, but the police acted in good-faith reliance upon it.\nD. Yes, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees violates the Fourth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Yes, because defense counsel is required to present any known mitigating factors in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
