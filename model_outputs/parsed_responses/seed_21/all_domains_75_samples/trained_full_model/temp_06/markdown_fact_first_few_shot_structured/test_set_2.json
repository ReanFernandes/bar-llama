Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD. Yes, because the mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration\u2019s policies.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct because on its face the ordinance discriminates against commerce from outside the city. By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory. Such facially discriminatory laws are allowed only in the absence of any nondiscriminatory way to promote the government\u2019s interest. C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994). Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest. Answer C is incorrect. Because the law is facially discriminatory, it is not subject to the \u201cundue burden\u201d test. In addition, we do not have sufficient facts to know whether the ordinance would pass this test. Answer D is incorrect. The right to travel does not protect the right to engage in commercial enterprises while temporarily present in a state.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land. Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here. Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue. Answer D is incorrect.

Procedural due process requires that the government provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before depriving someone of a liberty interest or of an interest in property.

The ex post facto clause is violated by laws that increase the punishment for a crime after the crime was committed, even if the law furthers a legitimate interest. Answer D is incorrect.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

Although the fire was promptly extinguished and there had been no risk that it would spread, the speaker was convicted of violating a local ordinance against starting an open fire in a public place without a permit from the fire department. The speaker has challenged the conviction on constitutional grounds. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ordinance is constitutional, because it is narrowly tailored to further a significant government interest that is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and individuals have other ways of communicating their messages.\nB. The ordinance is constitutional, because it regulates conduct rather than speech.\nC.

The burning of the one-dollar bills was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, because the speaker intended the burning to communicate a message, and in context, the audience was likely to receive the message. The ordinance, however, does not violate the First Amendment because it is content-neutral and it satisfies the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which are stated correctly in Answer A.

It is true that the ordinance prohibits conduct, but on these facts, the burning of the one-dollar bills was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, because the speaker intended the burning to communicate a message, and in context, the audience was likely to receive the message. In this situation, the ordinance satisfies the First Amendment not simply because it regulates conduct, but because it is content-neutral and it satisfies the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny.      Answer C is incorrect. Notwithstanding the absence of a fire risk here, there is no indication on these facts that the prosecution was a pretext for the government\u2019s disapproval of the speaker\u2019s message. The city has a legitimate interest in enforcing the permit requirement generally because of the risks associated with open fires in public places. Answer D is incorrect. The ordinance is not overbroad because a permit requirement for open fires in public places does not restrict substantially more speech than the First Amendment allows to be restricted.",

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations is not the proper standard. Because the government is demanding public access to the property in exchange for a permit to build, the test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development.

Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause.

King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed.

Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights.

In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A.

The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB. No, because the subpoena was based on a cell- phone number that the resident had voluntarily placed in the public domain.\nC. Yes, because a subpoena must be based on probable cause.\nD. Yes, because a warrant is required to collect such extensive historical cell-phone site- location data.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

The subcontractor informed the general contractor of the mistake and asked whether the general contractor would agree to pay $15,000 for the foundation, which would cover the subcontractor\u2019s costs. After determining that other subcontractors would charge at least $18,000 for the work, the general contractor agreed in writing.

The seller expected to make a profit of $10,000 on the sale. After the seller had spent $30,000 on production of the machine and before the machine was complete, the buyer repudiated the contract. After the repudiation, the seller reasonably believed that if it completed the manufacture of the machine, it would be able to sell the machine to a third party. The seller completed the machine and sold it to a third party for $92,000. If the seller sues the buyer for breach of contract, how much, if anything, should the seller recover as damages?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $8,000, the amount of the seller\u2019s lost profit after selling the completed machine to the third party.\nB. $10,000, the seller\u2019s anticipated profit had the buyer not repudiated.\nC. $40,000, the amount the seller spent on production of the machine before the buyer\u2019s repudiation plus the seller\u2019s anticipated profit.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. If a buyer repudiates a contract for unfinished goods, the seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment proceed in any reasonable manner, including finishing the goods for resale. UCC \u00a7 2- 704(2). The seller\u2019s damages in that situation are the difference between the contract price and the resale price. UCC \u00a7 2- 706(1). Here that amount is $8,000. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale. Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale rather than seeking costs and lost profit. Note that this has the effect of reducing the seller\u2019s damages.      Answer D is incorrect. In the common law case of Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co., 35 F.2d 301 (4th Cir. 1929), the court held that the seller had a duty not to complete a bridge after the buyer repudiated. But UCC Article Two has a different rule, because unlike a completed bridge, completed goods can be resold to avoid or reduce loss.",

The woman and the driver settled the wrongful death action for $1 million. Subsequently, the driver was charged with reckless homicide of the husband. At the driver\u2019s criminal trial, the prosecutor offered, as evidence of the driver\u2019s guilt, the driver\u2019s statement to the woman during settlement negotiations.

Statements made in negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its enforcement authority may be admissible in a subsequent criminal case.

Because the fire marshal is a public official and his conclusion about the cause of the fire is a factual finding based upon an official investigation, the report is admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. The witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception, however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement must be excised from the report. Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under      a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation protects defendants only in criminal cases and so does not protect the neighbor in this civil action. Answer D is incorrect. Public officials may rely on bystander statements and hearsay in making factual findings.

Answer B is incorrect. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to probation revocation proceedings under FRE 1101(d), the rule governing lay opinion testimony is not applicable. Answer D is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to probation revocation proceedings under FRE 1101(d), and even if they did, the confidential informant\u2019s statement is in fact being offered for its truth\u2014to show the basis for revoking probation.",

The man has invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refuses to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial. The prosecutor calls the man\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who testifies that on the day of the fire, she noticed that the man seemed nervous and asked him what was wrong.

Answer A is incorrect. FRE 613(b) permits proof of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence so long as the witness has an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Here, the girlfriend had that opportunity and denied the statement, making proof of the statement by extrinsic evidence permissible. Answer B is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a judgment on the pleadings may be made after the pleadings are closed. However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be premature.",

The man denies fault for the decedent\u2019s death. At trial, the executor\u2019s only witness testifies that shortly before the accident he was riding 50 feet behind the man and saw the man rapidly approaching the decedent until they were only a few feet apart. This witness briefly looked away, heard an unusual noise, and immediately afterward saw the decedent and the decedent\u2019s bike on the ground. The man calls three witnesses, none of whom had met the decedent or the man before. Two riders testify that they were riding parallel to the man and never saw his bike touch the decedent\u2019s bike.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

As the state-law claim remains to be decided in the action, there is not yet a final judgment on the merits of the entire action, and thus an appeal is not allowed under the final judgment rule. Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Answer C is incorrect. To obtain a discretionary interlocutory appeal, the party seeking to appeal must apply to both the district and appellate courts to meet the statutory standards. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Because the scientist has appealed without attempting to satisfy that requirement, the appeal cannot be treated as a discretionary interlocutory appeal. Answer D is incorrect. Under the final judgment rule, a judgment is not final until all the claims in the action have been resolved. While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

Ten months ago, the son asked the father to sign some tax documents related to the apartment building and slipped in among the documents a deed that conveyed the building to the son. The father did not read the documents before signing them because he trusted his son. After the father signed the deed, the son promptly recorded it. Five months ago, the son sold the building to an investor, who promptly recorded her deed. The investor was unaware of the circumstances surrounding the conveyance of the building from the father to the son. Two months ago, the father died survived by his wife and his son. The father\u2019s duly probated will, executed five years earlier, devised the apartment building to his wife. Is the wife entitled to ownership of the apartment building?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the father\u2019s actual signature is on the deed to the son.\nB. No, because the investor was a bona fide purchaser without knowledge of the son\u2019s dishonesty in obtaining the deed from his father.\nC. Yes, because the father executed the will before he signed the deed to the son.\nD.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC.

Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect. The desire to bring a foreclosure action does not create a right to accelerate a mortgage. Rather, the right to accelerate depends upon whether a term of a mortgage has been breached.

Two years later, at a time when the land remained vacant, the developer took out a second mortgage loan from an investor to construct self-storage units on the land. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order in which they were executed. The developer made all payments on both mortgage loans for several years but eventually defaulted on the loan from the seller, who threatened to initiate foreclosure proceedings. To avoid the foreclosure, the developer executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure conveying the land back to the seller. But before the developer delivered the deed to the seller, it notified the investor of the proposed conveyance and gave her the option to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan. The investor declined to do so, and the developer delivered the deed to the seller. If nothing else has happened since the conveyance to the seller, is the investor\u2019s mortgage still valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the investor declined to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan.\nB. No, because the seller\u2019s mortgage was a purchase money mortgage.\nC.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other. Which party is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because a default will be implied by the court under these facts.\nB. The bank, because the man violated the terms of the mortgage.\nC. The man, because he is current on his mortgage payments and property insurance premiums.\nD. The man, because the bank\u2019s collateral has not been impaired and in fact has been enhanced.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by deed\u201d or \u201cafter-acquired property.\u201d Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple to the purchaser (the son\u2019s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired it from the son.      Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death. Answer C is incorrect. Here again, the daughter did not purport to convey a life estate to the purchaser and even if she had, it would have terminated at her death. Answer D is incorrect.

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire. Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is possible that a third party wrongfully let the cattle out of the pen.\nB. No, because the trucker must submit direct evidence of negligence in order to invoke the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.\nC.

The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a finished product by the product\u2019s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the component is what rendered the finished product defective. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 5 (1998). In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer A is incorrect. The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met). Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer D is incorrect. The mere knowledge that the sand needed to be properly mixed with water and cement to make sound concrete is not sufficient to render the distributor liable for an injury caused by the defective concrete.",

The question is not about the standard of care applicable to the doctor and the store, but rather whether the store, if found negligent, can be held responsible along with the doctor not only for the shopper\u2019s initial injury but also for the worsening of the injury as a result of the doctor\u2019s malpractice. Answer B is incorrect. The mere fact that the doctor\u2019s malpractice happened after any possible negligence on the part of the store does not defeat the imposition of liability on the store for the worsening of the shopper\u2019s injury caused by the doctor\u2019s malpractice.

Intrusion upon seclusion is one of the four privacy torts recognized by the Second Restatement of Torts and most states. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A\u2013E (1977). Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the company did not expressly authorize the security officer\u2019s specific actions does not necessarily allow it to avoid liability. The security officer was an employee of the company, and the company both directed the officer to investigate the woman and provided the officer with her phone number.

The woman\u2019s breach of the noncompetition agreement, if any, would not prevent a reasonable jury from concluding that the company is liable to the woman for intrusion upon seclusion.

Prior to setting off a charge, the blasting company supervisor posted a large warning sign and stationed a flagman to stop automobiles along the highway. Although a motorist saw and understood both the sign and the flagman\u2019s instruction to stop, the motorist nonetheless continued past the flagman and the sign and was traveling along the highway at the moment of the blast. A flying rock from the blast hit and severely damaged the motorist\u2019s car. The jurisdiction follows the traditional common law rules governing contributory negligence and assumption of risk. If the motorist pursues a claim against the blasting company to recover for the damage to the car, and all the foregoing facts are established, how much should the motorist recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The full value of the car.\nB. The full cost of restoring the car to its condition just before the accident.\nC.

Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle. The supervisor told the dispatcher that he should quit if he couldn\u2019t handle the increased hours. Over the next three months, the dispatcher continued to complain about the working conditions, to no effect. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury. He eventually was hospitalized and had to miss several months of work as a result of the emotional distress. The dispatcher sued the trucking company for negligence.

Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

In this case, the only harm suffered by the farmer was lost revenue, and strict products liability does not apply when a defective product causes only economic loss, as opposed to personal injury or property damage. Answer B is incorrect. The problem is not the manufacturer\u2019s lack of knowledge about the farmer\u2019s contracts but the rule that prevents an injured party from recovering for purely economic loss caused by a defective product. Answer C is incorrect. The statement is true, but it does not entitle the farmer to damages. The contract law rule of consequential damages is irrelevant to the resolution of a tort claim. Answer D is incorrect. Because the farmer has suffered only economic loss, he cannot recover on a strict products liability theory.",

Under the sponsorship agreement, the dealership was required to arrange for licensed and trained emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to be present during the race. The dealership contracted with a licensed and reputable emergency medical services (EMS) firm that supplied EMTs for events such as these. A motorcyclist participating in the race was injured when he lost control of his motorcycle. The motorcyclist was treated at the scene by the EMTs. In removing the motorcyclist\u2019s helmet, one of the EMTs twisted the motorcyclist\u2019s neck, causing him to become permanently paralyzed. The motorcyclist has sued both the EMS firm and the dealership, alleging that the EMT\u2019s careless conduct caused his paralysis. Assuming the validity of the motorcyclist\u2019s negligence claim against the EMS firm, which of the following best characterizes the dealership\u2019s potential liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The dealership is directly liable for hiring the EMS firm.\nB. The dealership is vicariously liable, because it owed a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care for the race.\nC. The dealership is vicariously liable, because the EMT was careless in the course of her employment.\nD. The dealership is neither directly liable nor vicariously liable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is also no basis for direct liability.
