Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "D is correct. The state has a legitimate interest in encouraging the development of its natural resources, and this law rationally relates to that interest. Thus, it is constitutional. A is incorrect because there is no taking of property without just compensation. There is no permanent loss of any rights by any of the owners. Instead, there is a redistribution of rights among the remaining owners. B is incorrect because the law does not unduly burden interstate commerce in oil and gas production. The law does not impose any additional burden on out-of-state producers. Instead, it simply affects the way in which the interests are held by the owners. C is incorrect because property inheritance is not a privilege created by state law. It is a right protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."

It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

The mayor\u2019s threat to not allow the owner to pave any more roads in the town unless he removed his bumper stickers violated the owner's rights under the First Amendment. The amendment protects the owner's freedom of speech and association, and it prohibits the town from enacting laws that impair his rights. Here, the town did just that when the mayor said that if the owner did not remove the bumper stickers, he would not be allowed to pave any roads in the town again. By threatening to not allow the owner to do work for the town unless he removed the bumper stickers, the mayor was telling the owner that he could not associate with certain people and that he had to speak in a certain way. Because of this, A is the best answer. B is incorrect because the right being impaired is the owner's freedom of speech and association, not his right to protection from discrimination. C is incorrect because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder for all contracts. Here, the road construction projects were let by the mayor, who has the authority to select the contractor for the job. D is incorrect because allowing people to work for the town does not require that they support its current administration.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements.

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

In this case, the state constitution has been interpreted to mean that the state will not allow a debtor to exempt property that the debtor has not held for a period of time sufficient to establish a permanent residence. Therefore, Congress cannot enact a federal statute that contradicts the state constitution, and C is the best argument because it addresses the constitutionality of the federal statute in light of the state constitution. A is incorrect because automobile negligence is not a commercial activity, and is therefore not beyond the scope of Congress's commerce clause power.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss. While the city\u2019s motion was pending, the city council passed an emergency ordinance requiring both prior notice and property owner consent before the removal or replacement of any electric meter.

Once the city enacted an ordinance requiring both notice and consent, the dispute over the merits of that ordinance was no longer justiciable because it could not be resolved by the court. Therefore, because the controversy over the merits of the ordinance could not be resolved by the court, there is not yet a final judgment to be reviewed, and the case is not ripe for appeal. A is incorrect. Capable of repetition yet evading review is not an appropriate exemption to the mootness doctrine for this reason: the exemption is meant to apply to situations in which the injury is caused by the very action the plaintiff is suing over, and here, the harm is not being inflicted by the action the plaintiff is challenging (the meter replacement). B is incorrect. Here, the city\u2019s voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct will not suffice to keep the case from being moot because the dispute over the merits of that ordinance was not yet ripe for decision.

By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory.

Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest.

Many political groups have contributed to that increase with their growing use of billboards to display messages that further a variety of political candidates and public causes. The city council has received many complaints from residents claiming that the billboards are ugly and detract from picturesque sights along the roadways. In response to these complaints, the city council has enacted an ordinance that substantially limits the number and the size of billboards that may be erected along designated scenic roadways. A company that owns many of the billboards affected by this ordinance has filed suit, claiming that the ordinance violates the company\u2019s freedom of speech. Should the court uphold the ordinance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the ordinance burdens political speech and is not necessary to further a compelling government interest.\nB. No, because the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum.\nC.

The government may regulate the content of speech in a variety of ways, as long as that regulation is designed to serve a substantial government interest and is narrowly tailored so that there are alternative avenues of expression open. Ugliness and the potential for distraction from the roadway are substantial government interests. Therefore, the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest, and it does not violate the First Amendment. A is incorrect because the government has not substantially restricted the company\u2019s ability to express itself through other means. B is incorrect because the area around the roadways is not a designated public forum. D is incorrect because the regulation of the use of the roadways is reasonable, given the substantial government interest at stake."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking.

The smell of burning marijuana coming from inside the apartment told the officers that someone was inside and possibly burning drugs."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. In Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency. Here, the police lawfully knocked and announced their presence at the door. That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the police conduct\u2014knocking and announcing their presence\u2014was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.",

Under the facts of this case, capital murder is the most serious crime for which the man can properly be convicted. B is incorrect.

In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A.

In this case, the police collected extensive historical data that was stored in the cloud--the cell-phone provider maintained the data remotely, and it was not incriminating in nature.

Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data.

The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

It convicted him of second-degree murder, which is not a lesser included offense of first-degree murder. Under the law of most states, a jury that is instructed to consider a lesser included offense must also be instructed to consider the original charge, and a jury that is instructed on both is not \"effectively acquitting\" the defendant of the original charge if it convicts the defendant of the lesser included offense. B is incorrect. The vindictive-prosecution doctrine applies to dismissing a first appeal after the defendant has been convicted, not to retrying a defendant for the same crime. C is incorrect. It is not true, as a general rule, that a defendant who seeks a lesser charge must be granted that instruction. In capital cases, however, the Supreme Court has held that a capital defendant must be allowed to argue for a lesser included offense instruction, even if he or she did not request it. D is correct. The jury never returned a verdict on the first-degree murder charge because the defendant did not testify and thus did not have the opportunity to be specific about which verdict he wanted.

Federal law provides the defendant with the right to discovery of exculpatory material, and this right applies even if the material is not specifically listed in federal rules. B is incorrect.

Also, the agreement does not state that the parties intend for the UCC to apply, so the UCC will not be applied if the parties' intent is clear."

The man's obligation to pay for the lessons was subject to the condition precedent that he survive for at least two months after the contract was signed.

An offer does not lapse merely because the offeree dies; it lapses only if the offeror dies as well. When the man died, his estate became solely responsible for paying for the lessons. B is incorrect. Under the UCC, as interpreted by most courts, the man's death did not discharge his obligation to pay for the lessons because the contract was not self-executing.

However, where one party's performance requires a period of time (such as the arborist's cutting down the trees), that performance is due before the other party is obligated to perform unless the contract specifies otherwise. In this case, the property owner-arborist contract did not address how long the arborist had to complete the cutting down of the trees. Under the constructive condition, the arborist was not obligated to continue cutting trees after the first day, and the property owner was not obligated to pay for services that were not rendered. However, the arborist was not discharged from his duty to perform; rather, he was merely excused from the obligation to continue performance due to the constructive condition. Because the arborist did not complete performance, the property owner is entitled to damages (in this case, the $10,000 agreed-upon price for the services the arborist did render). B is incorrect. Restitutionary damages are the amount necessary to put the other party in the position he would have been in had the contract been fully performed. However, because the contract was not fully performed, restitutionary damages are not applicable. C is incorrect. Under the doctrine of frustration of purpose, a contract may be discharged if performance becomes impossible or unreasonably burdensome due to circumstances that could not have been anticipated by the parties at the time they entered into the contract. However, in this case, the frustration of purpose would not apply because the arborist was not excused from completing the performance; rather, he was merely excused from the obligation to continue performance due to the constructive condition.

The $15,000 payment was in exchange for the subcontractor\u2019s promise to perform under the original agreement, and therefore was supported by consideration as well. When a party seeks to enforce a promise made in exchange for a benefit conferred on a party under an earlier agreement, the party may not benefit from the original agreement's consideration unless the party gave consideration in exchange for the benefit conferred on the party. In this case, the general contractor gave no consideration in exchange for the subcontractor\u2019s promise to perform under the original agreement. Therefore, the $15,000 payment is unenforceable. B is incorrect. The analysis in this question assumes that the subcontractor\u2019s mistake was not unilateral. If it was, the subcontractor would not be entitled to equitable relief, and the $12,000 payment would be the only possible recovery. C is correct. Under the UCC, a seller may not enforce a contract modification that is not supported by consideration unless the modification is fair and equitable under the circumstances.

The promise that the applicant sought to enforce was for a one-year job position that would begin on January 2 and pay $65,000 per year. Because the position was for a term of more than a year and for pay of more than $500, the employer's offer fell within the statute of frauds and therefore was not enforceable unless the applicant's acceptance of the job and performance for two weeks somehow removed the application of the statute of frauds.

Under the doctrine of divisible contracts, a court will treat a contract that is not in its nature a single, indivisible unit as if it were a number of contracts, and will excuse performance only on the part that cannot be separated from the remainder of the agreement without altering its essential terms. In this case, the contract is divisible into four parts: the man's promise to pay $60,000 each time the contractor hit a specified performance milestone. Because each of these promises is separable from the other, and because each is for a distinct consideration, the contractor is entitled to recovery $60,000 each time he hit a milestone. Thus, A is incorrect. C is incorrect because restitution would only apply if the contractor had not relied on any payment from the man. Since the contractor had relied on the man's promise to pay $60,000 when the foundation was laid, restitution would not apply. D is incorrect because willfulness only applies to the man's duty to pay the contractor's reasonable expenses incurred in completing the house after the man's repudiation of the contract.

This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The seller's expectation that it would be able to resell the machine for $92,000 is important because it indicates that the seller's damages are consequential rather than direct. Under the UCC, a seller must make reasonable efforts to resell goods that the seller has made but not delivered to the buyer when the buyer repudiates the contract. The seller's expectation that it would be able to resell the machine for $92,000 indicates that the seller's efforts to resell were reasonable. Therefore, the $8,000 difference between the seller's expected profit and the amount it actually received from the third party is the seller's damages. Under the UCC, the seller may keep the $8,000 as damages even though it did not have a specific contractual right to that amount. B is incorrect. The seller's anticipated profit is not the same as lost profit, particularly when the seller has resold the goods. C is incorrect. The $40,000 amount includes the $30,000 the seller had already spent on production before the buyer repudiated the contract. D is incorrect.

The ledger can be admitted through the codefendant\u2019s testimony, but not through the officer\u2019s testimony. The codefendant\u2019s testimony is the better choice because he is the one who can provide the necessary foundation for the admissibility of the ledger. As the defendant\u2019s drug supplier, the codefendant was in a position to know whether the ledger recorded drug transactions. In contrast, the officer\u2019s testimony is irrelevant because it is not the type of business record that is kept in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity.

The ledger is not a business record because it was not kept in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity.

The ledger is a purchase and sales journal, which is a business record, but it does not qualify for admissibility through testimony by a records custodian. D is incorrect. The business records exception to the hearsay rule applies to illegal activity as long as the activity is a regular part of the operation of the business.

When offered by the prosecution, the driver\u2019s statement to the woman is a statement of an opposing party, and therefore it would come within the exception to the hearsay rule set out in FRE 801(d)(2)(A). Answer C is incorrect. FRE 408(a)(2) distinguishes between settlement negotiations involving private parties and those involving a public office. Statements made in negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its enforcement authority may be admissible in a subsequent criminal case.

Because the fire marshal is a public official and his conclusion about the cause of the fire is a factual finding based upon an official investigation, the report is admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. The witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception, however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement must be excised from the report. Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under      a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation protects defendants only in criminal cases and so does not protect the neighbor in this civil action. Answer D is incorrect. Public officials may rely on bystander statements and hearsay in making factual findings. To the extent that a public official\u2019s factual findings rest on only such hearsay, those findings could be excluded for a lack of trustworthiness under FRE 803(8)(B).

The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The roommate\u2019s testimony is improper character evidence because it is irrelevant to any of the parties\u2019 interests and it could lead to unfair suggestion of propensity or bias. The defendant\u2019s use of cocaine, even if it is relevant to his ability to concentrate on studying for finals, has nothing to do with his ability to conform his behavior to the law, or with his mental state for the charged crime. Thus, it is inadmissible. B is incorrect because prior bad acts cannot be used to prove the defendant\u2019s lack of a required mental state unless the bad acts involve the same method of operation as the charged crime. In this case, the bad acts involve the use of illegal drugs, which are different from the use of methamphetamine to manufacture drugs for distribution. Therefore, they cannot be used to prove the defendant did not have the required mental state for the charged crime. C is incorrect because intent is not an element of the crime in this case. It is a presumption that applies only if the defendant has no adequate defense. In this case, the defendant has raised the defense of duress, which negates the presumption of intent. If the defendant\u2019s defense is successful, he will not have the presumption of intent, and the testimony is inadmissible. D is incorrect because prior experience with drugs is not probative of the defendant\u2019s knowledge for the charged crime. In addition, the prior experience could lead to an inference of bias or propensity on the part of the defendant, which would be unfair."

As a statement of fact, it is specific enough that the brother\u2019s statement can be tested for its trustworthiness by looking at the surrounding circumstances.

A is incorrect because the availability of a witness is not a sufficient corroborating circumstance to allow the statement to be admitted without first being challenged. B is incorrect because the hearsay exception for statements against interest applies in civil cases as well as criminal cases. C is incorrect because the brother\u2019s statement does not expose him to criminal liability.

In civil cases, the exception applies only to statements that would subject the speaker to criminal sanctions.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a judgment on the pleadings may be made after the pleadings are closed. However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be premature.",

The man denies fault for the decedent\u2019s death.

This witness briefly looked away, heard an unusual noise, and immediately afterward saw the decedent and the decedent\u2019s bike on the ground. The man calls three witnesses, none of whom had met the decedent or the man before. Two riders testify that they were riding parallel to the man and never saw his bike touch the decedent\u2019s bike.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

While \u201cgood cause\u201d is the standard for amending a pretrial order under Rule 16(b), the higher \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d standard applies once the court enters the final pretrial order under Rule 16(e).",

Because the man made no affirmative representation regarding the existence of the restriction in the deed he sold to the woman, and because the man made no subsequent acknowledgment of the existence of the restriction, the promise to include a restriction in any deed to the easterly tract will be strictly construed. Thus, whether the entrepreneur is bound by the restriction depends upon whether the deed he received was the first deed to be written for that tract of land. If the deed to the entrepreneur was the first deed written for that land, then the man's promise to the woman will be given effect and the restriction will be binding on the entrepreneur. If, however, there were other deeds written for that land before the man wrote his deed to the entrepreneur, then the man's promise will be given no effect, and the restriction will not be binding on the entrepreneur.

At issue is whether the entrepreneur had record (constructive) notice of the restriction. If so, the entrepreneur would not be a good-faith purchaser for value. Courts are divided about whether a buyer is required to search deeds outside of the chain of title to the land the buyer is purchasing. Here, the deed from the man to the woman is outside of the entrepreneur\u2019s chain of title even though they share a common grantor. Thus, knowing whether the jurisdiction\u2019s law puts a buyer on notice of all land transfers of the buyer\u2019s grantor, even those outside of the chain of title, is essential. If it does, the entrepreneur had a duty to search the title for the westerly tract. Answer A is incorrect. The type of index does not determine what instruments are in the chain of title.

Although some courts have created such a duty, the majority have not, and thus C is the best choice. A is incorrect. The UCC \u201cas is\u201d clause is a defense, not an unconscionability clause. Moreover, the facts indicate that the buyer was not fooled by the \u201cas is\u201d clause and still bought the house despite knowing nothing about its condition. D is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. A warranty deed provides protection for title issues, not issues of physical condition. Answer D is incorrect. The merger doctrine is irrelevant.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it.

The neighbor rebuilt the cabin in a new location, as required by the local building code, and now wants to access the cabin from the east side of the man\u2019s land.

The man\u2019s land remains vacant. Does the man have the right to stop the neighbor from relocating the easement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the location of the easement was not fixed in the original grant.\nB. No, because the neighbor would not have asked to relocate the easement if her cabin had not been destroyed by fire.\nC.

            "explanation": "A is correct. An easement by necessity is an interest in land that is for the benefit of one party (the \"dominant estate\") and burden to another party (the \"servient estate\"). It allows the holder to pass from one property to another over a specified route or area, even if that route or area is not part of either property. An easement by necessity arises where the most convenient or usual access to a public road or highway is blocked by a project that was not there when the road was built. In this case, the man\u2019s land abuts a public road. Although the man\u2019s land is vacant, it is the most convenient or usual access to the public road. Therefore, a right of way over the vacant land is an easement by necessity, and the neighbor had the right to use it even if it was not specifically identified in the deed. Because the location of the easement was not specifically identified in the deed, it was not \"fixed\" (A is correct) and the neighbor can relocate it as long as the new location is reasonably convenient for the neighbor's use. B, C and D are incorrect."

Two years later, at a time when the land remained vacant, the developer took out a second mortgage loan from an investor to construct self-storage units on the land. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order in which they were executed. The developer made all payments on both mortgage loans for several years but eventually defaulted on the loan from the seller, who threatened to initiate foreclosure proceedings. To avoid the foreclosure, the developer executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure conveying the land back to the seller. But before the developer delivered the deed to the seller, it notified the investor of the proposed conveyance and gave her the option to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan. The investor declined to do so, and the developer delivered the deed to the seller. If nothing else has happened since the conveyance to the seller, is the investor\u2019s mortgage still valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the investor declined to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan.\nB. No, because the seller\u2019s mortgage was a purchase money mortgage.\nC.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Under the doctrine of seniority, mortgages on a property are prioritized based on their timing of recording. The investor\u2019s mortgage is senior to the seller\u2019s mortgage because it was recorded before the seller\u2019s mortgage. Although the seller\u2019s mortgage was senior to the investor\u2019s, it was not a purchase money mortgage (one taken out to finance the purchase of the property). Therefore, the seller could not foreclose on the investor\u2019s mortgage, even though the seller had the right to foreclose on the seller\u2019s mortgage. Instead, the seller could only require the developer to bring the investor\u2019s mortgage along with the seller\u2019s mortgage in any sale of the property. When the developer conveyed the property back to the seller via a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the seller brought both mortgages with her when she went to the title company to purchase title insurance. The investor\u2019s mortgage was senior to the seller\u2019s mortgage, and the seller could not remove it from the title. Thus, A is incorrect. B is incorrect because the seller\u2019s mortgage was not a purchase money mortgage. C is incorrect because, although it is true that a deed in lieu of foreclosure does not eliminate junior mortgages, the facts indicate that the investor\u2019s mortgage has been paid off."

A mortgagor\u2019s later-executed mortgage generally can be extinguished only by foreclosure. Thus, the holder of the senior lien (the seller) should have searched the title to determine if a junior lien existed and, if so, brought a foreclosure action to extinguish it rather than accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Answer A is incorrect. The status of the investor, the junior lienholder, is not affected by that lienholder\u2019s failure to cure the mortgagor\u2019s default. Answer B is incorrect. The general rule that a deed in lieu of foreclosure does not extinguish subsequent mortgages is unaffected by whether the senior lien was a purchase money mortgage or not. Answer D is incorrect.

The buyer financed the purchase, in part, with a $250,000 loan from a bank, secured by a mortgage on the house. Before the closing, the buyer\u2019s attorney advised him to purchase a standard-form, $300,000 title insurance policy naming the buyer as the insured. Because the buyer had forgotten to bring his checkbook to the closing, his son, who had accompanied him to the closing, paid the premium for him. One year later, the buyer died. Under his will, the house passed to his son. Two years later, the son was successfully sued by a previous record owner with a superior title to the house. The previous owner\u2019s claim had not been excepted in the buyer\u2019s title insurance policy through the carelessness of a title company employee. At the time of the lawsuit, the house was still subject to the bank\u2019s mortgage. The son immediately sought indemnification for the loss from the title insurance company. Is the son entitled to indemnification from the title insurance company?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the son was not named as an insured on the title policy.\nB. No, because when a mortgage remains outstanding, a title policy protects only the mortgagee from any loss.\nC. Yes, because the house passed to the son under the buyer\u2019s will.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The son is entitled to indemnification from the title insurance company because he paid the premium. Under a title insurance policy, the insurance company will pay for any loss suffered by an insured, up to the amount of the policy\u2019s face value, if that loss occurs as a result of a claim that is not a matter of public record at the time the policy is issued. In this case, the previous owner\u2019s claim was not a matter of public record at the time of the issue of the policy. However, the previous owner\u2019s interest was superior to the buyer\u2019s (and the son\u2019s) interest, so the son suffered a loss as a result of the lawsuit against him. Therefore, D is the best choice. A is incorrect. The son was not named as an insured in the title policy because he was not the owner of record at the time the policy was issued. However, as the beneficiary of the buyer\u2019s will, the son was legally entitled to the property upon the buyer\u2019s death, and was thus an intended beneficiary of the buyer\u2019s insurance policy. Thus, the son was in fact an insured under the policy. B is incorrect. A mortgagee\u2019s interest is also insured against loss for lack of title, as long as the mortgagee was a party to the original policy. Here, the bank was the buyer\u2019s mortgagee and was, therefore, insured against loss for lack of title. However, the issue is not whether the bank\u2019s interest was insured, but whether the son\u2019s interest was insured. C is incorrect. Although the son inherited the property, he did not acquire it through the will. Instead, it was already in the son\u2019s possession at the time of the buyer\u2019s death."

            "explanation": "D is correct. Under the terms of the mortgage, the man agreed not to \"damage or impair\" the property or \"commit waste\" on the property. Although the man did not physically damage the warehouse he tore down, he did impair it by removing it. Furthermore, the man's actions might be interpreted as a waste of the property (depending on the language of the mortgage) if he removed the warehouse with the intent not to rebuild it or use the land for any other purpose. Under the terms of the mortgage, the bank had the right to accelerate the loan if the man breached the mortgage, and the bank did just that. However, the bank will not be able to foreclose unless it can prove that the man breached the mortgage and that the bank retained the power to foreclose. In addition, the foreclosure remedy must be tailored to the specific breach. In this case, the man did not breach the mortgage by failing to pay the accelerated amount due; rather, he breached by damaging the property. As such, the appropriate remedy would be a foreclosure by sale of the land, not a trustee's sale. Because the land has increased in value due to the man's actions, a trustee's sale would be inequitable."

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter.

Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death.

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire. Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Under the facts of this situation, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is applicable. The term \"res ipsa loquitur\" means \"the thing speaks for itself.\" It is used to describe situations where negligence clearly occurred and where lay people would say, \"I don't need a doctor to tell me what happened here; it's obvious that the defendant was negligent.\" The trucker does not need to provide specific evidence of negligence because the injury suffered by the trucker (damage to his truck and lost income due to time spent repairing the truck) is the type that would not ordinarily occur in the absence of the defendant's negligence. In addition, the fact that the cattle were able to escape from their pen suggests that the pen was not secure. Thus, D is the best choice. A is incorrect because it is possible that the farmer's employees were negligent in letting the cattle out of the pen, but this would not negate the applicability of the res ipsa loquitur. B is incorrect because it is not necessary for the trucker to provide direct evidence of negligence in order for the res ipsa loquitur to apply.

Answer A is incorrect. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and since the trucker did not contribute to the accident, the jury can infer that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect. The trucker needs to establish that the farmer was in exclusive control of the pen, that the accident would not have occurred but for negligence, and that the accident was not due to the trucker\u2019s own actions.

The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year.

Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability.

The principal informed the student\u2019s parents of the bus driver\u2019s report and told them that, because of the student\u2019s behavior, the student could not ride the bus for the next week and would have to be driven to school by a parent. The following Monday morning, after the bus driver had let the children off the bus in front of the school, but before she could close the door and drive away, the student\u2019s father pulled his car directly in front of her bus, blocking the driver\u2019s path. Because there was another bus right behind hers, the driver was unable to move her bus. The father got out of his car and strode toward the open door of the bus, screaming at the driver: \u201cYou messed with the wrong family! I am going to get you!\u201d Feeling threatened, the bus driver quickly closed the door. The father pounded on the door with enough force to dent it, screaming obscenities at the driver, until a school security guard intervened.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The father\u2019s threatening actions, coupled with his physical contact by banging on the bus door, have all the elements of a battery. A battery is the unlawful application of force to the person resulting in bodily injury or offensive touching, without consent or privilege. Here, the father unlawfully applied force by banging on the bus door, which caused the bus driver to be in fear of being hit by the door, and resulted in the injury of the bus door being dented. Assault is the attempt to commit a battery. However, for an assault to be actionable, there must be a reasonable apprehension of an attempted battery. In this case, there was no attempt to commit a battery, as the father did not come close to hitting the bus driver. Instead, the father\u2019s actions were those of a scared parent coming to the defense of his child. While his actions may have been extreme, they did not constitute an attempt to commit a battery, and therefore, there was no assault. Instead, the father\u2019s actions constitute a battery. Causing emotional distress is not a sufficient injury to sustain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Further, the student was not the one who was injured; it was the bus. Intentionally damaging someone else\u2019s property can be a sufficient injury for trespass to chattels, but in this case, the father did not act with intent to damage the bus. He was angry and lashed out. Therefore, A, D, and C are incorrect."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver. Even under the \u201cextended personality\u201d doctrine\u2014which, for example, allows a battery plaintiff to establish the necessary contact element if the defendant touches an article of clothing the plaintiff is wearing\u2014making contact with the bus is almost certain not to count as contacting the driver\u2019s person. Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect. The driver is not likely to be considered to have a possessory interest in the damaged bus, and therefore trespass to chattels would not be a viable claim.",

            "explanation": "C is correct. Because this is a pure question of negligence, and not a products liability question, the motorist's damages are limited to the value of the blasting company's negligence. That value can be measured by the cost of repairing the damage to the car, but only to the extent that the blasting company's negligence was the cause of the damage. Under the facts of this situation, the motorist is the proximate cause of his own injury, so the blasting company can only be held liable for the damage that would not have occurred but for the blasting company's negligence. That damage is equal to the cost of repairing the car to its condition prior to the accident, less the percentage of fault attributed to the motorist's negligence. Thus, A is incorrect. B is incorrect because the blasting company has not breached its duty of care, which would allow the court to award damages for the full value of the car. D is incorrect because the court can award damages, and it is for the court to determine whether recovery should be denied."

The motorist was fully aware that there was risk posed by the blasting company\u2019s activity and was instructed to stop, yet chose to proceed, thus assuming the risk of damage to the car as a result of the blasting.

Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle. The supervisor told the dispatcher that he should quit if he couldn\u2019t handle the increased hours. Over the next three months, the dispatcher continued to complain about the working conditions, to no effect. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury.

The court cannot yet determine whether the dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress that was severe enough to cause him to be hospitalized for a period of time, and whether this was a result of negligence on the part of the trucking company.

There is no evidence in the facts provided to support a conclusion that the supervisor failed to act with ordinary care. C is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Negligently caused emotional distress is ordinarily not actionable unless connected to a physical injury. Answer A is incorrect. Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty. As noted earlier, courts generally do not recognize a duty to take care against causing emotional distress unconnected to a physical injury. Answer D is incorrect.

At the time the manufacturer entered into the contract, it had already firmly decided to withdraw from the State A market in two years. Because the distributor had heard rumors of such a plan, its chief executive officer, before signing the contract, asked a representative of the manufacturer whether such a plan was in place.

            "explanation": "C is correct. When the manufacturer repudiated its contract with the distributor, the distributor was not justified in treaty breach because the manufacturer did not materially breach the contract. Instead, the distributor had a claim for fraud based on the manufacturer's misrepresentation that it did not have a plan to withdraw from State A. Under the UCC, a seller is not required to disclose facts that are not requested by the buyer, and a seller is not obligated to respond to rumors. Thus, A is incorrect. Under the facts of this case, a court would find that the manufacturer did not materially breach the contract, and that the distributor's claim for breach of contract would therefore fail. However, the distributor would have a viable claim for fraud based on the manufacturer's misrepresentation that it did not have a plan to withdraw from State A. Thus, C is the best answer. B is incorrect because the manufacturer misrepresented a material fact about its plans for the State A market. D is incorrect because the manufacturer's right to contract with other State A distributors was not a reason for the distributor to enter into the contract, and was not a reason for the distributor to rely on the manufacturer's representations.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. Because the dealership\u2019s duty of care was delegable, because the dealership was not negligent in hiring the EMS firm, and because the EMT was not an employee of the dealership, there is no basis for holding the dealership liable, whether directly or vicariously. Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is also no basis for direct liability. Answer B is incorrect. The duty to provide competent medical care was properly delegated to the EMS firm. Answer C is incorrect. Because the EMT was an employee only of the EMS firm, not the dealership, any carelessness by the EMT could be imputed only to the EMS firm.",
