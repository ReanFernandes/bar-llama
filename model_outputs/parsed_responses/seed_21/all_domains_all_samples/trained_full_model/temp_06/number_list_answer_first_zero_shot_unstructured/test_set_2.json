Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "D is correct. The law does not effect a taking because the state has not taken any property interest from the individual owners. Instead, the law merely alters the rights the owners have within the larger property right. Moreover, the law does not burden interstate commerce, because the interests at issue are state law created interests. Therefore, the law is rational to promote the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development. A is incorrect. Although the extinguishment of an interest may seem like a taking, such an extinguishment is not a taking as that term is used in the constitution. Likewise, the burden on interstate commerce is not a taking. B is incorrect. States have the authority to regulate their oil and gas interests, which are state created interests. C is incorrect. Property interests created by state law are not privileges, but rather property rights. States can create property rights, which is what the state has done here by creating these interests."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss. While the city\u2019s motion was pending, the city council passed an emergency ordinance requiring both prior notice and property owner consent before the removal or replacement of any electric meter.

While the type of injury to standing that will suffice for standing to sue is typically an injury that prevents or hinders an individual from seeking judicial relief, here the homeowner was injured in a way that prevented the homeowner from being able to seek judicial relief: the homeowner was arrested and prosecuted for his actions. B is incorrect. Voluntary cessation will not moot a case when an injury has occurred. Here, while the city has voluntarily ceased its illegal actions, the harm to the homeowner has already been done.

Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest.

Such restrictions must satisfy intermediate scrutiny: they must be necessary to further a compelling government interest and they must be narrowly tailored to achieve that purpose. The ordinance burdens political speech because it substantially reduces the number of political messages that can be displayed on billboards. And the ordinance does not satisfy intermediate scrutiny. The city cannot demonstrate that limiting political speech on billboards is necessary to further a compelling government interest. B is incorrect. A public forum is a public place where the public at large has a right to assemble and to speak on issues of public concern. The designation of public forums is intended to protect the freedom of speech by ensuring that the government cannot control the content of speech in such places. But the ordinance does not restrict political speech in a public forum. Rather, it is a content-neutral restriction of political speech. C is incorrect. The ordinance does not satisfy intermediate scrutiny. The city cannot demonstrate that limiting political speech on billboards is necessary to further a compelling government interest. D is incorrect. The ordinance is not a reasonable regulation of the use of public roadways.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

Answer B is incorrect. It is true that the ordinance prohibits conduct, but on these facts, the burning of the one-dollar bills was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, because the speaker intended the burning to communicate a message, and in context, the audience was likely to receive the message. In this situation, the ordinance satisfies the First Amendment not simply because it regulates conduct, but because it is content-neutral and it satisfies the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny.      Answer C is incorrect. Notwithstanding the absence of a fire risk here, there is no indication on these facts that the prosecution was a pretext for the government\u2019s disapproval of the speaker\u2019s message. The city has a legitimate interest in enforcing the permit requirement generally because of the risks associated with open fires in public places. Answer D is incorrect.

The Supreme Court has limited such forums to streets, sidewalks, and parks. Nor is there an indication on these facts that the city had dedicated the beach as a speech forum. Answer D is incorrect. These facts are not sufficient to prove that the city enacted the ordinance because officials disapproved of the message of the protesters.

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect.

            "explanation": "A is correct. In an emergency situation, where there are exigent circumstances that would justify a warrantless search, police may conduct a valid warrantless search if they have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and they have reason to believe evidence related to that crime is located in the place to be searched. Here, the police received reliable information that the woman was selling drugs from her apartment, which gave the police probable cause to believe a crime was being committed and evidence related to that crime was located in the apartment. Additionally, the police could not obtain a warrant because the information about the woman's drug selling was not in the public domain and could not be discovered by a public records search. Thus, A is correct and C is incorrect. B is incorrect. In an emergency situation, where there are exigent circumstances that would justify a warrantless search, police may conduct a valid warrantless search if they have reasonable suspicion and believe evidence related to that crime is located in the place to be searched. However, the information in B comes from a public records search, which would have provided the police with information that would have allowed them to obtain a warrant to search the woman's apartment. Therefore, B is incorrect. C is incorrect. In an emergency situation, where there are exigent circumstances that would justify a warrantless search, police may conduct a valid warrantless search if they have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and they have reason to believe evidence related to that crime is located in the place to be searched. Thus, C is incorrect. D is incorrect. It is the police officers' presence and actions that create the exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search, not the circumstances themselves. Thus, D is incorrect."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. In Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency. Here, the police lawfully knocked and announced their presence at the door. That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the police conduct\u2014knocking and announcing their presence\u2014was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.",

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v.

Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

Using an online directory that the resident had joined, the police obtained the resident\u2019s cell- phone number. The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB. No, because the subpoena was based on a cell- phone number that the resident had voluntarily placed in the public domain.\nC. Yes, because a subpoena must be based on probable cause.\nD.

The Fourth Amendment protects only reasonable expectations of privacy, and a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.

Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

In this case, the second man was convicted of felony murder for his role in the bank robbery and murder of the teller. However, the second man was not the actual shooter, and thus was not the intellectual equal of the actual shooter. Because the second man was not the actual shooter, and because he was intellectually disabled with an IQ of only 60, his death sentence would be unconstitutional. A is incorrect because it misstates the applicable law. The issue here is not whether the sentence imposed on the actual shooter was \"too light,\" but whether the death sentence imposed on the second man is disproportionate to his individual circumstances. Thus, A is incorrect both because it misstates the applicable law and because it answers the question incorrectly. C is incorrect because the second man being convicted of the bank robbery and the murder of the teller makes him responsible for the murder, and thus, the second man can be sentenced to death for the murder. However, because the second man was not the actual shooter and was intellectually disabled, his death sentence would be unconstitutional. Thus, C is incorrect because it misstates the applicable law. D is incorrect because it misstates the applicable law.

In a jurisdiction that allows for lesser included offenses instructions, a defendant may properly be convicted of a lesser included offense if the evidence supports it, but a conviction for a lesser included offense is considered an acquittal of the higher charge. Here, because the evidence at trial did not support a conviction of first-degree murder, but did support a conviction of second-degree murder, the conviction for second-degree murder effectively served as an acquittal of the first-degree murder charge, and the defendant cannot properly be retried on that charge. B is incorrect. There is no vindictive-prosecution doctrine, and it is proper for a defendant to be retried on a charge after a conviction on a lesser included offense. C is incorrect. Although a defendant may properly request a lesser included offense instruction, the conviction for the lesser offense does not negate the need for a fair trial on the original charge. D is incorrect. A jury may render a verdict for either acquittal or conviction on each charge, and need not render a verdict on each individual charge if the jury unanimously finds the party guilty on the overall charge.

Answer B is incorrect because the judge\u2019s job is not to weigh the evidence but is only to determine whether a reasonable jury could find adequate provocation. The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis.

Answer A is incorrect because, although generally discovery is governed by state rules, the due process clause contains some core rights, such as the right to disclosure of critical exculpatory evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the scope of due process is not limited to proof of actual innocence. The government must disclose any evidence favorable to the defendant that could affect the outcome of the case. Answer D is incorrect because the due process clause requires disclosure only if the evidence is significant enough to affect the outcome.

The instructor demanded that the man\u2019s estate pay for the 15 lessons. When the estate refused to pay, the instructor sued the estate. It is undisputed that the instructor was willing and ready to perform her obligations under the contract. Is the instructor likely to prevail in the action against the estate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because an offer lapses on the death of an offeror or an offeree.\nB. No, because the man\u2019s death excused both his and the instructor\u2019s performance obligations.\nC.

The party's estate must have knowledge of the contract and of the death, and the estate must have reason to know that the decedent was party to a contract.

A contract may be discharged on grounds of frustration of purpose where a party's performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. Such event may include the destruction of a specific thing necessary for the performance of a duty or the destruction of the only available source of supply of a necessary raw material. Because the trees on the owner's property were destroyed by fire, which was beyond the arborist's control and not his fault, the arborist's performance of cutting down the trees is discharged on grounds of frustration of purpose. Therefore, the owner is not obligated to pay the arborist anything. A is incorrect because the arborist's expectation interest is the amount the arborist expected to earn on his performance. Because the arborist did not complete his performance, there is no amount of recovery to which the arborist would be entitled. B is incorrect because the arborist's restitutionary interest would be the reasonable value of the services he rendered up until the time the contract was discharged. D is incorrect because although the arborist did not complete his performance, the owner would still be obligated to pay for the work the arborist did do."

After determining that other subcontractors would charge at least $18,000 for the work, the general contractor agreed in writing.

If the subcontractor prevails in a suit against the general contractor, how much will the subcontractor be likely to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $12,000, because the contract modification was not supported by consideration.\nB. $12,000, because the subcontractor\u2019s mistake was unilateral.\nC. $15,000, because the contract modification was fair and equitable under the circumstances.\nD. $18,000, because that is the value of the benefit the subcontractor conferred on the general contractor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Since the subcontractor was in error, this mistake operates to modify the contract. However, the modification will only be enforceable if it is fair and equitable, i.e. if it reflects the parties' understanding of the value of the work to be done. Therefore, C is the appropriate recovery. A is incorrect because consideration is not required for a unilateral mistake to operate to modify a contract. B is incorrect because a unilateral mistake can operate to modify a contract even if it is not the fault of one of the parties. D is incorrect because the value of the benefit conferred is not determinative of whether a modification will be enforceable."

Once the applicant commenced performance, there was nothing that the employer could have done to avoid being bound by her services. B is incorrect. Although the agreement could have been fully performed within a year, the fact that the position was for a one-year term suggests that the agreement was not meant to be a one-year employment contract but rather an offer for a trial period of one year.

The parol evidence rule does not allow the introduction of evidence to interpret a written contract, as the rule deems the written contract to be complete and exclusive of any prior understandings. Therefore, because the written contract was ambiguous as to the meaning of the term \"summer season,\" the parties' different understandings of that term will preclude the enforcement of the contract. A is incorrect because both parties cannot be in good faith if they attach different meanings to the same term. B is incorrect because the fishing company drafted the contract, but it did not draft the term \"summer season.\" Therefore, the meaning of that term will not be construed against the fishing company. C is incorrect because the fishing company does not get to take advantage of the fact that it is in the industry and re-write the contract to suit its understanding of the term.

An intended beneficiary can enforce a contract to which it is not a party, because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302. However, one party to the contract can assert, against the beneficiary, claims for breach by the other party to the contract.

Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 309(2). Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to do the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for damages against the bank, as an intended beneficiary.

Instead the bank is an intended beneficiary that can enforce a contract to which it is not a party because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary.

And even if the carpenter\u2019s breach was material, the bank could recover the value of the work done for the homeowner as restitution. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374.",

            "explanation": "B is correct. A claim for restitution generally will not be awarded where the claimant has relied on the breach, because reliance is inconsistent with a restitutionary theory of recovery. Here, although the man will lose some money because the contractor quit before completing the house, there was no reliance. Therefore, restitutionary principles support the contractor\u2019s recovery. A is incorrect. Although the contractor could argue that the man should be bound to the contract because the contractor relied on the man\u2019s promise to pay, reliance is inconsistent with a restitutionary theory of recovery. C is incorrect. Although generally a claim for restitution will not be awarded where the claimant has relied on the breach, this is not true where the reliance was only on the part of the obligee (the man). Here, the contractor was not injured by the man\u2019s reliance, so restitutionary principles support the contractor\u2019s recovery. D is incorrect. This answer correctly states that restitutionary principles support the contractor\u2019s recovery, but it misstates the rationale. Generally a claim for restitution will not be awarded where the claimant has relied on the breach, but this is not true where the reliance was only on the part of the obligee (the man).

A party that materially breaches a contract is nevertheless entitled to recover under a theory of restitution the amount of the value of the benefit that the breaching party\u2019s part performance conferred on the victim of the breach. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374. Answer A is incorrect. A breaching party cannot recover on a theory of reliance. Answer B is incorrect. This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 240. Answer D is incorrect. Contract law generally does not distinguish between willful breaches and other breaches. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374; Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 12.3. This situation would not require a court to consider the reason for breach.",

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The driver\u2019s statement to the woman is an admission of a party-opponent, which is specifically defined as non-hearsay. However, although an admission of a party-opponent is not hearsay, it can still be excluded as a violation of the attorney-client privilege. B is correct. A criminal defendant is not permitted to invoke the attorney-client privilege in a subsequent criminal prosecution for allegedly wrongful acts arising out of the conduct being investigated or prosecuted in the civil case. Here, because the woman and the driver settled their wrongful death action, the driver cannot invoke the attorney-client privilege in his criminal prosecution. C is incorrect. Although a statement made in civil settlement negotiations may sometimes be admissible in a subsequent criminal prosecution (usually when the defendant is charged with the same conduct giving rise to the civil action), that is not the situation here. Here, the woman and the driver settled their wrongful death action, so the driver cannot invoke the attorney-client privilege in his criminal prosecution. D is incorrect. Although the driver\u2019s statement to the woman is not hearsay, it is inadmissible because it is protected by the attorney-client privilege."

Under FRE 408(a)(2), statements made during settlement negotiations in a private civil action\u2014negotiations not involving a public office\u2014are inadmissible in a subsequent criminal case arising out of the same incident. Answer A is incorrect. When offered by the prosecution, the driver\u2019s statement to the woman is a statement of an opposing party, and therefore it would come within the exception to the hearsay rule set out in FRE 801(d)(2)(A). Answer C is incorrect. FRE 408(a)(2) distinguishes between settlement negotiations involving private parties and those involving a public office. Statements made in negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its enforcement authority may be admissible in a subsequent criminal case. But statements made in negotiations with a private party are not admissible in a subsequent criminal prosecution. Answer D is incorrect. The statement is inadmissible under FRE 408(b)(2).

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Because the fire marshal is a public official and his conclusion about the cause of the fire is a factual finding based upon an official investigation, the report is admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. The witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception, however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement must be excised from the report. Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under      a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation protects defendants only in criminal cases and so does not protect the neighbor in this civil action. Answer D is incorrect. Public officials may rely on bystander statements and hearsay in making factual findings. To the extent that a public official\u2019s factual findings rest on only such hearsay, those findings could be excluded for a lack of trustworthiness under FRE 803(8)(B). Here, the fire marshal\u2019s factual findings rest on his significant experience, as well as his examination of the scene, and would not be excludable solely due to reliance on some hearsay.",

One year later, a fire completely destroyed the woman\u2019s house and its contents, and she learned that the policy covered the cost of rebuilding the house but not the cost of replacing the contents. The woman sued the insurance company for breach of contract, claiming that when the agent sold her the policy, he did not notify her, as was legally required, that she would have to purchase a supplemental policy to cover the house\u2019s contents. At trial, the woman testified that the agent had not provided the required notice.

Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury.

One trial witness was a child who had seen one of the killings. Before calling the child to testify, the prosecution moved to remove the defendant from the courtroom, arguing that the child would be intimidated by seeing the defendant. The court denied the motion. When the child entered the courtroom to testify, the defendant became unruly, moving as though he was about to lunge from his chair toward the child. The judge warned the defendant to stop the behavior. After a second warning, the judge told the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to behave inappropriately. The defendant then shouted a threat at the child. At that point, the court ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom. When the child finished testifying, subject to full cross-examination by defense counsel, the defendant was allowed back into the courtroom. The trial concluded, and the jury convicted the defendant. The defendant appealed the conviction, challenging only his exclusion from the courtroom. Should the court of appeals reverse the conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a defendant may be excluded from the courtroom to protect a minor witness from further trauma.\nB. No, because the right to be present can be forfeited by disruptive behavior.\nC.

However, if the court had determined that the defendant could be present without disrupting the proceedings, his exclusion would have been a violation of his constitutional rights and would require reversal of the conviction. Thus, Answer C is incorrect. A court may exclude a defendant from the courtroom to protect a minor witness from further trauma only if there is good cause to believe that the defendant's presence would intimidate the witness and that the exclusion is necessary to protect the witness. Here, the prosecution failed to provide the court with good cause to support its motion to exclude the defendant. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. Also, although a defendant's right to be present during the proceedings against him may be forfeited by disruptive behavior, exclusion of a defendant for disruptive behavior is only a remedy short of a reversal if the error is harmless.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The statement against interest exception to the hearsay rule is applicable in both civil and criminal cases. The exception applies when a declarant makes a statement that is so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest that it would be difficult for the declarant to have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. In this case, the brother's statement against interest is that he helped his father steal money from his employer. Because the brother is available to testify but will be hostile, the statement can be used only for impeachment. However, the statement meets the requirements for the statement against interest exception to the hearsay rule, so the statement should be permitted into evidence. Thus, Answer D is correct. A is incorrect because whether a statement is admissible as a statement against interest is not dependent upon whether the declarant is available to testify. B is incorrect because the exception applies in both civil and criminal cases. C is incorrect because the exception applies whether or not the statement exposes the declarant to criminal liability."

Although the statement is clearly against the brother\u2019s criminal interest, that is not a sufficient condition for admissibility. Unavailability of the brother, as the declarant, also needs to be established. Answer D is incorrect. The statement is inadmissible due to the brother\u2019s availability to testify.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Prior inconsistent statements, given by a witness who is subject to cross examination on the stand, can be used both for impeachment and as substantive evidence if they were given under oath and under penalty of perjury. Because the girlfriend\u2019s prior statement is inconsistent with her current testimony, it can be used to impeach her by showing that she misled the investigator. However, the statement is also admissible as substantive evidence to prove the time the defendant left the house on the day of the robbery. Thus, Answer A is incorrect because prior inconsistent statements can be used both for impeachment and as substantive evidence in certain cases. Answer B is incorrect because the statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the defendant left the house by 8 a.m. Rather, it is being offered to show that the girlfriend misled the investigator during her prior interview. Thus, the statement is admissible as impeachment evidence even though it would normally be considered hearsay. Furthermore, the statement is also admissible as substantive evidence to prove the time the defendant left the house on the day of the robbery.

Extrinsic evidence of the girlfriend\u2019s earlier statement may be admitted for the purpose of impeaching her direct testimony that the defendant was at home with her during the entire morning, since she was given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement.

Answer A is incorrect. FRE 613(b) permits proof of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence so long as the witness has an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Here, the girlfriend had that opportunity and denied the statement, making proof of the statement by extrinsic evidence permissible. Answer B is incorrect.

There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be premature.",

The man denies fault for the decedent\u2019s death. At trial, the executor\u2019s only witness testifies that shortly before the accident he was riding 50 feet behind the man and saw the man rapidly approaching the decedent until they were only a few feet apart. This witness briefly looked away, heard an unusual noise, and immediately afterward saw the decedent and the decedent\u2019s bike on the ground. The man calls three witnesses, none of whom had met the decedent or the man before. Two riders testify that they were riding parallel to the man and never saw his bike touch the decedent\u2019s bike.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

The attorney cannot successfully challenge the entry of default on the ground that he has a meritorious defense to the action, because he failed to plead his defenses or otherwise defend against the action during the time he had to do so. B is incorrect. An individual may not make a motion for relief from a default judgment after the statute of limitations for an action has run. Here, the company\u2019s complaint was filed on July 1. Under State A law, the statute of limitations for a defamation action is six years, and the company\u2019s complaint did not specify a shorter statute of limitations. Therefore, because the attorney has been more than six years since the commission of the alleged wrong, he is barred by res judicata from bringing this action. C is incorrect. The attorney is not challenging the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over the company, but rather its personal jurisdiction over him. D is correct. Nine days after being served with the summons and complaint, the attorney filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court entered a default judgment against the attorney before he had the opportunity to defend himself against the company\u2019s claim.

B is incorrect. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2-314(1), a district court may grant a certificate for an immediate appeal from the grant of a motion for summary judgment when the district court determines that the case raises an important question of law as to which there exists substantial ground for difference of opinion and that the appeal from the order might otherwise be rendered unjust. Therefore, the employees' federal-law claims are not so similar to the state-law claims that the district court could not determine whether there existed substantial ground for difference of opinion with respect to the federal-law claims. C is incorrect. Although a party may seek a certificate for an immediate appeal from a district court when there exists no justifiable reason to delay the appeal, doing so will not guarantee that the appeal will be granted.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it.

No, because the neighbor would not have asked to relocate the easement if her cabin had not been destroyed by fire.\nC.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The easement described in the facts is an express easement in gross. Unlike an easement appurtenant, which involves two plots of land, an easement in gross only involves one. The holder of an easement in gross has the right to enter the land to make repairs to the easement, but has no right to enter the land for any other purpose. Although the holder of an easement in gross may \"use\" the land to reach the easement, that use does not affect the holder's right to the easement. Therefore, the man may not prevent the neighbor from accessing the easement, because the neighbor is only coming to fix the easement. B is incorrect. The facts tell us that the neighbor used the easement regularly to access her cabin. Therefore, the destruction of the cabin was not the cause of the neighbor seeking to relocate the easement. C is incorrect. Because the easement is an express easement in gross, the man\u2019s gift of the easement did not require consideration. D is incorrect. Although the neighbor's use of the easement did fix the location of the easement in relation to the neighbor's cabin, it did not fix the location of the easement in relation to the man's land. Because the man owns the land, he has the right to decide what becomes of the easement."

In this case, the garbage disposal is not considered a fixture because it is not attached to the land, there were no arrangements between the buyer and the seller regarding it, and it is not useful to the land without the sink it is attached to. The dining room ceiling fan is also not considered a fixture because it is not attached to the land, there were no arrangements between the buyer and seller regarding it, and it is not useful to the land without the ceiling it is attached to.

Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order in which they were executed. The developer made all payments on both mortgage loans for several years but eventually defaulted on the loan from the seller, who threatened to initiate foreclosure proceedings. To avoid the foreclosure, the developer executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure conveying the land back to the seller. But before the developer delivered the deed to the seller, it notified the investor of the proposed conveyance and gave her the option to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan. The investor declined to do so, and the developer delivered the deed to the seller. If nothing else has happened since the conveyance to the seller, is the investor\u2019s mortgage still valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the investor declined to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan.\nB. No, because the seller\u2019s mortgage was a purchase money mortgage.\nC.

In this case, the seller's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage, which means that the investor's mortgage is a subordinate mortgage.

The buyer financed the purchase, in part, with a $250,000 loan from a bank, secured by a mortgage on the house. Before the closing, the buyer\u2019s attorney advised him to purchase a standard-form, $300,000 title insurance policy naming the buyer as the insured. Because the buyer had forgotten to bring his checkbook to the closing, his son, who had accompanied him to the closing, paid the premium for him. One year later, the buyer died. Under his will, the house passed to his son. Two years later, the son was successfully sued by a previous record owner with a superior title to the house. The previous owner\u2019s claim had not been excepted in the buyer\u2019s title insurance policy through the carelessness of a title company employee. At the time of the lawsuit, the house was still subject to the bank\u2019s mortgage. The son immediately sought indemnification for the loss from the title insurance company. Is the son entitled to indemnification from the title insurance company?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the son was not named as an insured on the title policy.\nB.

When the buyer died, his interest in the house ended, and his son\u2019s interest began. Therefore, the son was not a named insured under the policy, but he was the beneficiary of the buyer\u2019s interest in the policy. The title company should have indemnified the buyer for any losses he incurred as a result of a defect in title. When the buyer purchased the house, he did not do so with money he had inherited from his father. Rather, he used a loan from the bank to purchase the house. As such, the buyer had a mortgage on the property that had to be paid off before he could sell it. Therefore, the fact that the buyer was still paying off his mortgage at the time of his death is irrelevant to determining who held title. Because the buyer\u2019s son was the true owner of the house at the time of the lawsuit, and thus the true beneficiary of the title policy, C is the best answer. A is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s son was the insured under the policy, although he was not named in the policy. B is incorrect. The title policy would have protected the son from any loss due to title defects if he had not been forced to sell the property.

There are two reasons for this. First, the man has not yet applied for a variance.

The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business.

At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The land was held in fee simple by the father. At his death, he devised a life estate to his daughter and a vested remainder to his son. The daughter later conveyed her life estate to a purchaser. The son, no longer holding a remainder, could not convey it to the husband. Instead, the son transferred his entire interest in the land to the daughter, who owned both a life estate and a vested remainder. When the daughter died, her life estate ended and it automatically went to the holder of the remainder, who was the daughter's husband at the time of her death. Therefore, C is correct and D is incorrect. A is incorrect because the purchaser did not obtain a life estate pur autre vie. The son transferred his entire interest to the daughter. B is incorrect because the son's transfer to the daughter was a quitclaim deed, which is not a transfer of property but rather a release of interest."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by deed\u201d or \u201cafter-acquired property.\u201d Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple to the purchaser (the son\u2019s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired it from the son.      Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death. Answer C is incorrect. Here again, the daughter did not purport to convey a life estate to the purchaser and even if she had, it would have terminated at her death. Answer D is incorrect. Remainder interests are alienable.",

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire. Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is possible that a third party wrongfully let the cattle out of the pen.\nB. No, because the trucker must submit direct evidence of negligence in order to invoke the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.\nC.

            "explanation": "D is correct. This is a textbook example of a situation in which the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may properly be applied. The general rule is that a lay jury cannot determine the ultimate issue of negligence. However, in certain cases involving unexplained or unusual circumstances, a jury may be permitted to determine whether negligence has occurred. This is especially true where the unexplained or unusual circumstance seems to speak for itself. Here, the facts state that the farmer's cattle escaped their pen and wandered onto the road, where they were hit by the trucker. The trucker argues that the farmer was negligent in allowing the cattle to escape. Because the facts state that the farmer's pen was not very high, and that cattle generally would not escape a secure pen, the jury may determine that negligence did occur. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect. It may be true that a third party could have negligently allowed the cattle to escape the pen, but that would not preclude application of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine. The mere assertion that another possible defendant could be responsible does not preclude application of the doctrine. B is incorrect. While it is true that a claim based on res ipsa loquitur must necessarily rely on inference and circumstantial evidence, this does not mean that direct evidence of negligence is required. Here, the trucker has provided direct evidence that the farmer's pen was not very high. The inference that should be drawn from this evidence is that the farmer was negligent in failing to construct a higher pen. C is incorrect. The farmer is not strictly liable for any harm caused by his cattle. If the farmer was negligent in constructing the pen, however, he may be liable for any damages that were caused by the escape of his cattle."

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and the trucker did not contribute to the accident, so the jury is permitted to conclude that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. Answer A is incorrect. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and since the trucker did not contribute to the accident, the jury can infer that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect. The trucker needs to establish that the farmer was in exclusive control of the pen, that the accident would not have occurred but for negligence, and that the accident was not due to the trucker\u2019s own actions. Answer C is incorrect. Strict liability does not attach to raising cattle, which is not an abnormally dangerous activity.",

The rupture resulted from a defect in the tire that existed at the time it was sold by the manufacturer to a retailer, who sold it to the driver and installed it on her car. The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year. After discovering this memorandum, the driver\u2019s attorney filed a timely amended complaint, adding a claim for battery. The manufacturer has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the battery claim, based on the undisputed facts set out above. If no additional facts are provided to the court concerning the risk of tire rupture, should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care to prevent ruptures.\nB.

Therefore, the court will consider whether a reasonable manufacturer would have taken greater care to reduce the risk of harm to the consumer. Here, a reasonable manufacturer would not have marketed a tire with an undetectable defect that would cause a rupture in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires. B is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The driver might have a valid strict products liability claim against the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support a finding\u2014required for battery liability\u2014that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect.

The construction company mixed the sand with water and cement to make concrete. The distributor knew that an improper ratio of sand, water, and cement would result in defective concrete, but the distributor played no role in determining the ratio used by the construction company in mixing the concrete.

The principal informed the student\u2019s parents of the bus driver\u2019s report and told them that, because of the student\u2019s behavior, the student could not ride the bus for the next week and would have to be driven to school by a parent. The following Monday morning, after the bus driver had let the children off the bus in front of the school, but before she could close the door and drive away, the student\u2019s father pulled his car directly in front of her bus, blocking the driver\u2019s path. Because there was another bus right behind hers, the driver was unable to move her bus. The father got out of his car and strode toward the open door of the bus, screaming at the driver: \u201cYou messed with the wrong family! I am going to get you!\u201d Feeling threatened, the bus driver quickly closed the door. The father pounded on the door with enough force to dent it, screaming obscenities at the driver, until a school security guard intervened.

A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver. Even under the \u201cextended personality\u201d doctrine\u2014which, for example, allows a battery plaintiff to establish the necessary contact element if the defendant touches an article of clothing the plaintiff is wearing\u2014making contact with the bus is almost certain not to count as contacting the driver\u2019s person. Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect. The driver is not likely to be considered to have a possessory interest in the damaged bus, and therefore trespass to chattels would not be a viable claim.",

Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle. The supervisor told the dispatcher that he should quit if he couldn\u2019t handle the increased hours. Over the next three months, the dispatcher continued to complain about the working conditions, to no effect. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury. He eventually was hospitalized and had to miss several months of work as a result of the emotional distress. The dispatcher sued the trucking company for negligence. The company has moved for summary judgment, based on the undisputed facts set out above. Assume that there is no applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute.

Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient).

Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty.

The manufacturer knew that the distributor would, on the basis of the agreement, invest in an expansion of its distribution centers in State A in order to handle the distribution of the manufacturer\u2019s products to retail sellers in that state. At the time the manufacturer entered into the contract, it had already firmly decided to withdraw from the State A market in two years. Because the distributor had heard rumors of such a plan, its chief executive officer, before signing the contract, asked a representative of the manufacturer whether such a plan was in place. The representative denied the existence of any such plan.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",
