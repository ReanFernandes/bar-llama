The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn January, a teacher contracted with a summer camp to serve as its head counselor at a salary of $10,000 for 10 weeks of service from the first of June to the middle of August. In March, the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed. In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for that job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period as the summer camp.

The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier wrote the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed its latest audited financial statements to the supplier, as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the lumber supplier for breach of contract. Will the manufacturer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contract was unenforceable, since the manufacturer had not committed to purchase a definite quantity\nof lumber.\nB. No, because the supplier had reasonable grounds for insecurity and was therefore entitled to cancel the contract and\nrefuse to make any future deliveries.\nC.

Therefore, the supplier was entitled to condition resumption of deliveries on the manufacturer providing adequate assurance of due performance. The manufacturer's audited financial statements and credit report constituted adequate assurance, and the manufacturer's prompt action in providing them demonstrates that the manufacturer was serious about continuing to perform its obligations under the contract. A is incorrect. The parties did not contract for a definite quantity, but rather for an indefinite quantity. The supplier's refusal to resume deliveries would therefore constitute a wrongful repudiation of the contract, rather than its termination. B is incorrect. The supplier was not entitled to terminate the contract simply because it had reasonable grounds to worry that the manufacturer might not perform. Instead, the supplier was required to give the manufacturer an opportunity to provide adequate assurance of due performance before the supplier could terminate the contract. C is correct.

            "explanation": "D is correct. A discharge of a contractual obligation must be in writing to be enforceable, and the writing must be signed by the party to be charged. The landowner and the contractor may have orally agreed that the contractor was not obligated to pave the sidewalk, but there was no consideration for this discharge of the contractor's duty to pave the sidewalk, so the purported modification is unenforceable. A is incorrect. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written contract or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated written contract (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). The facts state that the contract is a written contract that integrates oral evidence of an agreement to waive the contractor's duty to pave the sidewalk. Therefore, the parol evidence rule bars the evidence of the oral modification. C is incorrect. The parol evidence rule does not bar extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement where the prior agreement does not contradict the terms of a final written contract but rather seeks to add to a completely integrated written contract. The facts state that the contract is a written contract that integrates oral evidence of an agreement to waive the contractor's duty to pave the sidewalk.

The accident history of the car would be material to the decision of a buyer. The seller's statement, taken in context, and in light of the seller's active steps to conceal evidence of the damage and repair, would be the legal equivalent of a statement that the car had not been in an accident.

One week after the chef was hired by the bakery, a hotel offered the chef a position as a restaurant manager at a salary of $2,500 a month. The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery. Is the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a contract for permanent employment would be interpreted to mean the chef could leave at any time.\nB. No, because the position the chef took with the hotel was not substantially comparable to the one she had agreed to\ntake with the bakery.\nC. Yes, because the chef's acceptance of a permanent position meant that she agreed to leave the bakery only after a\nreasonable time.\nD.

However, the position the chef had agreed to take with the bakery was a permanent position, and she had indicated on her employment application that she was seeking a permanent job. Therefore, the contract is interpreted to mean that the chef is only required to give the bakery a reasonable opportunity to rehire her before seeking other employment. In this case, two weeks is not a reasonable opportunity, and the chef is not bound to the contract. B is incorrect. The issue is not whether the position the chef took with the hotel is substantially comparable to the position she had agreed to take with the bakery. The issue is whether the chef's acceptance of a permanent position breached the implied right of first refusal. C is incorrect.

The car dealer subsequently sold an automobile to a buyer at a price of $10,000, payable at $1,000 per month beginning on June 1. The car dealer then asked the bank whether the bank would accept payments of $1,000 per month for 10 months beginning June 1, without interest, in payment of the debt. The bank agreed to that arrangement and the car dealer then directed the buyer to make the payments to the bank. When the buyer tendered the first payment to the bank, the bank refused the payment, asserting that it would accept payment only from the car dealer. On June 2, the bank demanded that the car dealer pay the debt in full immediately. The car dealer refused to pay and the bank sued the car dealer to recover the $10,000. In this suit, which of the following arguments best supports the bank's claim for immediate payment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The agreement to extend the time for payment was not in writing.\nB.

Under UCC \u00a7 2-305(2), a written contract that is silent as to consequential damages is presumed to limit recovery to the price of the goods. Since the written contract was silent as to consequential damages, the bottling company must prove its actual damages to recover more than the price of the goods. Since the bottling company is a merchant, its recovery will be limited to its anticipated loss, which is $40,000. A is incorrect.

If the mother and the son join as parties plaintiff and sue the tutor for breach of contract, how much, if anything, are they entitled to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $1,000, because all other damages could have been avoided by employing another equally qualified instructor.\nB. $55,000, because damages of that amount were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they contracted.\nC. Nominal damages only, because the mother was not injured by the breach and the tutor made no promise to the son.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. A breaching party is only liable for actual damages unless the breaching party is a professional adviser, in which case the breaching party is liable for all foreseeable damages. Although the mother and the son did not take affirmative steps to avoid the consequences of the tutor's breach, they did not hire a substitute instructor, which would have been a reasonable step to take in light of the facts that they knew that the tutor had breached and that the tutor had a duty to prevent the consequences of his breach. Therefore, the tutor is only liable for nominal damages, if anything. A is incorrect. While it is true that the mother and the son could have avoided all other damages by employing another equally qualified instructor, this fact does not support a conclusion that the mother and the son are entitled to recover only nominal damages. Instead, it means that the mother and the son must bear the burden of proving their actual damages. B is incorrect. While it is true that damages of $55,000 were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they contracted, this fact does not support a conclusion that the mother and the son are entitled to recover $55,000. Instead, it means that the mother and the son must bear the burden of proving their actual damages. C is incorrect.

At the same time, the builder told the landowner that the builder was \"tired of the construction business\" and would not even begin the other two structures. The landowner refused to pay anything to the builder. Is the builder likely to prevail in a suit for the agreed price of the first structure?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because substantial performance is a constructive condition to the landowner's duty to pay at the contract rate.\nB.

Yes, because the contract is divisible, and the landowner will be required to bring a separate claim for the builder's\nfailure to complete the other two structures.\nD.

Under the trade usage rule, if the parties' agreement is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and if the usage of either party is such that the trade will construe the contract as a whole, the trade usage will control the interpretation of the contract. Here, the parties' agreement is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation: the laundry company could interpret \"daily service\" to mean service every day of the week, or it could interpret \"daily service\" to mean service every day except Sundays. The trade usage rule dictates that the interpretation that controls is the one that the trade will construe as a whole. In this case, the trade usage rule supports the interpretation that \"daily service\" means service every day except Sundays. Therefore, B is incorrect. A is incorrect. The meaning that controls is not the meaning that the innkeeper attached to the words, but rather the meaning that the trade will construe as a whole.

On May 29, relying on his expectation that he would finish the work and have the homeowner's payment on June 1, the carpenter contracted to buy a car for \"$10,000 in cash, if payment is made on June 1; if payment is made thereafter, the price is $12,000.\" The carpenter completed the work according to specifications on June 1 and demanded payment from the homeowner on that date. The homeowner, without any excuse, refused to pay. Thereupon, the carpenter became very excited, suffered a minor heart attack, and, as a result, incurred medical expenses of $1,000. The reasonable value of the carpenter's services in remodeling the homeowner's home was $13,000. In an action by the carpenter against the homeowner, which of the following should be the carpenter's measure of recovery?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $10,000, the contract price.\nB. $11,000, the contract price plus $1,000 for the medical expenses incurred because the homeowner refused to pay.\nC. $12,000, the contract price plus $2,000, the bargain that was lost because the carpenter could not pay cash for the car\non June 1.\nD. $13,000, the amount the homeowner was enriched by the carpenter's services.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside Green, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in Green. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in Green. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in Green. The Green legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of Green from faulty science and to protect Green toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in Green of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in Green satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the Green law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it abrogates the obligations of the contracts between the other toy manufacturers and their Green outlets\nwho have agreed to sell their Martian toys.\nB. No, because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because it deals only with a local matter, the sale of toys in Green stores.\nD.

Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate against the out-of-state toy manufacturers, it has a purely discriminatory effect against them, and the state has less discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate interests cited in the law.

Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was \"to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats\" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser sued the county, claiming that the regulation has taken the purchaser's property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the county did not take title to the property from the purchaser.\nB.

The statute also provided that public proceedings must precede adoption of the standards, and that once they were adopted, the standards would be subject to judicial review.

The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state. When it adopted the law, the state legislature declared that its purpose was to reduce the risks of infection of local citrus crops by itinerant diseases that have been found to attack citrus fruit. A national association of citrus growers sued to have the state law declared unconstitutional. The association claims that the law is prohibited by the negative implications of the commerce clause of the Constitution. Which of the following is the best argument in favor of the state's effort to have this lawsuit dismissed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA man intensely disliked his neighbors, who were of a different race. One night, intending to frighten his neighbors, he spray-painted their house with racial epithets and threats that they would be lynched. The man was arrested and prosecuted under a state law providing that \"any person who threatens violence against another person with the intent to cause that person to fear for his or her life or safety may be imprisoned for up to five years.\" In defense, the man claimed that he did not intend to lynch his neighbors, but only to scare them so that they would move away. Can the man constitutionally be convicted under this law?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because he was only communicating his views and had not commenced any overt action against the neighbors.\nB. Yes, because he was engaged in trespass when he painted the words on his neighbors' house.\nC. Yes, because his communication was a threat by which he intended to intimidate his neighbors.\nD. Yes, because his communication was racially motivated and thus violated the protections of the Thirteenth\nAmendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice.\nB. No, because murder is a specific intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that they intended to kill.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice does not require the intent to kill; in some cases, there may be \"implied malice\" if there was gross or extreme recklessness to human life on the part of the defendant. In the question, the gang members are charged with murder for their role in the death of the informant. The gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant, and stabbed him in front of the other gang members. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. By doing nothing as the informant was being stabbed and slowly dying, the eight gang members have taken affirmative steps to aid and abet in the murder of the informant, and should be convicted of murder. A is incorrect. To be an accomplice, the defendant must have the intent that the crime be committed and aid or abet in the commission of the offense. Mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient for accomplice liability. Although the gang members were present when the murder occurred, there is insufficient evidence to show that they had the requisite intent that the informant be murdered. B is incorrect. Murder is a specific intent crime. To be convicted of murder, a defendant must have the intent to kill or the intent to inflict great bodily harm. There is insufficient evidence to show that the gang members had the requisite intent to kill the informant. However, as explained above, the gang members can be properly convicted of murder for their role in aiding and abetting in the murder of the informant. D is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility. Although the gang members may have been voluntarily intoxicated, there is sufficient evidence to show that they had the requisite malice aforethought to support a murder conviction."

Moreover, the officers did not have probable cause to believe that the woman was a part of the drug dealing that was occurring in the house until they saw her put her hands in her purse and then realized that she was trying to hide the drugs.

One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the license number of the driver's car. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her and the car, and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat of the car. Later it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding. The driver was charged with unlawful possession of heroin. Her attorney filed a motion to suppress the use as evidence of the heroin found in the car.

She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny it as to all photographs.\nB.

A court will only grant a motion to suppress evidence based on a Fourth Amendment violation if the violation actually prejudiced the defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment, and there is no indication here that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the Fourth Amendment. A court therefore would deny the motion to suppress as to the first set of photographs but grant it only as to the second set of photographs. The woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the federal interception statute, and this violation prejudiced the defendant's rights under the statute. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to suppress the second set of photographs. A is incorrect. The woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer did not violate the Fourth Amendment, so the court should deny the motion to suppress the first set of photographs. B is incorrect. The woman could not possibly have acted without probable cause, because she was acting at the direction of a federal law enforcement agency. C is incorrect.

The defendant is guilty of murder. Although he was properly acting in self-defense when he shot the neighbor twice, the defendant cannot properly claim self-defense after the neighbor has been shot twice and is lying quietly moaning on the floor.

A is incorrect. The defendant did not merely attempt to kill the neighbor; he actually did kill him. An attempted murder conviction would require a finding that the defendant did not actually kill the neighbor but that he should be convicted of murder anyway because he came very close to doing so.

In this case, the defendant did act with malice aforethought when he shot the neighbor twice. He is guilty of murder, not manslaughter. D is incorrect. The defendant is guilty of murder. He is not guilty of attempted murder because he actually killed the neighbor."

Robbery is the taking of personal property of another from the other's person by force or intimidation with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. The woman's threat of immediate harm to the clerk was sufficient to constitute the intimidation required for robbery. The woman's lie is irrelevant to the determination of the type of crime committed. A is incorrect. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of another person's property by someone who had lawful possession of it. The clerk was not the woman's employer, and the woman did not have a lawful obligation to return the money. B is incorrect. Obtaining property by false pretenses is obtaining the property of another through fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. The woman, however, did not misrepresent any fact, and her lie was not done with the intent to permanently deprive the clerk of the money. C is incorrect.

A week later, the clerk was at a gathering when she spotted the customer wearing the watch. She told him that he must either pay for the watch or give it back.

Robbery is defined at common law as the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. The customer, with the intent to permanently deprive the clerk of the watch, took possession of the watch by threat of force (the threat of violence was sufficient, since the customer could reasonably have been interpreted as having the ability to commit violence). The fact that the customer ultimately returned the watch does not change the fact that the taking occurred by threat of force. B is incorrect. Larceny is the taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Although the customer, with the intent to permanently deprive the clerk of the watch, took the watch from the clerk, it was for the purpose of keeping it rather than carrying it away. Therefore, the most serious crime the defendant committed is robbery, not larceny. C is incorrect. False pretenses is obtaining the possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation while intending to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Although the customer lied to the clerk, and although the customer's conduct caused the clerk to transfer the title to the customer, the most serious crime the defendant committed was robbery, not false pretenses. Robbery is a more serious offense than false pretenses. D is incorrect. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of another person's property by someone who has lawful possession of said property. Because the clerk had lawful possession of the watch, and because the customer converted it to his own use, the most serious crime the defendant committed was robbery, not embezzlement. Although the clerk's possession of the watch was lawful, the customer's taking of the watch was not, and the taking was done with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the watch."

He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions.

            "explanation": "B is correct. At common law, a conspiracy is defined as an agreement between two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful goal, or to accomplish some lawful goal by unlawful means. A co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. So long as there is an agreement among the conspirators to engage in a course of conduct, and the conduct constitutes a violation of some charge the defendant is being tried for, the defendant can be properly convicted of conspiracy. Since the evidence shows that the defendant agreed to engage in a course of conduct that constituted bank robbery, and since the robbers wore masks and gloves and stole the bank surveillance tapes, preventing identification of the robbers, the motion for a judgment of acquittal should be denied. A is incorrect. At common law, a conspiracy is not a specific intent crime. Rather, a co-conspirator need only agree to the general course of conduct, and need not agree to all of the objects of the conspiracy. Since the evidence shows that the defendant agreed to engage in a course of conduct that constituted bank robbery, and since the robbers wore masks and gloves and stole the bank surveillance tapes, preventing identification of the robbers, the motion for a judgment of acquittal should be denied. C is incorrect. Pretrial notice of an alibi is only required for a motion for a judgment of acquittal made at the close of the government's case. It is insufficient for a motion for a judgment of acquittal made at the close of all evidence. D is incorrect. The government is not constitutionally required to answer evidence elicited during its case-in-chief with evidence of its own.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landlord leased an apartment to a tenant by written lease for two years ending on the last day of a recent month. The lease provided for $700 monthly rental. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term, until he moved to a new job in another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his \"lease rights\" for the remaining nine months of the lease. The friend made the next four monthly $700 rental payments to the landlord. For the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left of the lease term. The landlord was on an extended trip abroad, and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until last week. The landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally, for $3,500 for the last five months' rent. What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the tenant and the friend are liable for the full $3,500, because the tenant is liable on privity of contract and the\nfriend is liable on privity of estate as assignee.\nB. The friend is liable for $1,400 on privity of estate, which lasted only until he vacated, and the tenant is liable for\n$2,100 on privity of contract and estate for the period after the friend vacated.\nC. The friend is liable for $3,500 on privity of estate and the tenant is not liable, because the landlord's failure to object to\nthe friend's payment of rent relieved the tenant of liability.\nD. The tenant is liable for $3,500 on privity of contract and the friend is not liable, because a sublessee does not have\npersonal liability to the original landlord.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAn investor purchased a tract of land, financing a large part of the purchase price by a loan from a business partner that was secured by a mortgage. The investor made the installment payments on the mortgage regularly for several years. Then the investor persuaded a neighbor to buy the land, subject to the mortgage to his partner. They expressly agreed that the neighbor would not assume and agree to pay the investor's debt to the partner. The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating in pertinent part \" . . . , subject to a mortgage to [the partner],\" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage. The neighbor took possession of the land and made several mortgage payments, which the partner accepted. Now, however, neither the neighbor nor the investor has made the last three mortgage payments. The partner has sued the neighbor for the amount of the delinquent payments. In this action, for whom should the court render judgment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The neighbor, because she did not assume and agree to pay the investor's mortgage debt.\nB. The neighbor, because she is not in privity of estate with the partner.\nC. The partner, because the investor's deed to the neighbor violated the due-on-sale clause.\nD. The partner, because the neighbor is in privity of estate with the partner.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance.

The recorded subdivision plan imposed no restrictions on any of the 10 lots. Within two months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to a buyer, by a deed that contained no restriction on the lot's use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner, on behalf of himself as the owner of the unsold lot, and on behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on Lot 1. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The doctor, because Lot 1 was conveyed without the inclusion of the restrictive covenant in the deed to the first buyer\nand the subsequent deed to the doctor.\nB.

The landowner, because the doctor, as a successor in interest to the first buyer, is estopped to deny that Lot 1 remains\nsubject to the zoning ordinance as it existed when Lot 1 was first conveyed by the landowner to the first buyer.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is correct. A gift may be made of real estate. To be valid, a deed of real estate must be signed by the donor and witnessed by at least two people who must attest to the donor's intent to make a gift. The homeowner properly executed a deed sufficient to convey his home to the nephew, and the homeowner handed the deed to the nephew's friend. Therefore, A is correct. B is incorrect. The recording of the deed would serve to validate the transfer and make it unconditional, but it would not constitute delivery of the deed. C is incorrect. A gift causa mortis is a gift made during a person's lifetime in contemplation of that person's death. Such a gift is void under the common law. Therefore, it is incorrect to suggest that the homeowner's death consummated a gift to the nephew. D is incorrect. A deed may be used to convey real estate as a gift or to make a will, but it cannot do both. If the deed is used as a will, the testator (the homeowner) must have had the intent to revoke the gift to the nephew."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA buyer validly contracted in writing to buy land from a seller. The contract had no contingencies and was silent as to risk of loss if there were damage to, or destruction of, property improvements between contract and closing, and as to any duty to carry insurance. As soon as the parties signed the contract, the seller (who had already moved out) canceled her insurance covering the land. The buyer did not know this and did not obtain insurance. A few days later, three weeks before the agreed closing date, the building on the land was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. There is no applicable statute. In an appropriate action, the buyer asserted the right to cancel the contract and to recover his earnest money. The seller said the risk of fire loss passed to the buyer before the fire, so the buyer must perform. If the seller prevails, what is the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Once the parties signed the contract, only the buyer had an insurable interest and so could have protected against this\nloss.\nB. The buyer's constructive possession arising from the contract gave him the affirmative duty of protecting against loss\nby fire.\nC. The seller's cancellation of her casualty insurance practically construed the contract to transfer the risk of loss to the\nbuyer.\nD.

The nephew has offered to return the $10,000 to the woman. Who has title to the land?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The nephew, because at the time of the deed to the woman, the uncle was the owner of record.\nB. The nephew, because the woman did not conduct a title search.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The woman has title to the deed. Estoppel by deed is a doctrine that applies when a party (the donee) acquires title to land through a deed from a party (the donor) who had the title but who represented to the donee that he had no title and who induced the donee to rely on the donor's representation and to accept the deed. In this case, estoppel by deed would apply to the nephew and the woman. The uncle had represented to the nephew that he (the uncle) had no title to the land and induced the nephew to rely on his (the uncle's) representation and to accept the deed. The nephew then conveyed the land to the woman. The woman did not conduct a title search and promptly and properly recorded her deed. Therefore, estoppel by deed applies to both the nephew and the woman, and the woman is the owner of the land. A is incorrect. At the time of the deed to the woman, the record title holder was the nephew, not the uncle. The woman should not be charged with notice of this transfer simply because she did not conduct a title search. B is incorrect. While it is true that the woman should have conducted a title search, mere negligence on the part of the woman in not conducting a title search is insufficient to give title to the nephew. The woman is not charged with notice simply because she did not conduct a title search. D is incorrect. While it is true that recording a deed prior to the death of the owner will prevent unintentional conveyance of land, it will not give title to a donee who relied on the owner's misrepresentations regarding his ownership of the land."

On nights of athletic events, the woman and her family members wore earplugs and could not sleep or enjoy a quiet evening until after 10 p.m. In addition, light from the stadium on those nights was bright enough to allow reading a newspaper in the woman's yard.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The woman is seeking damages for the private nuisance caused by the school district's actions. A private nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of one's land. The facts indicate that the actions of the school district have caused a substantial, unreasonable interference with the woman's use and enjoyment of her land. The woman has not been evicted; rather she is seeking damages for the harm to her property caused by the actions of the school district. A is incorrect because the woman has not been evicted. Instead, she is seeking damages for the harm to her property caused by the actions of the school district. The facts indicate that the actions of the school district have caused a substantial, unreasonable interference with the woman's use and enjoyment of her land. C is incorrect because this is not a public nuisance case. A public nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with the health or property of the public at large. The facts indicate that the actions of the school district have caused a substantial, unreasonable interference with the woman's use and enjoyment of her land. Therefore, it is a private nuisance case. D is incorrect because there has been no waste of the property. To constitute a waste, a party must take possession of the land and use it in a manner that is substantially different than the way in which it was used by the owner. The facts indicate that the woman continues to possess and use her land in the same manner as before the actions of the school district."

            "explanation": "B is correct. A license is permission to use the land of another. It is revocable, and is not subject to the statute of frauds. In this case, because the neighbor had the landowner's permission to use the road and did not expend any money, property, or labor pursuant to the agreement, the neighbor was licensee who was free to assign his rights to use the road to the neighbor. When the neighbor assigned his right to use the road to the neighbor, he assigned an assignable license. Although the neighbor could theoretically have assigned an assignable license that was indefinite in duration, in practice a license is assigned for a specific period of time. When the grantee conveyed the land, she acquired whatever rights the landowner had in the neighbor's use of the road. Because the neighbor's use of the road was a license that was effectively assigned to the neighbor, the grantee acquired a right to terminate the neighbor's use of the road. A is incorrect. Although a license is usually orally communicated, it does not have to be in writing to be valid. In any event, the neighbor's use of the road for three years estops the grantee from terminating the neighbor's use of the road. C is incorrect. Estoppel applies when parties contractually agree that one party will not terminate the other party's use of the land. There is no evidence that the landowner and the neighbor ever agreed that the neighbor could assign a right to use the road to the neighbor. D is incorrect. The neighbor's use of the road was open and notorious when the grantee purchased the land, but mere occupancy of land, even if it is open and notorious, does not give rise to a right to use the land. To establish a right to use the land, the neighbor would have had to have obtained the landowner's express permission to use the road."

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn a civil trial arising from a car accident at an intersection, the plaintiff testified on direct that he came to a full stop at the intersection. On cross-examination, the defendant's lawyer asked whether the plaintiff claimed that he was exercising due care at the time, and the plaintiff replied that he was driving carefully. At a sidebar conference, the defendant's lawyer sought permission to ask the plaintiff about two prior intersection accidents in the last 12 months where he received traffic citations for failing to stop at stop signs. The plaintiff's lawyer objected. Should the court allow defense counsel to ask the plaintiff about the two prior incidents?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions does not bear on the plaintiff's veracity and does not\ncontradict his testimony in this case.\nB. No, because there is no indication that failing to stop on the recent occasions led to convictions.\nC. Yes, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions bears on the plaintiff's credibility, since he claims to\nhave stopped in this case.\nD. Yes, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions tends to contradict the plaintiff's claim that he was\ndriving carefully at the time he collided with the defendant.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The intent of the question is to test the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation on the one hand, and the quality of the community on the other. If the witness hasn't heard about the falsification, he might not be very plugged in to the community and so might be a poor reputation witness. On the other hand, if the witness answers \"yes,\" then the jury might infer that the community in which the defendant has a reputation for complete honesty may be setting the honesty bar pretty low. In either case, the alleged falsification is probative impeachment whether or not it occurred. Note that the courts require that the cross-examiner must have a good faith belief that the event actually occurred before inquiring into the act on cross-examination. In this case, that good faith standard is met by the evidence presented at the sidebar conference that the defendant was disciplined in medical school.",

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched; but if the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character and to the extent of damages.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The doctor's letter is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff's condition was caused by working conditions. As such, it is hearsay, and it is inadmissible under the rules of hearsay because it does not meet the requirements for any exception. However, if the doctor's letter is being offered only to show that the plaintiff's condition existed, and not for the truth of what the doctor asserted, then it would be admissible as nonhearsay under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. To meet the requirements of the business records exception, the doctor's letter must be a record of regularly recorded conduct, which was made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, and it must be kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity. The doctor's letter is a record of the doctor's diagnosis of the plaintiff's condition, which was made at the time the doctor learned of the plaintiff's condition, and the doctor obtained the information from the plaintiff. Therefore, C is correct. A is incorrect. The doctor's letter is hearsay, but it qualifies as an exception to the hearsay rule. The doctor's letter is admissible as a record of regularly recorded conduct, which was made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge. B is incorrect. The doctor's availability is irrelevant to determining whether the doctor's letter is admissible as a record of regularly recorded conduct. The fact that the doctor is available for cross-examination does not make the doctor's statement nonhearsay. In addition, even if the doctor were unavailable, the statement would still be admissible as a record of regularly recorded conduct. C is a better answer. D is incorrect. The doctor's letter does not qualify as a business record under the exception to the hearsay rule. To qualify as a business record, the record must be made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge.

In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case.

The car owner's argument that she was not negligent because she did not intend to get ice on the street and therefore did not violate the statute is a fact question for the jury. B is incorrect. The judge should deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because the jury may consider the statutory violation as evidence that the car owner was negligent, but it is not the only evidence that the jury may consider. C is incorrect. The judge should deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because the pedestrian has offered more than just evidence of the statutory violation. The pedestrian has offered evidence that she fell on the ice and was injured. The jury should be allowed to decide whether the car owner's actions were the proximate cause of the pedestrian's injuries. D is incorrect.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

While the delivery driver was looking for a telephone to summon a tow truck, thieves broke into the delivery truck and stole $350,000 worth of goods. The delivery company sued the construction company to recover for the $350,000 loss and for $1,500 worth of damage to its truck. The construction company stipulated that it was negligent in failing to place warning lights around the trench, and admits liability for damage to the truck, but denies liability for the loss of the goods. On cross-motions for summary judgment, how should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Therefore, the facts are disputed, and the court should not render a judgment for the estate. B is incorrect. The estate cannot win simply by rebutting the plaintiff's evidence. It must introduce its own evidence to establish that the decedent was not negligent. C is incorrect. The facts indicate that crossing the median is a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries. Therefore, the type of accident is not a sufficient basis for finding negligence as a matter of law. In addition, the facts indicate that the decedent violated the statute, so the statute is not a necessary element of the claim."

The court has adopted the pure comparative negligence doctrine, with joint and several liability, in place of the common-law rules relating to plaintiff's fault.

While a claim for trespass might only be for compensatory damages, a claim for injunctive relief is available in a trespass action where the plaintiff is in legal possession of the land."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA bright nine-year-old child attended a day care center after school. The day care center was located near a man-made duck pond on the property of a corporation. During the winter, the pond was used for ice skating when conditions were suitable. At a time when the pond was only partially frozen, the child sneaked away from the center and walked out onto the ice covering the pond. The ice gave way, and the child fell into the cold water. He suffered shock and would have drowned had he not been rescued by a passerby. At the time of the incident, the pond was clearly marked with signs that stated, \"THIN ICE - NO SKATING.\" When the child left the day care center, the center was staffed with a reasonable number of qualified personnel, and the center's employees were exercising reasonable care to ensure that the children in their charge did not leave the premises. The jurisdiction follows a rule of pure comparative negligence. In a suit brought on the child's behalf against the corporation, who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The child, because the corporation owes a duty to keep its premises free of dangerous conditions.\nB. The child, because the pond was an attractive nuisance.\nC. The corporation, because the danger of thin ice may reasonably be expected to be understood by a nine-year-old child.\nD. The corporation, because the day care center had a duty to keep the child off the ice.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The corporation has a duty to keep its premises in a reasonably safe condition, to conduct active operations with reasonable care for the presence of its invitees, and, under limited circumstances, to protect its invitees against the foreseeable harmful/dangerous conditions on its premises. The facts indicate that the corporation had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition on its premises and failed to take reasonable steps to protect its invitees from the danger. Therefore, A is correct. B is incorrect. While the pond may have been an attractive nuisance, the day care center had a duty to keep its invitee safe from the dangerous condition on its premises, and it failed to do so. Therefore, B is incorrect. C is incorrect. While it may be argued that the corporation had a duty to post signs in a language that the child could read, the child would still be entitled to bring a claim against the corporation based on its failure to keep its premises in a reasonably safe condition. Therefore, C is incorrect. D is incorrect. While the day care center may have had a duty to keep its invitees off of the ice, it failed to do so and therefore is not the proximate cause of the child's injuries. Therefore, D is incorrect."

            "explanation": "C is correct. The facts tell you that this is a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction. Therefore, the key to answering this question is to determine whether the child was contributorily negligent. Contributory negligence is an all-or-nothing rule; either the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, in which case he is barred from recovery, or he was not contributorily negligent, in which case he may recover damages. To determine whether the child was contributorily negligent, you must compare the child's conduct to that of a reasonable person in the child's position. The facts tell you that the day care center was exercising reasonable care in supervising the children, and that the child was under the care of the day care center at the time of the accident. Therefore, the child's conduct must be compared to that of a reasonable child his age. A reasonable child his age would not have left the care of the day care center to go out onto the ice, so the child was contributorily negligent and will lose his claim. A is incorrect. The facts tell you that the day care center was exercising reasonable care in supervising the children, and that the child was under the care of the day care center at the time of the accident. Therefore, it was not the day care center's fault that the child left its care. B is incorrect. The facts tell you that the day care center was exercising reasonable care in supervising the children, and that the child was under the care of the day care center at the time of the accident. Therefore, it was not the day care center's fault that the child walked out onto the ice. D is incorrect. The facts tell you that the day care center was exercising reasonable care in supervising the children, and that the child was under the care of the day care center at the time of the accident.
