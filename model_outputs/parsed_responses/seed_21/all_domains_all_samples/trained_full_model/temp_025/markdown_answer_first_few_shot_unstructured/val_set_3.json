The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA homeowner was using a six-foot stepladder to clean the furnace in his home. The homeowner broke his arm when he slipped and fell from the ladder. The furnace had no warnings or instructions on how it was to be cleaned. In a suit by the homeowner against the manufacturer of the furnace to recover for his injury, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the danger of falling from a ladder is obvious.\nB. No, because the homeowner should have hired a professional to clean the furnace.\nC. Yes, because the furnace did not have a ladder attached to it for cleaning purposes.\nD. Yes, because the lack of warnings or instructions for how to clean the furnace made the furnace defective.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Vehicles made by the manufacturer of the motorist\u2019s car have been found to be negligently designed, making them dangerously prone to rolling over when they suffer blowouts. A truck driver who was driving behind the motorist when the accident occurred stopped to help. Rescue vehicles promptly arrived, and the truck driver walked along the side of the road to return to his truck. As he approached his truck, he was struck and injured by a speeding car. The truck driver has sued the manufacturer of the injured motorist\u2019s car. Is the truck driver likely to prevail in a suit against the car manufacturer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the car manufacturer\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of the truck driver\u2019s injuries.\nB. No, because the truck driver assumed the risk of injury when he undertook to help the motorist.\nC. Yes, because it is foreseeable that injuries can result from rollovers.\nD.

This is a classic res ipsa loquitur situation. The facts show that the accident would not have occurred except for the negligence of the manufacturer, and that the manufacturer should be held responsible for all reasonably foreseeable injuries. A is incorrect. The proximate cause of the truck driver\u2019s injuries was the negligence of the car manufacturer. The car manufacturer made a dangerously designed product, and it is foreseeable that injuries to a rescuer could result from its negligence. B is incorrect. Voluntarily assisting a stranger is a non-commercial activity that is done for public good, so it does not fall under the scope of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine. C is incorrect. While it is foreseeable that injuries could result from a rollover, it is not foreseeable that a passerby would be injured in this way.

No, because the farmer had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief.\nC. Yes, because the farmer should have posted a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. While the farmer might have had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief and could therefore use reasonable force, the force here was excessive in relation to any potential threat the child posed. The farmer should have realized that a 10-year-old child could not possibly pose a threat of bodily harm to himself or others, and that it was unnecessary to use any force whatsoever, much less a hard enough blow to break her nose. A is incorrect. The child can state a claim for battery regardless of whether the farmer used deadly force, because the force was applied with intent to cause bodily injury. B is incorrect. The farmer may have had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief, but he would still be liable for battery because the force he applied was excessive. C is incorrect. Failure to post a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign would be relevant if the child was a trespasser, but it would not be a determinative factor in this case because the child was not a trespasser and the farmer would still be liable for battery despite probable cause."

When the neighbor came over the fence, the rancher shot him, inflicting serious injury.

To justify the use of deadly force, a defendant must have more than a subjective suspicion that he himself is threatened with harm; he must have a reasonable belief that he is threatened with harm. In this case, the rancher's belief that the neighbor was armed was not reasonable, and thus, his use of a gun was not justifiable. A is incorrect. The majority of states follow the \"castle doctrine,\" which provides that a person may use deadly force to protect his home or property from intruders, even if the person could retreat to a place of safety. However, the castle doctrine does not apply in this case because the rancher was not in his home and was not using deadly force to protect his home; he was using deadly force to resolve a property dispute. B is incorrect. While it is possible that the rancher could have a battery claim against the neighbor based on his intentional use of a deadly weapon, the rancher's belief that the neighbor was armed would be a defense to such a claim. C is incorrect. While a property owner may use reasonable force to protect his property from intruders, deadly force is almost never reasonable in such cases."

            "explanation": "B is correct. To bring a claim for defamation, a plaintiff must establish the following common law elements: (i) defamatory language, (ii) publication of that language by the defendant to a third person, and (iii) damage to the plaintiff's reputation. Here, the parties agree that the language is defamatory, and that it was published by the editor. The issue is whether the editor honestly believed that the accusation was true. If the editor did not believe the accusation to be true, then the editor is liable for defamation because the accusation was false and was injurious to the candidate's reputation. However, if the editor honestly believed the accusation to be true, then the editor may not be liable for defamation. This is because, under the \"New York Times\" standard for honest belief, the editor would not be held liable if he or she could demonstrate that the accusation was a reasonable inference based on the available facts. Thus, B is correct. A is incorrect. While it is true that the accusation may have been an opinion, the accusation was also a statement of fact. Further, the accusation was false. Thus, the editor published a false statement of fact about the candidate, and is thus liable for defamation. C is incorrect. While calling someone an illegal drug user may be considered defamatory per se in some jurisdictions, this is a civil case, and the callous editorial does not fit the definition of defamatory per se under the applicable law. D is incorrect. While it is true that false statements may be defamatory per se, here the statement is a mixed statement of fact and opinion. Further, the statement is false. Thus, the editor published a false statement about the candidate, and is thus liable for defamation."

When the tenant arrived at the leased premises on July 1, the tenant learned that the previous tenant had not vacated the premises at the end of her lease term on May 31 and did not intend to vacate. The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession. The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The cousin then entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to an investor with the closing to take place \u201cone week after [the cousin\u2019s] next birthday.\u201d The man failed to convey the farm to the cousin on her birthday. One week after the cousin\u2019s birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin\u2019s inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise.

After the mother\u2019s death and with the daughter\u2019s permission, the son took sole possession of the farm and agreed to pay the daughter a stipulated monthly rent.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The man took a deed to his attorney and told the attorney to deliver the deed to the nephew upon the man\u2019s death. The man also told the attorney to return the deed to him if he asked. None of these instructions to the attorney were in writing, and the deed was not recorded. The man then e-mailed the nephew informing him of the arrangement. Shortly thereafter, the nephew died testate. In his will, he devised the farm to his daughter. Several years later, the man died intestate, survived by two sons. The nephew\u2019s daughter immediately claimed ownership of the farm and demanded that the attorney deliver the deed to her. Must the attorney deliver the deed to the daughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a gratuitous death escrow is void unless supported by a written contract.\nB. No, because the man never placed the deed beyond his control.\nC. Yes, because the death of the nephew rendered the gratuitous death escrow irrevocable by the man.\nD. Yes, because the deed to the nephew was legally delivered when the man took it to his attorney.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "B is correct. When the man delivered the deed to his attorney with instructions to deliver it to the nephew on his death, he was attempting to create a valid death escrow. To create a valid death escrow, however, the man had to place the deed beyond his control, reserving no power over it once it had been given to the attorney. Because the man instructed the attorney to return the deed to the man if he asked, the man never placed the deed beyond his control, and it remained part of his estate after his death. Therefore, the death escrow was void. There is no applicable statute that might provide a basis for a contractual relationship between the man and the attorney. A is incorrect. There is no requirement that a gratuitous death escrow be supported by a written contract. In any event, the man and the attorney did not have a contract because the man never placed the deed beyond the attorney's control. C is incorrect. The death of the nephew had no effect on the validity of the death escrow because it was a gratuitous escrow and not a valid contract. D is incorrect.

Twenty years ago, the businesswoman conveyed the vacant tract to a grantee by a warranty deed that the businesswoman signed but the grantee did not. The deed contained a covenant by the grantee as owner of the vacant tract that neither he nor his heirs or assigns would \u201cerect any building\u201d on the vacant tract, in order to preserve the view of the river from the commercial building on the improved tract. The grantee intended to use the vacant tract as a nature preserve. The grantee promptly and properly recorded the deed. Last year, the businesswoman conveyed the improved tract to a businessman. A month later, the grantee died, devising all of his property, including the vacant land, to his cousin. Six weeks ago, the cousin began construction of a building on the vacant tract. The businessman objected and sued to enjoin construction of the building. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The businessman, because the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project.\nB.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The businesswoman and the grantee created a valid equitable servitude. An equitable servitude is a restriction on the use of a particular piece of land that is imposed on a particular piece of land and that lasts indefinitely. The promise or covenant that creates the equitable servitude must be in a writing that is signed by the party to be charged (the grantee in this case). The promise or covenant that creates the equitable servitude must also be in a writing that is signed by the party to be charged (the businesswoman in this case). The businesswoman and the grantee satisfied all of the requirements for creating an equitable servitude, so the servitude is valid. The grantee is bound by the covenant that the businesswoman made, and he is required not to build on the vacant tract. The cousin is attempting to build on the vacant tract and is thus a third-party beneficiary of the businesswoman's deed to the grantee. As such, the cousin is bound by the covenant that the businesswoman made. A is incorrect. The mere fact that the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project does not mean that the businessman automatically has a right to continue to use the vacant tract as it was used before the cousin's construction project. The businessman must still demonstrate that he is a third-party beneficiary of the businesswoman's deed to the grantee in order to have the right to enjoin the cousin's construction project. C is incorrect. An equitable servitude does not terminate automatically upon the death of the promisor (in this case, the grantee). Instead, an equitable servitude is a contractual obligation that lasts indefinitely and is binding on the grantee's heirs and assigns. D is incorrect. The fact that the grantee did not sign the deed does not invalidate the deed or the equitable servitude it created. A deed that creates an equitable servitude must be signed by the party to be charged (the grantee in this case), but it does not need to be signed by the party charging (the businesswoman in this case)."

A neighbor who owned the property immediately adjacent to the land wrongfully began to possess the land at that time. For 24 of the next 25 years, the neighbor planted and harvested crops on the land, hunted on it, and parked cars on it. However, in the sixth year after he first took possession of the land, the neighbor neither planted crops nor hunted nor parked cars on the land because he spent that entire year living in Europe. The neighbor built a small gardening shed on the land, but he never built a residence on it. When the daughter was 28, she was declared mentally incompetent and had a conservator appointed to oversee her affairs. Since then, she has continuously resided in a care facility. The applicable statute of limitations provides as follows: \u201cAn ejectment action shall be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues, but if the person entitled to bring the cause of action is under age 18 or mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues, it may be brought by such person within 10 years after attaining age 18 or after the person becomes competent.\u201d If the daughter\u2019s conservator wins an ejectment action against the neighbor, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The buyer purchased a title insurance policy running to both the buyer and the bank, showing no liens on the property other than the buyer\u2019s mortgage to the bank. Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances. As a result of a title examiner\u2019s negligence, this mortgage was not disclosed in the title insurance policy issued to the buyer and the bank.

            "explanation": "D is correct. A variance permits a waiver from a zoning requirement. A variance will be granted when an owner convinces a zoning appeals board that without the variance the owner would suffer a hardship regarding the use of the land. In this case, the board approved the woman\u2019s application to operate a court-reporting service in her house. This approval was not a variance, but rather a determination that the woman was entitled to use her house as she proposed because her use of the house was a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use is the continuation of a use of a structure or the land that was legal and existed before zoning was enacted and that would be prohibited by the zoning ordinance if the structure or use were to continue. Because the woman\u2019s house was in a zone that was later revised to prohibit commercial use and because the woman has continuously used her house for residential and commercial use, the woman\u2019s use of her house is a nonconforming use. The board\u2019s approval of the woman\u2019s proposal to operate a court-reporting service is equivalent to a determination that the woman is entitled to use her house as she proposed because her use of the house is a nonconforming use. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect. A variance permits a waiver from a zoning requirement. In this case, the board did not grant a variance, but rather determined that the woman was entitled to use her house as she proposed because her use of the house was a nonconforming use. Therefore, a variance was not needed. B is incorrect. The doctrine of amortization applies to an easement that provides for the continued use of an area of land that is being used for a purpose that violates a restrictive covenant. The woman\u2019s facts do not indicate that any easements or covenants are at issue. C is incorrect. The doctrine of change of circumstances applies when there has been a substantial and unforeseen change in circumstances that warrants relief from a restrictive covenant. The woman\u2019s facts do not indicate that any restrictive covenants are at issue."

Her will did not specify the duties of the husband and the niece with regard to maintenance and expenses related to the farm. The husband took sole possession of the farm, did not farm the land, and did not rent the land to a third person, although the fair rental value was substantial. For two years in a row after the woman died, the county assessor sent the tax bills to the niece, but the niece did not pay the bills, because she and the husband could not agree on who should pay them. Finally, the niece paid the taxes to avoid a tax foreclosure sale. The niece then sued the husband for reimbursement for the two years\u2019 worth of property taxes. There is no applicable statute. Is the niece likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because remaindermen are solely responsible for the payment of property taxes.\nB. No, because the county assessor sent the bills to the niece.\nC. No, because the woman\u2019s will was silent on responsibility for payment of property taxes.\nD.

While the woman's will was silent as to who was responsible for payment of property taxes, it is clear that the husband was the only person with a possessory interest in the land and that he was not using the land for agricultural purposes. Therefore, the husband was solely responsible for the payment of the property taxes. The niece was justified in suing the husband for reimbursement for the two years\u2019 worth of property taxes. A is incorrect. While a remainderman is responsible for the payment of property taxes, the facts indicate that the woman's will created a life estate for the husband with the remainder to the niece. Therefore, the husband and the niece both share responsibility for the payment of property taxes. B is incorrect. The mere fact that the county assessor sent the bills to the niece does not mean that the niece was responsible for paying the bills. C is incorrect.

Several years later, she executed a mortgage on the lot to a bank to secure repayment of a $100,000 loan. Subsequently, the woman executed a mortgage on the same four-acre lot to a finance company to secure repayment of a $50,000 loan. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. The woman recently defaulted on both loans. The bank promptly initiated foreclosure proceedings and sent proper notice to all necessary parties. The current fair market value of the four-acre lot is $250,000. The finance company has filed a timely motion in the foreclosure proceeding asking the court to require the bank to first foreclose on two of the four acres in the four-acre lot. The bank opposes this motion and insists that it has the right to subject the entire four-acre lot to the foreclosure sale. Will the court grant the finance company\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the bank holds a purchase-money mortgage.\nB.

Pursuant to the exceptions clause of Article III, the U.S. Supreme Court may exercise appellate jurisdiction over a state court decision when that decision rests on state law grounds that are (1) independent of federal law and (2) adequate to sustain the result in the case. Here, the state court\u2019s ruling that the law violated the state constitution is (1) independent of federal law since the state and federal constitutions concern different subjects and (2) adequate to sustain the result in the case because a ruling that a state law violates the state constitution is necessarily a ruling that the law cannot be applied in this case. Therefore, even if the U.S. Supreme Court were to reverse the state court\u2019s ruling on federal constitutional grounds, the result in the case would be unaffected. B is incorrect. The U.S. Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over state court decisions that find federal laws unconstitutional, but not over decisions that find state laws unconstitutional. C is incorrect.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA city ordinance prohibited individuals from picketing in residential neighborhoods unless the picketing related to the neighborhood zoning requirements.

Will the group\u2019s challenge likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the ordinance is a content-neutral regulation of speech.\nB. No, because the ordinance regulates conduct rather than speech.\nC. Yes, because the ordinance irrationally discriminates between different types of protesters.\nD.

The law promotes a compelling state interest that outweighs any burden on interstate commercial activity that might\nresult from this state regulation of its groundwater.\nB.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The day after signing the contract, the engineer was injured while bicycling and was rendered physically incapable of performing as the on-site supervisor. The engineer offered to serve as an off-site consultant for the same pay as originally agreed to by the parties. Is the owner likely to prevail in an action against the engineer for damages resulting from his failure to perform under the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the engineer offered a reasonable substitute by offering to serve as an off-site consultant.\nB. No, because the engineer\u2019s physical ability to perform as on-site supervisor was a basic assumption of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the engineer breached the contract by disappointing the owner\u2019s expectations.\nD. Yes, because the engineer\u2019s duty to perform was personal and absolute.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "B is correct. When the engineer entered into the contract, he cured a basic assumption of the contract by becoming physically incapable of performing his duties under the contract. A basic assumption is an assumption that one party to the contract makes about the other party's physical or mental ability to perform under the contract. When a party's physical or mental ability to perform is a basic assumption of the contract, that party's incapacity excuses him or her from performing under the contract. Although the engineer offered to serve as an off-site consultant, this would not cure the basic assumption that the engineer would personally provide on-site services. A is incorrect. While the engineer's offer to serve as an off-site consultant may mitigate damages, it would not cure the breach since the incapacity was a basic assumption of the contract. C is incorrect. While the engineer may be liable for damages resulting from his failure to perform under the contract, he would only be liable for the difference between the value of his performance under the contract and the value of his off-site consulting services. D is incorrect. While the engineer's duty to perform may have been personal, it was not absolute. An absolute duty is one that requires a party to perform regardless of circumstances, whereas a personal duty is one that requires performance only by the party to whom it is addressed."

The bookstore business, which was housed in a building that the aunt leased, was independently appraised at $200,000. The aunt decided to retire. She wrote to the niece, expressing her affection for the niece and offering to sell her the bookstore business for $125,000 if the landlord would agree to a transfer of the lease. The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt\u2019s offer. In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms.

Because he was eager for work, the actor agreed, in the contract, to pay the agent 15% of his yearly earnings. At the end of the year, the actor was so pleased with his many roles that he gave the agent 20% of his earnings.

It is a trade practice in the acting profession for actors to pay their agents 10% of their yearly earnings, payable at the end of the year. What percentage of the actor\u2019s earnings is a court most likely to award the agent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 20%, because course of dealing is given greater weight than trade usage.\nB. 15%, because it was an express term of the contract.\nC. 10%, because trade usage is the applicable default rule.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The parties' new contract adopted the terms of their previous contract, which was a one-year contract with an option to renew. Although the previous contract did not specify a term, courts construe options to renew as options to continue a contract for an indefinite period of time. Therefore, the contract was an option contract with an indefinite term. Although the parties could have determined the terms of their new contract by referring to trade usage, they did not do so. Instead, they relied on the express term in their previous contract, which was an option term. Therefore, the express term is controlling, and the actor-agent contract is an option contract with an indefinite term. Because the option term is indefinite, the court will give the express term the broadest possible interpretation. Therefore, the court will find that the 20% fee is the express term and is controlling. A is incorrect. Although the parol evidence rule generally bars the introduction of evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations that contradict the terms of a final written contract, a party may introduce evidence of a prior agreement that is inconsistent with a written contract if the prior agreement is given greater weight than the writing. Although the prior contract between the actor and his agent is the best evidence of the parties' understanding, it is unclear whether the prior contract is a complete integration of the parties' contract. If the prior contract is only partially integrated, the parol evidence rule will permit the introduction of evidence of the parties' prior oral understanding. Although the prior contract is a better indication of what the parties intended than trade usage would be, the express term of the contract controls. Therefore, the parol evidence rule does not support the use of trade usage in this case. C is incorrect. The trade usage rule is only a default rule. When a contract is silent as to a matter that ordinarily is subject to trade usage, the trade usage rule provides that the matter will be determined in accordance with the trade. However, when a contract specifies a rate or a price, the trade usage rule does not apply. Although the previous contract between the actor and his agent was silent as to the fee the actor would pay, the express term of the contract was 20%. Therefore, the trade usage rule does not apply, and the express term determines the fee. D is incorrect. The express term of the contract is indefinite, so the court will give it the broadest possible interpretation. Therefore, the court will find that the express term is a 20% fee."

            "explanation": "C is correct. When the buyer sent its offer, it contained no provision for arbitration. When the seller sent its acknowledgment, it repeated the buyer\u2019s terms, which included a provision for arbitration. Because the buyer\u2019s offer was silent as to arbitration, when the seller\u2019s acknowledgment repeated the buyer\u2019s terms and added a provision for arbitration, those arbitration terms became part of the contract. Although the buyer did not sign the seller\u2019s acknowledgment, under UCC \u00a7 2-206(2), the seller\u2019s acknowledgment became a contract for the sale of goods because the buyer\u2019s offer was for the sale of goods that exceeded $500 but did not exceed $10,000. Thus, C is correct. A is incorrect. Although arbitration may be a more efficient method of resolving disputes than resolving them in court, arbitration is only appropriate after the parties have agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration. Since the buyer did not agree to submit the dispute to arbitration, it was not a correct statement of fact that arbitration was a method that the parties could use to resolve their dispute. B is incorrect. Although it is true that the provision for arbitration did not contradict any term in the buyer\u2019s offer, the UCC does not permit the addition of terms to a contract for the sale of goods that materially alter the contract. In this case, the addition of an arbitration term to the contract qualifies as a material alteration of the contract. D is incorrect. Although a counteroffer is an offer that seeks to alter the terms of a contract, a counteroffer does not have to be signed to be effective. When the seller acknowledged the buyer\u2019s offer by repeating the terms and adding an arbitration term, those arbitration terms became part of the contract, even though neither the buyer nor the seller signed the acknowledgment."

            "explanation": "Because the buyer\u2019s offer was silent as to arbitration, the arbitration provision in the seller\u2019s acknowledgment should be characterized as an additional term. Under UCC \u00a7 2-207(2), an additional term is considered a proposal for addition to the contract. Section 2-207(2) also provides that an additional term becomes a term of the parties\u2019 contract unless certain specified circumstances are present. One such circumstance is where an additional term materially alters the parties\u2019 contract. Because none of the other circumstances appear applicable here, the arbitration provision will be considered a term of the contract if the seller can successfully argue that the provision did not materially alter the parties\u2019 contract.",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA computer retail outlet contracted to service a bank\u2019s computer equipment for one year at a fixed monthly fee under a contract that was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. Three months later, the retail outlet sold the service portion of its business to an experienced and well-financed computer service company. The only provision in the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company relating to the outlet\u2019s contract with the bank stated that the outlet \u201chereby assigns all of its computer service contracts to [the computer service company].\u201d The computer service company performed the monthly maintenance required under the service contract. Its performance was defective, however, and caused damage to the bank\u2019s operations. Whom can the bank sue for damages arising from the computer service company\u2019s defective performance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The retail outlet only, because the computer service company made no promises to the bank.\nB. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because the bank has not released the outlet and the bank is\nan intended beneficiary of the outlet\u2019s agreement with the computer service company.\nC. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because since each has the right to enforce the bank\u2019s\nperformance of its contract with the retail outlet, mutuality of remedy renders either potentially liable for the defective\nperformance.\nD. The computer service company only, because it is a qualified and a financially responsible supplier of computer\nservices.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "B is correct. Although the retail outlet effectively delegated its duty owed to the bank to the computer service company, the outlet did not provide assurance that it would be available to perform its remaining obligations under the contract. Therefore, the outlet cannot delegate its duty owed to the bank without the bank\u2019s consent. Since the bank has not released the outlet, and since the bank is an intended beneficiary of the outlet\u2019s agreement with the computer service company, the bank has the right to bring an action against the computer service company for damages arising from the computer service company\u2019s defective performance. A is incorrect. The computer service company made no promises to the bank, but since the bank is an intended beneficiary of the outlet\u2019s agreement with the computer service company, the bank has the right to bring an action against the computer service company for damages arising from the computer service company\u2019s defective performance. C is incorrect. Since the bank is an intended beneficiary of the outlet\u2019s agreement with the computer service company, the bank has the right to bring an action against the computer service company for damages arising from the computer service company\u2019s defective performance. Therefore, mutuality of remedy does not render either the retail outlet or the computer service company potentially liable for the defective performance. D is incorrect. The qualifications and financial responsibility of a supplier of computer services are relevant considerations in a breach of contract action, but they are not determinative."

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant is being tried for the murder of a woman who disappeared 10 years ago and has not been heard from since. Her body has never been found. The prosecutor has presented strong circumstantial evidence that she was murdered by the defendant. To help establish the fact of her death, the prosecutor has requested that the judge give the following instruction, based on a recognized presumption in the jurisdiction: \u201cA person missing and not heard from in the last seven years shall be presumed to be deceased.\u201d Is the instruction proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the fact that someone has not been heard from in seven years does not necessarily lead to a conclusion\nthat the person is dead.\nB. No, because mandatory presumptions are not allowed against a criminal defendant on an element of the charged\ncrime.\nC. Yes, because it expresses a rational conclusion that the jury should be required to accept.\nD. Yes, because the defendant has a chance to rebut the presumption by offering evidence that the woman is alive or has\nbeen heard from in the last seven years.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The U.S. Supreme Court has held it to be a violation of due process for a judge to give a mandatory jury instruction in a criminal case on an element of the charged crime. The instruction is unconstitutional because the phrase \"shall be presumed\" could be interpreted by the jury as shifting the burden of proof to the defendant or as requiring the jury to find an element of the charged crime, neither of which is permissible. A is incorrect. The fact that someone has not been heard from in seven years may lead to a conclusion that the person is dead. The instruction is not a mandatory presumption, but it is still unconstitutional. B is incorrect.

The evidence is relevant because it tends to show the defendant's propensity toward dishonesty, which is a relevant factor in determining whether he took money as charged in the case. Although the evidence is being offered by the defendant rather than a third party, the evidence is not barred by the rule against character evidence from a party-opponent's crime or conduct. The rule against character evidence bars evidence of a person's character trait from being used to show action in conformity therewith. But the rule does not bar evidence of a person's character trait when the trait is pertinent to the charge the defendant is facing. The evidence that the defendant was trusted with large sums of money without incident is relevant because it tends to show that the defendant is likely to have taken money without incident in this case.

His counsel moved to suppress any trial testimony by the store owner identifying the defendant as the robber. Should the court grant the motion and suppress the store owner\u2019s trial testimony identifying the defendant as the robber?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because suppression of in-court testimony is not a proper remedy, even though the out-of-court identification was\nimproper.\nB. No, because the out-of-court identification was not improper.\nC.

At common law, a defendant could be convicted of murder not only for an intentional killing but also for causing another\u2019s death by actions intended to cause serious bodily injury short of death. Under the facts, a jury could properly convict the man of murder under that common law theory. While a jury could certainly convict the man of lesser manslaughter or assault offenses, murder is the most serious crime of which the man could properly be convicted. B is incorrect. A jury could not properly convict the man of voluntary manslaughter. At common law, voluntary manslaughter is a killing in the heat of passion provoked by adequate provocation, or a killing in the heat of passion caused by an immediate, actual, and reasonable fear of imminent death or great bodily harm to himself from unlawful force. The friend breaking the man\u2019s television and being hit on the head with a hammer do not constitute adequate provocation or an immediate, actual, and reasonable fear of imminent death or great bodily harm sufficient for a voluntary manslaughter conviction. C is incorrect. A jury could not properly convict the man of involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of a human being in the heat of passion provoked by adequate provocation or the killing of another as the result of gross negligence or reckless indifference to consequence. Neither the friend breaking the man\u2019s television nor being hit on the head with a hammer is adequate provocation for a voluntary manslaughter conviction, and there are no facts to support a finding of gross negligence or reckless indifference to consequence sufficient for an involuntary manslaughter conviction. D is incorrect. A jury could not properly convict the man of assault. Assault is the attempt to commit criminal battery. A jury could not properly convict the man of assault because he did not attempt to commit criminal battery; he did, in fact, commit it."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

All other murder is second-degree murder, and manslaughter is defined as at common law. An employee was angry with her boss for denying her a raise. Intending to cause her boss discomfort, the employee secretly dropped into his coffee three over-the-counter laxative pills. The boss drank the coffee containing the pills. Although the pills would not have been dangerous to an ordinary person, because the boss was already taking other medication, he suffered a seizure and died. If the employee is charged with murder in the first degree, should she be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, only because she used poison.\nB. Yes, only because she acted with premeditation.\nC. Yes, both because she used poison and because she acted with premeditation.\nD. No.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

An agent decided to enter the man\u2019s house while he was not at home and see what he could find. The agent discovered an envelope containing $5,000 in cash and an executive\u2019s business card. Returning the envelope to its place, the agent located and interviewed the executive, who admitted that he had paid the man $5,000 to settle a gambling debt; the executive also disclosed that the man regularly took illegal bets from the executive and several of his acquaintances. The agent then interviewed the acquaintances, who confirmed what the executive had told him. The agent then arranged to be introduced to the man at a local bar. After a few drinks, the man, unaware of the agent\u2019s identity, boasted that he was one of the biggest bookmakers in the state. The agent testified to all of his investigation\u2019s discoveries before a grand jury, which returned an indictment against the man for illegal gambling activities, based solely on the agent\u2019s testimony. The man\u2019s attorney then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it rested on violations of the man\u2019s constitutional rights. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because dismissal of the indictment is not the appropriate remedy.\nB.

The defendant did not testify, but his sister did. She testified that on March 5, at the time of the robbery, the defendant was with her in a city 300 miles away. On cross-examination, the sister admitted having given a statement to the police in which she had said that the defendant was not with her on March 5, but she claimed that the earlier statement was mistaken.

As to the defendant\u2019s claim of alibi, which of the following additional instructions would be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Alibi is a matter of defense and so must be established by the defendant; however, the burden of persuasion is by a\npreponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.\nB.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nWhile on their way home from a ball game, a driver and his passenger stopped at an all-night gas station. The passenger offered to pay for the gas. While the passenger pumped gas, he was surprised to see the driver enter the station, take money from the unattended cash drawer, and get back in the car. The passenger paid the attendant for the gas, and the driver drove off. The driver offered to reimburse the passenger for the gas, but the passenger declined. After discovering the missing cash, the gas station attendant called the police, and the driver was later stopped. The driver escaped with the stolen money, however, and was never prosecuted. If the passenger is prosecuted for theft as an accomplice, should he be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because he had no intent to promote the commission of the offense.\nB. No, because the driver, the principal, was never prosecuted.\nC. Yes, because he facilitated commission of the offense by failing to make any effort to stop it.\nD. Yes, because he paid the attendant while he knew the driver was holding the stolen money.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Upon arriving at the house, the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious. An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine. After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana. The young woman has filed a motion to suppress the use of both as evidence on the ground that the entry into the house and the searches were made without a warrant. How should the court decide the young woman\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Grant it as to the cocaine, but deny it as to the marijuana.\nB. Deny it as to the cocaine, but grant it as to the marijuana.\nC. Grant it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nD. Deny it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "B is correct. The police entry of the house and the searches were done without a warrant and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. However, the exclusionary rule (the evidence seized in the illegal search would have to be thrown out) does not apply in this case because the young woman consented to the entry and the searches. A is incorrect. The young woman did not consent to the police entry of her home or to the searches, so the evidence should be suppressed as to the cocaine. However, because the young woman did consent to the police entry of her home and the searches, the evidence should not be suppressed as to the marijuana. C is incorrect. The police entry of the house and the searches were done without a warrant and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the evidence should be suppressed as to both the cocaine and the marijuana. However, because the young woman consented to the entry and the searches, the evidence should not be suppressed as to the marijuana. D is incorrect. The police entry of the house and the searches were done without a warrant and thus violated the Fourth Amendment.
