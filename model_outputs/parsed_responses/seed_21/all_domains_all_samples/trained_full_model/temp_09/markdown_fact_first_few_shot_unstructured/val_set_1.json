The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn January, a teacher contracted with a summer camp to serve as its head counselor at a salary of $10,000 for 10 weeks of service from the first of June to the middle of August. In March, the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed. In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for that job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period as the summer camp. In a breach-of-contract action against the camp, to which of the following amounts, as damages, is the teacher entitled?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $4,000.\nB. $4,200.\nC. $10,000.\nD. $10,200.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier wrote the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed its latest audited financial statements to the supplier, as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the lumber supplier for breach of contract. Will the manufacturer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contract was unenforceable, since the manufacturer had not committed to purchase a definite quantity\nof lumber.\nB. No, because the supplier had reasonable grounds for insecurity and was therefore entitled to cancel the contract and\nrefuse to make any future deliveries.\nC.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Unconscionability is a defense that can be raised to enforce a contract. A contract is unconscionable if it is unreasonably favorable to one party and is not within the fair dealing of natural justice. Under UCC \u00a7 2-312(2), a merchant is under a duty to disclose to a buyer all facts known to the merchant about a goods that a reasonable person in the circumstances could consider to be pertinent to the buyer's decision to enter into the contract, and such disclosure shall be made in writing. The facts known to the dealer about the accident were pertinent to the buyer's decision to enter into the contract and should have been disclosed in writing. Although the dealer's misleading statement is not the sole reason for the contract's unconscionability, it was a material factor, and the dealer should be held liable for his nondisclosure. A is incorrect because the buyer would not have a duty to inspect under UCC \u00a7 2-512(2), which provides that a buyer has no duty to inspect goods that are in the usual course of trade sold in the form in which they are bought. C is incorrect because the contract is not unconscionable simply because it is unfavorable to one party. The contract would be unconscionable if it contained a provision that shocked the conscience under the circumstances, but such a provision was not present in this fact pattern."

The accident history of the car would be material to the decision of a buyer. The seller's statement, taken in context, and in light of the seller's active steps to conceal evidence of the damage and repair, would be the legal equivalent of a statement that the car had not been in an accident.

UCC \u00a7 2-706(1) gives a seller the right to resell goods after a buyer has repudiated a contract and provides that the seller is entitled to recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price plus the lost profit. However, UCC \u00a7 2-706(2) provides that if the resale is made at a public sale, the seller is entitled to recover only the difference between the resale price and the contract price. In this case, the seller's damages should be limited to $2 per set under A or B since the seller resold the goods to the salvage company for $2 per set less than it cost to manufacture the goods.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

One week after the chef was hired by the bakery, a hotel offered the chef a position as a restaurant manager at a salary of $2,500 a month. The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery. Is the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a contract for permanent employment would be interpreted to mean the chef could leave at any time.\nB. No, because the position the chef took with the hotel was not substantially comparable to the one she had agreed to\ntake with the bakery.\nC. Yes, because the chef's acceptance of a permanent position meant that she agreed to leave the bakery only after a\nreasonable time.\nD. Yes, because the chef's failure to give the bakery a chance to match the salary offered by the hotel breached the\nimplied right of first refusal.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

This is a contract for employment and as such is subject to the rule that a contract for permanent employment means that the employee agrees to work for the employer until death or until a reasonable time after the employee is offered a better job. Since the chef agreed to work for the bakery on a permanent basis, the rule applies, and the bakery should lose its lawsuit against the chef. B is incorrect. Whether the position the chef takes with the hotel is comparable to the one she agreed to take with the bakery is irrelevant. What matters is whether the position is permanent or temporary. If it is permanent, the rule described in A applies. If it is temporary, then the position will be compared to the bakery position to determine if there is a breach. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the rule in A applies, but it misstates the reason for the application of that rule. A contract for permanent employment means that the employee agrees to work for the employer until death or until a reasonable time after the employee is offered a better job."

The bank agreed to that arrangement and the car dealer then directed the buyer to make the payments to the bank. When the buyer tendered the first payment to the bank, the bank refused the payment, asserting that it would accept payment only from the car dealer. On June 2, the bank demanded that the car dealer pay the debt in full immediately. The car dealer refused to pay and the bank sued the car dealer to recover the $10,000.

Each invoice was silent in regard to any discount from the price for prompt payment. The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery. In all of their prior transactions and without objection from the seller, the buyer took 15 days to pay and deducted 5% from the invoice price. The same delivery procedure and invoice were used in the present contract as had been used previously. The present contract called for a single delivery of wheat at a price of $300,000. The seller delivered the wheat and the buyer then signed the invoice.

Although the mother or the son reasonably could have employed, for $6,000, an equally qualified instructor to replace the tutor, neither did so. The son failed the bar exam and the law firm refused to employ him. It can be shown that had the son received the instruction, he would have passed the bar exam. If the mother and the son join as parties plaintiff and sue the tutor for breach of contract, how much, if anything, are they entitled to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $1,000, because all other damages could have been avoided by employing another equally qualified instructor.\nB. $55,000, because damages of that amount were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they contracted.\nC. Nominal damages only, because the mother was not injured by the breach and the tutor made no promise to the son.\nD.

When the parties contracted, they could have foreseen that if the tutor failed to perform, the mother and her son would suffer damages equivalent to the value of the promised bar exam preparation instruction. Therefore, the victim of the breach, the mother, is entitled to recover only nominal damages. A is incorrect because even though damages could have been avoided by employing another equally qualified instructor, the mother and her son suffered only economic harm, which can be avoided by taking reasonable steps to mitigate damages. Such damages are still recoverable. B is incorrect because at the time of contracting, the parties could not have foreseen that the tutor would breach the contract. As stated above, economic damages can be avoided by taking reasonable steps to mitigate damages. When the victim of the breach takes reasonable steps to avoid economic damages, there is no basis for recovery above and beyond nominal damages. D is incorrect because taking reasonable steps to mitigate damages does not constitute a novation or an excuse for the breach."

No, because substantial performance is a constructive condition to the landowner's duty to pay at the contract rate.\nB.

Yes, because the contract is divisible, and the landowner will be required to bring a separate claim for the builder's\nfailure to complete the other two structures.\nD.

A contract that is divisible allows the parties to perform their obligations in stages or in separate units, with payment for each unit being due only after completion of that unit. However, where one party's performance requires the expenditure of money or the use of tools or materials that cannot be divorced from the entire contract, that party must complete its performance before the other party is obligated to pay. In other words, a divisible contract may require the parties to complete all of their contractual obligations before any payment can be due. Here, the contract was divisible because it required the builder to construct three separate structures. However, the facts state that the builder's performance required the use of tools and materials that cannot be separated from the entire contract.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA carpenter contracted with a homeowner to remodel the homeowner's home for $10,000, to be paid on completion of the work. On May 29, relying on his expectation that he would finish the work and have the homeowner's payment on June 1, the carpenter contracted to buy a car for \"$10,000 in cash, if payment is made on June 1; if payment is made thereafter, the price is $12,000.\" The carpenter completed the work according to specifications on June 1 and demanded payment from the homeowner on that date. The homeowner, without any excuse, refused to pay. Thereupon, the carpenter became very excited, suffered a minor heart attack, and, as a result, incurred medical expenses of $1,000. The reasonable value of the carpenter's services in remodeling the homeowner's home was $13,000. In an action by the carpenter against the homeowner, which of the following should be the carpenter's measure of recovery?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $10,000, the contract price.\nB. $11,000, the contract price plus $1,000 for the medical expenses incurred because the homeowner refused to pay.\nC. $12,000, the contract price plus $2,000, the bargain that was lost because the carpenter could not pay cash for the car\non June 1.\nD. $13,000, the amount the homeowner was enriched by the carpenter's services.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

When a contract is partially enforceable on an anticipated consideration basis, the party who is entitled to enforce it may recover on breach the reasonable value of his expected consideration, plus any actual damages sustained by the breach. The carpenter was entitled to recover $10,000, the contract price. When the carpenter refused to accept payment on June 1, the homeowner was not excused from paying the contract price and, therefore, is liable for the reasonable value of the carpenter's services in remodeling his home. The reasonable value of those services was $13,000. Thus, A and C are incorrect. D is incorrect because the amount the homeowner was enriched is irrelevant to the carpenter's damages. When a party has a right to recover on a contract that has been partially performed, he may recover the reasonable value of his expected consideration, plus any actual damages sustained by the breach. In this case, the expected consideration was the $10,000 contract price."

It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside Green, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in Green. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in Green. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in Green. The Green legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of Green from faulty science and to protect Green toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in Green of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in Green satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the Green law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it abrogates the obligations of the contracts between the other toy manufacturers and their Green outlets\nwho have agreed to sell their Martian toys.\nB. No, because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because it deals only with a local matter, the sale of toys in Green stores.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The law imposes a ban on a category of toys, rather than singling out particular toys for a ban. Therefore, it triggers the supremacy clause, which requires that such laws be applied only to out-of-state toy manufacturers and not to those who manufacture toys in Green. The ban is also an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. Because the Martian toys are manufactured only in Green, the burden of having to conform to the Martian toy standard will fall only on out-of-state manufacturers. There is not a rational relationship between the burden on interstate commerce and a legitimate state interest. The state could argue that its interest in protecting its children from faulty science justifies the burden on interstate commerce, but regulating the content of toys is a more burdensome way to achieve that goal than could be justified by a compelling state interest. A is incorrect because the contracts clause does not apply to this situation. Contracts between out-of-state merchants over the sale of goods in another state need not apply the federal contracts clause, because such contracts are subject only to the law of the state where the goods are sold. C is incorrect because the Martian toy ban is not a local measure. It applies to all toys sold in Green stores, which is not local enough to satisfy the local-affecting clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."

Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate against the out-of-state toy manufacturers, it has a purely discriminatory effect against them, and the state has less discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate interests cited in the law. The state law therefore violates the negative implications of the commerce clause.",

A is incorrect because the rule relating directly to law enforcement does not mean that it does not need specific congressional authorization. The rule is a legislative rule because it has general applicability and it governs the manner in which Forest Service land may be used.

Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was \"to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats\" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser sued the county, claiming that the regulation has taken the purchaser's property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the county did not take title to the property from the purchaser.\nB. No, because the regulation has not caused or authorized any uninvited physical invasion or intrusion onto the property.\nC.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

Because the meeting rooms are a limited public forum, the law students had a First Amendment right to use a room for a meeting discussing affirmative action, and the law school administration could not refuse that use because of the content of the speech. The law school administration's denial of the meeting room is not the least restrictive means with which to protect a compelling state interest because there are less restrictive means for the law school to achieve its goal of protecting against friction among the students that might disrupt the institution's educational mission. For example, the law school administration could have allowed the meeting to occur in a less central location on campus or could have allowed it to occur in another building on campus. A is incorrect because the law school administration need only demonstrate that its action was rationally related to a legitimate state interest, not that it is necessary to vindicate a compelling state interest.

The statute also provided that public proceedings must precede adoption of the standards, and that once they were adopted, the standards would be subject to judicial review. No standards have yet been adopted. Several officials of the National Bureau of Standards have indicated their personal preference for beer produced by a special brewing process commonly referred to as pasteurization. However, these officials have not indicated whether they intend to include a requirement for pasteurization in the minimum beer quality standards to be adopted by the Bureau. A brewery that produces an unpasteurized beer believes that its brewing process is as safe as pasteurization. The brewery is concerned that, after the appropriate proceedings, the Bureau may adopt quality standards that will prohibit the sale of any unpasteurized beer.

The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state. When it adopted the law, the state legislature declared that its purpose was to reduce the risks of infection of local citrus crops by itinerant diseases that have been found to attack citrus fruit. A national association of citrus growers sued to have the state law declared unconstitutional. The association claims that the law is prohibited by the negative implications of the commerce clause of the Constitution.

The man may have been engaging in trespass, but that does not make his communication unprotected by the speech clause of the First Amendment. B is incorrect. Trespass does not make a communication unprotected by the speech clause of the First Amendment. D is incorrect.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice.\nB. No, because murder is a specific intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that they intended to kill.\nC. Yes, because the gang members made no effort to save the informant after he had been stabbed.\nD. Yes, because voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A is correct. Mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient evidence to prove that a person is an accomplice to that crime. To be an accomplice, the person must have the intent to aid the principal's criminal enterprise and aid in the commission of the crime. Because mere presence is insufficient evidence to prove intent to aid a criminal enterprise, the appellate court should overturn the convictions. B is incorrect. Murder is a specific intent crime, but the evidence in this fact pattern shows that the gang members had the intent to kill the informant. C is incorrect. Lack of effort to save a victim after a murder does not prove intent to kill. If the gang members did not intend to kill the informant, their lack of effort to save him after he was stabbed does not prove that they did have the intent to kill him. D is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication does negate criminal responsibility in some cases, but not in this case. If the gang members were so intoxicated that they did not know that the informant was dead, this would negate their criminal responsibility for his murder. But in this fact pattern, the gang members watched the informant slowly bleed to death, and there is no indication that their intoxication prevented them from understanding what was happening. Thus, voluntary intoxication is not a defense to the murder convictions in this case."

Illegality of the arrest is not a valid defense to a prosecution for attempt. D is incorrect. Merely having the intent to commit a crime is insufficient for a conviction for attempt. There must also be a substantial step toward commission of the crime. Thus, A is correct. C is incorrect. The subjective standard (what was in the defendant's mind) is used in attempt cases.

A defendant was tried for murder. Over his objection, he was tried by a jury composed of 6 jurors.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the license number of the driver's car. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her and the car, and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat of the car.

She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny it as to all photographs.\nB.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The woman committed two separate crimes: obtaining property by false pretenses and robbery. The woman obtained the clerk's property--money from the register--by means of a false pretence--that there was a threat to the clerk's safety. The woman also committed robbery, which is the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. The threat to the clerk's safety was sufficient to constitute the necessary forceful taking. The woman's lie about the man with a rifle was necessary to her scheme; it was the basis for the clerk's belief that he should hand over the money. Therefore, the woman also committed larceny by trick. Although larceny by trick is a specific intent crime, in this case the woman's false statement was so central to the scheme that it cannot be separated from the overall intent to deprive the owner of the property. A is incorrect. The woman may not be guilty of embezzlement, which is the fraudulent conversion of another person's property by someone who had lawful possession of it. The woman had no lawful possession of the money; she obtained it through robbery. C is incorrect. The woman can be convicted of larceny by trick and obtaining property by false pretenses, but she cannot be convicted of both larceny and robbery. The woman committed robbery, which is the taking of property by force or threat of force. Larceny is the taking and carrying away of the property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. In this case, the woman's threat of force was sufficient to constitute the taking, which occurred when the woman put the money into a bag. The woman's larceny and robbery are separate offenses, and she can be convicted of both. D is incorrect. The woman can be convicted of both larceny by trick and obtaining property by false pretenses but not of both larceny and robbery."

The defendant, without the owner's consent, took and carried away the owner's property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, and attenuation of the original crime does not serve to reduce the larceny to a lesser offense. Although the defendant only walked out of the store with the property and did not carry it far, this is sufficient to be convicted of larceny. The other crimes listed are less serious and are larceny related offenses. A is incorrect. The most serious crime that the defendant committed is larceny. Although robbery shares some common elements with larceny (taking and carrying away of the property), robbery requires that the taking occur by force or threat of force. There was no force or threat of force used in this fact pattern. C is incorrect. The most serious crime that the defendant committed is larceny. Although false pretenses shares some common elements with larceny (obtaining possession and title by fraud or misrepresentation), false pretenses requires that the property be conveyed with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, whereas larceny only requires the intent to take and carry away the property. In this fact pattern, the defendant obtained possession and title of the property, by fraud, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, and attenuation of the original crime does not serve to reduce the larceny to a lesser offense. D is incorrect. The most serious crime that the defendant committed is larceny. Embezzlement shares some common elements with larceny (the taking of another person's property), but embezzlement requires that the property must have been lawfully obtained.

During the conversation, the employee admitted committing the robbery. The employee was charged in state court with the robbery. He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions.

In such a jurisdiction, a non-aggressor may use deadly force only after making a proper retreat. No retreat is necessary if it cannot be made in complete safety. Additionally, there is no obligation to retreat while in an occupied structure. B is incorrect because the structure in which the defendant and the husband were standing was an occupied structure; thus, the defendant was permitted to stay even if he could have retreated.

The lease provided for $700 monthly rental. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term, until he moved to a new job in another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his \"lease rights\" for the remaining nine months of the lease. The friend made the next four monthly $700 rental payments to the landlord. For the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left of the lease term. The landlord was on an extended trip abroad, and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until last week. The landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally, for $3,500 for the last five months' rent. What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

When the friend made the payments to the landlord, he did not become a party to the lease contract, but merely substituted for the tenant under the privity of estate. As such, the friend is liable for the last five months' rent at the rate the tenant agreed to pay. The tenant, who was still obligated under the lease contract despite having moved out, is liable for the portion of the rent that was not paid by the friend. Both parties are liable for the full $3,500, but the friend is liable for a greater portion. A is incorrect because neither the tenant nor the friend has relied on the other's conduct to create a partnership or joint venture. C is incorrect because the absence of a landlord objection does not excuse the tenant from paying rent or make the friend liable for payment.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landowner executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey his land to a friend. The landowner handed the instrument to the friend, saying, \"This is yours, but please do not record it until after I am dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives.\" Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed. The friend said that he would destroy the deed and a day or so later falsely told the landowner that the deed had been destroyed. Six months ago, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestate, survived by a daughter as his sole heir at law. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him. As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land. For whom should the court hold?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter, because the death of the landowner deprived the subsequent recordation of any effect.\nB. The daughter, because the friend was dishonest in reporting that he had destroyed the deed.\nC. The friend, because the deed was delivered to him.\nD.

There was no one alive who could claim the landowner's interest. The only interests in the land remaining were those of the daughter's friend and the cousin.

Subsequently, the church wanted to relocate and entered into a valid written contract to sell the land to a buyer for a substantial price. The buyer wanted to use the land as a site for business activities and objected to the church's title. The contract contained no provision relating to the quality of title the church was bound to convey. There is no applicable statute. When the buyer refused to close, the church sued the buyer for specific performance and properly joined the grantor as a party. Is the church likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the grantor's interest prevents the church's title from being marketable.\nB. No, because the quoted provision is a valid restrictive covenant.\nC.

The landowner's wife had a determinable life estate (measured by her life or until remarriage) in the land, and a vested remainder in fee simple (measured by the daughter's life or until the daughter remarried, whichever came first). Both of the wife's interests were subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP). The Rule dictates that where any person has a life estate subject to a subsequent grant, and a vested remainder, and where the person's interest is also subject to the RAP, the grant will be void. Because the daughter's interest terminated on her death and the wife's interest terminated on her remarriage, neither could be a person with a life estate subject to a subsequent grant. Therefore, the grant to the daughter and the wife terminated the wife's life estate and created a new, determinable life estate for the daughter. The subsequent grant to the wife's new husband terminated the wife's life estate for the daughter's life and created a vested remainder in fee simple. Because the wife's new husband's interest is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities, his grant terminated the daughter's life estate and he now owns the fee simple. A is incorrect because the daughter's grant terminated on her death, and the wife's grant terminated on her remarriage. Both of the wife's interests terminated before the daughter's interest terminated. As such, neither of the wife's grants could have terminated the daughter's interest. B and D are incorrect because neither the wife nor her new husband owns the fee simple. Both must await the termination of the daughter's interest before either can acquire title by reason of surviving the daughter."

They expressly agreed that the neighbor would not assume and agree to pay the investor's debt to the partner. The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating in pertinent part \" . . . , subject to a mortgage to [the partner],\" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage. The neighbor took possession of the land and made several mortgage payments, which the partner accepted. Now, however, neither the neighbor nor the investor has made the last three mortgage payments.

For the past nine years, the rancher has impounded on her land the water that resulted from rain and melting snow, much of which flowed from the farmer's land. The rancher uses the water in her livestock operation. Recently, the farmer increased the size of his farming operation and built a dam on his land near the boundary between the two tracts. Because of the dam, these waters no longer drain from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. There is no applicable statute. The rancher sued the farmer to restrain him from interfering with the natural flow of the water onto her land. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The farmer, because he has the right to use all of the water impounded on his land.\nB. The farmer, because the rancher's past impoundment of water estops her from asserting the illegality of the farmer's\ndam.\nC.

The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance. How should the $200,000 surplus arising from the bid on the parking garage be distributed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It should be paid to the bank.\nB. It should be paid to the businessman.\nC.

Therefore, the net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage ($200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance) should be paid to the bank, leaving the businessman ($200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance) liable for the deficiency. A is incorrect. The bank's priority over the financing company's means that the bank should receive the net proceeds from the parking garage ($200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance), not the net proceeds from the hotel ($200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance). B is incorrect. Although the businessman is liable for the deficiency, he cannot receive the net proceeds from the parking garage sale ($200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance).

The recorded subdivision plan imposed no restrictions on any of the 10 lots. Within two months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to a buyer, by a deed that contained no restriction on the lot's use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner, on behalf of himself as the owner of the unsold lot, and on behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on Lot 1. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The doctor, because Lot 1 was conveyed without the inclusion of the restrictive covenant in the deed to the first buyer\nand the subsequent deed to the doctor.\nB. The doctor, because zoning ordinances override private restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.\nC. The landowner, because the doctor, as a successor in interest to the first buyer, is estopped to deny that Lot 1 remains\nsubject to the zoning ordinance as it existed when Lot 1 was first conveyed by the landowner to the first buyer.\nD. The landowner, because with the first buyer's knowledge of the facts, Lot 1 became incorporated into a common\nscheme.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The fact that other lots were sold with the restriction and that the doctor had actual knowledge of this fact are irrelevant to the outcome of the case.

As soon as the parties signed the contract, the seller (who had already moved out) canceled her insurance covering the land. The buyer did not know this and did not obtain insurance. A few days later, three weeks before the agreed closing date, the building on the land was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. There is no applicable statute. In an appropriate action, the buyer asserted the right to cancel the contract and to recover his earnest money. The seller said the risk of fire loss passed to the buyer before the fire, so the buyer must perform. If the seller prevails, what is the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Once the parties signed the contract, only the buyer had an insurable interest and so could have protected against this\nloss.\nB. The buyer's constructive possession arising from the contract gave him the affirmative duty of protecting against loss\nby fire.\nC. The seller's cancellation of her casualty insurance practically construed the contract to transfer the risk of loss to the\nbuyer.\nD. Upon execution of the contract, the buyer became the equitable owner of the land under the doctrine of equitable\nconversion.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The plaintiff alleged that the store negligently allowed its entryway to become slippery due to snow tracked in from the sidewalk. When the plaintiff threatened to sue, the store's manager said, \"I know that there was slush on that marble entry, but I think your four-inch-high heels were the real cause of your fall. So let's agree that we'll pay your medical bills, and you release us from any claims you might have.\" The plaintiff refused the offer. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to testify to the manager's statement that \"there was slush on that marble entry.\" Is the statement about the slush on the floor admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is a statement made in the course of compromise negotiations.\nB. No, because the manager denied that the slippery condition was the cause of the plaintiff's fall.\nC. Yes, as an admission by an agent about a matter within the scope of his authority.\nD. Yes, because the rule excluding offers of compromise does not protect statements of fact made during compromise\nnegotiations.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Federal Rule of Evidence 408 excludes \"[e]vidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations.\" Here, there was a dispute, and the manager's statement was made in an effort to settle that dispute. Therefore, the entire statement is inadmissible under Rule 408. While normally an admission of fact accompanying an offer to pay medical bills would be admissible, here, the offer to pay medical bills itself was an offer to compromise, and the entire statement is inadmissible under Rule 408. B is incorrect because the manager did not deny that the slippery condition caused the plaintiff's fall; instead, he impliedly denied that the store caused the slippery condition. Moreover, even if the manager had denied that the slippery condition caused the plaintiff's fall, his statement would still be inadmissible under Rule 408. C is incorrect because the rule excluding offers of compromise does not protect statements of fact made during compromise negotiations. In any event, the manager's statement is inadmissible under Rule 408, so even if it were a statement of fact, it would be inadmissible.

However, it is inadmissible on the issue of whether the defendant should be held liable for slander, because in that case the plaintiff's actual character is an essential element of the defense, and proof must be made by specific instances of conduct. A is incorrect. The testimony of a witness who is not a party to the case is not hearsay. C is incorrect. The testimony of a witness who is not a party to the case is not hearsay. D is incorrect. The testimony of a witness who is not a party to the case is not hearsay."

            "explanation": "In slander cases, where the defendant makes a statement that the plaintiff has an unsavory character, the plaintiff's character is considered \"in issue\" (i.e., an essential element of the claim or defense under the substantive law) in two respects: First, the plaintiff's actual character will determine whether the defendant was incorrect in his assessment, and thus liable for slander, because truth is a defense. Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched; but if the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character and to the extent of damages. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 405, when character is \"in issue\" it can be proved by evidence of reputation, opinion, or specific acts.",

In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it.

But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The construction company's motion for summary judgment should be denied, because the delivery company's cross-motion for summary judgment presents an issue for summary judgment--whether the construction company is liable for the full value of the stolen goods. When the construction company stipulated that it was negligent and admitted liability for the damage to the truck, it waived any defenses based on contributory negligence or proximate cause. The delivery company's motion for summary judgment should be granted, because the construction company's waiver of defenses means that the only issue left to decide is whether the construction company is liable for the full value of the stolen goods. The delivery company's motion for summary judgment should be denied, because it is based on the wrong legal standard. A court grants summary judgment for the moving party if the moving party shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Here, the law is clear that, when an injured party's only theory of recovery is that a defendant is liable for the full value of the loss, as here, summary judgment for the defendant will be denied. When the moving party shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the court should deny the opposing motion for summary judgment. B and D are incorrect because they misstate the applicable standard."

However, in cases in which negligence is an issue, a verdict for the party with undisputed evidence may be improper if the other side's proof also consists of undisputed evidence and establishes a prima facie case of negligence. In such cases, the jury should be instructed to return a verdict for the party with the prima facie case of negligence. Here, the decedent's estate's evidence that the decedent had a heart attack and was driving normally prior to the event establishes a prima facie case of negligence.

A is incorrect. While it is true that, in such cases, the jury should be instructed to return a verdict for the party with the prima facie case of negligence, the rule does not apply when one side's proof consists solely of undisputed evidence. In such cases, the court will instruct the jury to return a verdict for the party with undisputed evidence. C is incorrect.

It is possible for a party to be liable for the entire bottling process, even if he or she had no control over some of the acts that occurred during that process. C is incorrect. This is a strict liability claim. For strict liability to apply, the plaintiff must prevail without having to prove negligence. It is possible for a party to be liable for the entire bottling process, even if he or she had no control over some of the acts that occurred during that process. D is incorrect. This answer misstates the applicable standard for defective products."

The child, by his representative, sued the driver of the car, the playmate's parents, and his own parents. At trial, the child's total injuries were determined to be $100,000. The playmate's parents were determined to be 20% at fault because they had failed to adequately supervise her. The driver was found to be 50% at fault. The child's own parents were determined to be 30% at fault for failure to adequately supervise him. The court has adopted the pure comparative negligence doctrine, with joint and several liability, in place of the common-law rules relating to plaintiff's fault. In addition, the common-law doctrines relating to intra-family liability have been abrogated.
