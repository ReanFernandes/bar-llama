The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn a suit based on a will, inheritance of $1 million depended upon whether the wife had survived her husband when both died in the crash of a small airplane. An applicable statute provided that, for purposes of distributing an estate after a common disaster, there was a rebuttable presumption that neither spouse had survived the other. A witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane she heard what she thought was a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d although by the time the two occupants were removed from the wreckage they were both dead. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.\nB. No, because the witness\u2019s testimony is too speculative to support a finding.\nC. Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.\nD. Yes, because it is relevant and not otherwise prohibited.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

No, because the bank teller was at fault in allowing loss of the original by failing to secure the check.\nD. No, because it is not possible for either the jury or an expert to compare the signature on the missing check with a\nsignature established as genuine.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nUnited States customs officials received an anonymous tip that heroin would be found inside a distinctively marked red package mailed from a foreign country to the United States. Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun. The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to suppress its use as evidence. Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.\nB. Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.\nC. No, because, having found the package, the agents had probable cause to believe more narcotics could be located in\nthe house and the gun was found in a proper search for narcotics.\nD. No, because narcotics dealers are often armed and the search was justified to protect the agents.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The customs search of the package was not within the scope of the warrant, because the warrant authorized a search of the house for the package, not for its contents. The customs officers' resealing of the package did not make their subsequent search within the house legal."

Police saw a man wearing a white hooded sweatshirt and blue sweatpants pacing nervously outside one of the city\u2019s banks just before it closed. The police stopped the man and frisked the outer layers of his clothing for weapons, but found none. They asked the man what he was doing outside the bank and pointed out that he was wearing clothing similar to clothing worn by the perpetrator of recent robberies. After pausing for several moments, the man confessed. The police had not provided him with any Miranda warnings. After being charged with the bank robberies, the man moved to suppress his confession. The parties agreed, and the court properly found, that the police had reasonable suspicion but not probable cause at all times before the man confessed. Should the man\u2019s motion to suppress be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the confession was the fruit of a Fourth Amendment violation, even though there was no Miranda\nviolation.\nB. Yes, because the confession was the fruit of a Miranda violation, even though there was no Fourth Amendment\nviolation.\nC.

The stranger was unlawfully restrained by the driver--the driver was ordered to keep driving by the stranger, who was a passenger in the driver's car, and the stranger ordered the driver to pull over in a remote location. That, combined with the stranger's consistent and subsequent actions of robbing the driver and ordering the driver out of the car, all are clear indications that the stranger was the victim of a kidnapping.

The man went to the friend\u2019s barn, opened the door, found a black saddle, and took it back to the woman\u2019s house. The friend had in fact not borrowed a saddle from the woman, and when the friend discovered her black saddle missing, she suspected that the woman was the thief.

            "explanation": "Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, which is a state of mind characterized by extreme ill will. The fact that the neighbor was unconscious is clear evidence that the neighbor was not acting with malice aforethought, and thus that the hit man\u2019s shooting the neighbor was not murder. Attempted murder requires an intention to kill. The hit man\u2019s shooting the neighbor was an attempt to kill him, but the neighbor was already dead when the hit man shot him. The hit man was acting with the intent to kill the neighbor, but the neighbor was not the victim of the hit man\u2019s actions. The hit man was acting with the intent to kill the neighbor, but the neighbor was not the victim of the hit man\u2019s actions. Conspiracy requires that two or more persons agree to engage jointly in conduct that the law forbids. The woman did not conspire with the hit man to murder the neighbor; she only agreed to pay him $10,000 if he murdered the neighbor. Solicitation requires that a person ask, encourage, or incite another person to engage in conduct that the law forbids. The woman did not solicit the hit man to murder the neighbor; she only agreed to pay him $10,000 if he murdered the neighbor."

The officers observed what appeared to be marijuana plants being cultivated under grow lights in the kitchen. Using this information, the officers obtained a search warrant. The execution of that warrant netted numerous marijuana plants. The woman was charged with possession of marijuana. She moved to suppress the marijuana plants recovered when the warrant was executed, claiming that the evidence supporting the warrant was obtained through a search that violated the Fourth Amendment. Should the marijuana plants be suppressed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because regardless of the lawfulness of the police conduct beforehand, they did obtain a warrant to search the\nwoman\u2019s home.\nB.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA city owned and operated a municipal bus system. The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization\u2019s request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization\u2019s placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator\u2019s decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the administrator\u2019s denial of space to the organization was a reasonable time, manner, and place\nrestriction of speech.\nB. No, because a public official may not allow the use of public facilities for the propagation of a message that he or she\nbelieves may create a false or misleading impression.\nC. Yes, because a public official may not refuse to permit the dissemination of a message in a public forum wholly on the\nbasis of its content unless that denial is necessary to serve a compelling government interest.\nD. Yes, because a public official may not refuse to allow the use of any public facility to publish a message dealing with\nan issue of public concern.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "This question asks about the administrator's decision to refuse the group's placard. Because the administrator's decision is a refusal to allow the group to use the city's buses to post its message, it is a content-based restriction on speech, which is presumed unconstitutional. The only exceptions are content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions and those that are necessary to serve a compelling state interest. The administrator's denial of the group's placard is neither of these; it is a content-based restriction, and thus presumed unconstitutional."

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn response to the need for additional toxic waste landfills in a state, the state\u2019s legislature enacted a law authorizing a state agency to establish five new state-owned and state-operated toxic waste landfills. The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community\u2019s residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens\u2019 group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill. The agency officials moved to dismiss. Which of the following is the most appropriate basis for the court to dismiss this suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nB. The interest of the state in obtaining suitable sites for toxic waste landfills is sufficiently compelling to justify the\nselection of the community as a location for such a facility.\nC. The Eleventh Amendment bars suits of this kind in the federal courts.\nD. The case is not ripe for a decision on the merits.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The Supreme Court has identified a number of factors that may lead a court to determine that a case presents a political question. One of these is when a case requires the court to determine \"the meaning of a constitutional provision,\" because that is \"a task that has been entrusted to the political branches of our government.\" This case requires the court to determine the constitutionality of the state law, which would require the court to determine the meaning of the state constitution."

Although the landowner had posted signs that said, \u201cNo Hunting\u2014No Trespassing,\u201d hunters frequently intruded to kill the deer. Recently, the landowner built an eight-foot chain-link fence, topped by three strands of barbed wire, across a gully on her land that provided the only access to the area frequented by the deer. A wildlife photographer asked the landowner for permission to enter the property to photograph the deer. Because the landowner feared that any publicity would encourage further intrusions, she denied the photographer\u2019s request. Frustrated, the photographer attempted to climb the fence. He became entangled in the barbed wire and suffered extensive lacerations. The wounds became infected and ultimately caused his death. The photographer\u2019s personal representative brought an action against the landowner. Will the plaintiff prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the landowner may not use deadly force to protect her land from intrusion.\nB. Yes, because the landowner had no property interest in the deer that entitled her to use force to protect them.\nC.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nThe owner of a shopping mall hired a construction company to design and construct the entryway to the mall.

The customer's slip and fall are clear indications that the mall's entryway was not reasonably safe. The injured customer will therefore be successful in recovering damages from the mall owner. The injured customer will be successful in recovering damages from the mall owner, because the mall owner is liable for the negligent actions of its employees or of an independent contractor if the mall owner is in control of the activities that led to the injury. The construction company was an independent contractor and was therefore responsible for its own negligent actions, and thus the mall owner will be held liable for the construction company's negligent design of the mall's entryway."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA company manufactured metal stamping presses that were usually sold with an installed safety device that made it impossible for a press to close on a worker\u2019s hands. The company strongly recommended that its presses be purchased with the safety device installed, but would sell a press without the safety device at a slightly reduced price. Rejecting the company\u2019s advice, a worker\u2019s employer purchased a stamping press without the safety device. The press closed on the worker\u2019s hand, crushing it. In an action brought by the worker against the company, will the worker prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the company\u2019s press was the cause in fact of the worker\u2019s injury.\nB. Yes, because the company sold the press to the worker\u2019s employer without an installed safety device.\nC. No, because the failure of the worker\u2019s employer to purchase the press with a safety device was a superseding\nintervening cause of the worker\u2019s injury.\nD.

A buyer gave the seller a signed handwritten offer to purchase the house. The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller\u2019s home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance. The buyer declared the contract voided by the fire, but the seller asserted a right to enforce the contract despite the loss. There is no applicable statute. If a court finds for the seller, what is the likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The contract was construed against the buyer, who drafted it.\nB.

The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her.

The second bank's mortgage is a junior mortgage to the $100,000 debt to the first bank, so the due-on-sale clause in that mortgage would not prevent the farmer from obtaining a loan secured by a mortgage on the farm to repay the $5,000 debt to the second bank. However, the farmer did obtain a loan secured by a mortgage on the farm to repay the $5,000 debt to the second bank. That mortgage is thus a mortgage that was created with the farmer's knowledge that the farmer's mortgage to the first bank contained a due-on-sale clause. The second bank has not presented any evidence that the farmer was not in compliance with the terms of the mortgage securing the $5,000 debt, so the farmer is entitled to have the mortgage held by the second bank found invalid on that basis. The farmer's repurchase of the farm was not in collusion with the buyer at the foreclosure sale, as the buyer was not a party to the farmer's mortgage to the first bank or the mortgage securing the $5,000 debt to the second bank."

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA seller who owned land in fee simple entered into a valid written agreement to sell the land to a buyer by installment purchase. The contract stipulated that the seller would deliver to the buyer, upon the payment of the last installment due, \u201ca warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\u201d The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The buyer entered into possession of the land. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the buyer discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on the land, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25 percent of the purchase price that the buyer had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the seller had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the seller. The value of the land was then four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller\u2019s alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the buyer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nB. Yes, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a mortgage and the outstanding mortgage impairs the\nbuyer\u2019s equity of redemption.\nC. No, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a security device.\nD. No, because the time for the seller to deliver marketable title has not arrived.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The seller has made all mortgage payments timely. The amount of the mortgage debt is 25 percent of the purchase price the buyer will pay, and the land is four times more valuable than the debt owed, so it is likely that the mortgage debt will be paid off by the time the seller must provide the warranty deed, and thus the buyer is not entitled to damages at this time.",

The contract stated, \u201cThe parties agree that closing will occur on next May 1 at 10 a.m.\u201d There was no other reference to closing. The contract was silent as to quality of title. On April 27, the seller notified the buyer that she had discovered that the land was subject to a longstanding easement in favor of a corporation for a towpath for a canal, should the corporation ever want to build a canal. The buyer thought it so unlikely that a canal would be built that the closing should occur notwithstanding this outstanding easement. Therefore, the buyer notified the seller on April 28 that he would expect to close on May 1. When the seller refused to close, the buyer sued for specific performance. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the easement renders the seller\u2019s title unmarketable.\nB. No, because rights of third parties are unresolved.\nC. Yes, because the decision to terminate the contract for title not being marketable belongs only to the buyer.\nD.

A brother and sister owned the land as tenants in common, the brother owning a one-third interest and the sister owning a two-thirds interest. Neither of them owned any other real property. The sister brought an appropriate action to partition the land and proposed that a two-acre rectangular lot with 100 feet of frontage be set off to her and that a one-acre rectangular lot with 50 feet of frontage be set off to the brother. The brother\u2019s defense included a demand that the land be sold and its proceeds be divided one-third to the brother and two-thirds to the sister. Who will prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Thereafter, the city condemned approximately two-thirds of the land. The tenant notified the city and the landlord that an independent appraisal of the value of the tenant\u2019s possessory interest established that it substantially exceeded the tenant\u2019s obligation under the lease and that the tenant was entitled to share the award.

In an appropriate action among the landlord, the tenant, and the city as to the right of the tenant to a portion of the condemnation award, for whom will the court likely find?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landlord, because the condemnation superseded and canceled the lease.\nB. The landlord, because the parties specifically agreed as to the consequences of condemnation.\nC.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

Fifteen years ago, after a part of the path located on his land and connecting his cabin to the public highway washed out, the man cleared a small part of his neighbor\u2019s land and rerouted a section of the path through the neighbor\u2019s land. Twelve years ago, the neighbor leased her land to some hunters. For the next 12 years, the hunters and the man who had rerouted the path used the path for access to the highway. A month ago, the neighbor discovered that part of the path was on her land. The neighbor told the man that she had not given him permission to cross her land and that she would be closing the rerouted path after 90 days. The man\u2019s land and the neighbor\u2019s land have never been in common ownership. The period of time necessary to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The period of time necessary to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. What should the lawyer tell the man concerning his right to use the rerouted path on the neighbor\u2019s land?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The man has fee title by adverse possession of the land included in the path.\nB. The man has an easement by necessity to use the path.\nC. The man has an easement by prescription to use the path.\nD. The man has no right to use the path.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "The man has an easement by necessity to use the path. The facts are consistent with the man's use of the neighbor's land being an easement by necessity. He used the neighbor's land because it was necessary to use the neighbor's land to access the highway, and the neighbor's failure to claim the portion of the path on her land was a failure to claim the neighbor's property. The neighbor is thus not entitled to shut down the man's use of the neighbor's land. The man has an easement by necessity to use the neighbor's land because the neighbor's failure to claim the path was a failure to claim the neighbor's property."

With an easement, the owner may make any use of the easement area that does not interfere with the use made by the easement holder unless the easement is expressly noted as exclusive.

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \u201cIt is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\u201d Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor\u2019s intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor\u2019s proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owners of lots in the subdivision own property benefitted by the original residential covenant and\nhave the sole right to enforce it.\nB. No, because the man owns property benefitted by the original restrictive covenant and has a right to enforce it.\nC. Yes, because the original restrictive covenant violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nD.

The doctor owns a house in the subdivision, but the doctor's house is not benefitting from the original covenant; the five-acre tract owned by the man is benefitted by the covenant. A is also incorrect because the man is not the owner of property benefitted by the original covenant. Again, the five-acre tract owned by the man is benefitted by the covenant. The man is, however, the owner of the property whose use is restricted by the covenant--the five-acre tract. B is incorrect because the man is not the sole person with a right to enforce the covenant. The doctor, the owner of a house in the subdivision, is also a person entitled to enforce the covenant, because his use of his own property would be directly affected by a failure to enforce the covenant. C is incorrect because the original covenant does not violate the Rule Against Perpetuities. The Rule Against Perpetuities applies to restrictions on the use of land, but not to restrictions on the use of buildings on land. The original covenant is a restriction on the use of the five-acre tract, not on the use of the doctor's house. D is incorrect because the zoning ordinance does not preempt the original covenant. The zoning ordinance permits the doctor's proposed use of his house, but that permit is not enough to overcome the original covenant. The doctor cannot use his house as a medical office because the covenant prohibits uses on the five-acre tract other than residential uses."

The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000. The buyer knew nothing of the friend\u2019s mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot. Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her bank of the mortgage claimed by the investor\u2019s friend, the bank loaned her $15,000, and she gave the bank a note for $15,000 due in two years secured by a mortgage on the lot. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. At that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cNo conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\u201d Both notes are now due and both the investor and the buyer have refused to pay. The lot is now worth only $50,000. What are the rights of the investor\u2019s friend and the bank in the lot?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both mortgages are enforceable liens and the friend\u2019s has priority because it was first recorded.\nB.

The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee\u2019s will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. The grantee\u2019s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might\nhave.\nC.

In this case, the price for the purchase was to be set by three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers and was thus fair.

That section provides that \"a contract for the transportation of goods is binding on the carrier and the shipper as indicated in the contract.\" Here, the contract is clear that the seller is the shipper, so that would be who would be bound by the contract. The contract does not specify who is the carrier, but the seller is identified as the seller, which makes the seller the most likely party to be the carrier. Thus, the seller is the party bound by the contract to transport the bracelets, so the risk of loss would pass to the buyer when the bracelets were delivered to a carrier for transportation."

The client orally offered to pay the architect $7,500 in full settlement of the claim for the fee. The architect orally accepted that offer despite the fact that the reasonable value of his services was in fact $10,000. The client paid the architect $7,500 pursuant to their agreement.

The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nOn May 1, a seller and a buyer entered into a written contract, signed by both parties, for the sale of a tract of land for $100,000. Delivery of the deed and payment of the purchase price were scheduled for July 1. On June 1, the buyer received a letter from the seller repudiating the contract. On June 5, the buyer bought a second tract of land at a higher price as a substitute for the first tract. On June 10, the seller communicated a retraction of the repudiation to the buyer. The buyer did not tender the purchase price for the first tract on July 1, but subsequently sued the seller for breach of contract. Will the buyer likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the seller retracted the repudiation prior to the agreed time for performance.\nB. No, because the buyer\u2019s tender of the purchase price on July 1 was a constructive condition to the seller\u2019s duty to\ntender a conveyance.\nC. Yes, because the seller\u2019s repudiation was nonretractable after it was communicated to the buyer.\nD. Yes, because the buyer bought the second tract as a substitute for the first tract prior to the seller\u2019s retraction.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The contract expressly required that the excavator begin work on June 1 to enable other subcontractors to install utilities. On May 15, the excavator requested a 30-day delay in the start date for the excavation work because he was seriously behind schedule on another project. When the contractor refused to grant the delay, the excavator stated that he would try to begin the work for the contractor on June 1. Does the contractor have valid legal grounds to cancel the contract with the excavator and hire a replacement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the excavator committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract by causing the contractor to feel\ninsecure about the performance.\nB. Yes, because the excavator breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nC. No, because the excavator would be entitled to specific performance of the contract if he could begin by June 1.\nD. No, because the excavator did not state unequivocally that he would delay the beginning of his work.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The clerk\u2019s position would be terminated due to the dissolution, and he did not have a retirement plan. The accountant and the bookkeeper informed the clerk of their plan to fund an annuity for him. The clerk, confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity, purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100,000 to fund the annuity, but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50,000. The accountant agreed that the bookkeeper should contribute only $50,000. Does the clerk have a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the clerk was bound by the modification of the agreement made by the accountant and the bookkeeper.\nB. No, because the clerk was only a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper, and\nhad no vested rights.\nC.

            "explanation": "The clerk has a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000. The clerk is a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper. A donee is a person who receives a benefit from a transaction but is not a party to the transaction. The clerk is clearly a donee beneficiary here. But because the clerk is a donee beneficiary, he only has a right to have the promises made by the accountant and the bookkeeper honored, he does not have a vested right. A vested right is a right that will not be affected by a subsequent event or a change in circumstances. Because the clerk is a donee beneficiary, he has a right to have the promises made by the accountant and the bookkeeper honored, but he does not have a vested right to the $50,000. The clerk's reliance on the promised retirement fund prevented the parties from changing the terms of the agreement to contribute $50,000 each. The clerk's reliance on the promised retirement fund made it impossible for the accountant and the bookkeeper to change the terms of the agreement and contribute only $50,000 each. Because the clerk's reliance on the promised retirement fund prevented the parties from changing the terms of the agreement, the clerk has a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000. The promises to establish the fund were made binding by consideration from the clerk's many years of employment. Consideration is something of value that is given up in exchange for a promise. The clerk's many years of employment with the accountant and the bookkeeper were the consideration for the accountant and the bookkeeper's promises to establish the fund. The accountant and the bookkeeper's promises to establish the fund were made binding by the consideration of the clerk's many years of employment."

On March 2, the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer\u2019s order was for a rush job, the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day\u2019s delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25,000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25,000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5,000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid, which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic\u2019s best defense to the textile company\u2019s action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Time was not of the essence in the contract between the mechanic and the textile company.\nB. The mechanic had no reason to foresee on March 1 that the customer would suffer consequential damages in the\namount of $25,000.\nC. By entering into the contract with the customer while knowing that its knitting machine was being repaired, the textile\ncompany assumed the risk of any delay loss to the customer.\nD. In all probability, the liquidated damages paid by the textile company to the customer are not the same amount as the\nactual damages sustained by the customer in consequence of the late delivery of the cloth.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
