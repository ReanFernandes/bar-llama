                "Fact_analysis": "In determining whether parties are diverse, federal courts consider the citizenship of the parties, including that of the parties to the action and those who brought the action if the party is a trust or estate. The question of whether the parties are diverse is determined at the time the action is filed, and the citizenship of a party who is added at a later date is not considered. Therefore, the attorney for the shareholder would need to know where the company has sufficient minimum contacts, specifically where the company is incorporated and where it has its principal place of business, in order to determine whether the parties are diverse.",
                "Rule_application": "To establish complete diversity, there must be no governmental entity or other party who is a citizen of the same state as any party who is not a governmental entity. Therefore, the attorney would need to know where the company is incorporated and where its principal place of business is located to determine whether the shareholder and the company are citizens of different states, which is necessary for complete diversity.",

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Although a request for waiver of service was sent, the defendant was not obligated to and did not respond to the request. Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party.

Answer B is incorrect. There is no obligation to seek a new trial before challenging jury instructions on appeal, so long as the applicable plain error standard can be satisfied. Plain error is the standard because the defendant failed to object at trial. Answer C is incorrect. Plain error, not abuse of discretion, is the standard for reviewing instructions that the parties did not object to, as was the case here. Answer D is incorrect. The errors were not waived by the failure to object. Rather, the failure to object waived full review, with the result that the standard for assigning error was raised to plain error.",

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer D is incorrect. For most objections to jury instructions, the objection must be made before the instruction is given to the jury. There is no 28-day window after the jury is instructed to object to any instructions.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC. The court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law because he implicitly assumed the risk of the manager\u2019s carelessness.\nD. The court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law because no reasonable jury would find him less at fault than the manager.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect.

The complaint alleged that the fire had been caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the house\u2019s electrical system in accordance with the applicable housing code. The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent.

Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB.

The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect.

The answer involves the constitutional principle that the President may appoint and, with Senate consent, remove executive branch officials, including independent agency heads.",
                "Rule_application": "Given that Congress created the agency and the director position, but did not provide for removal without the Senate\u2019s consent, the President can remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent.

United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), and Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986). Answer A is incorrect. A series of Supreme Court cases beginning with Myers sharply limits Congress\u2019s ability to impose conditions on the removal of federal officials.   Answer B is incorrect. Myers and subsequent cases make it clear that the Senate has no role in the removal of federal officers other than via impeachment. Answer D is incorrect because it is an overbroad statement of the law. The Supreme Court has upheld the power of Congress to remove certain types of federal officials, such as those serving as members of the governing bodies of regulatory agencies and inferior officers in agencies where the head of the agency is removable by the President at will.",

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC. Order the company to give the resident an opportunity for a hearing, because the Fourteenth Amendment applies to private entities performing public functions.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right.

Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard.

There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard.

A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race.

Under UCC \u00a7 2-206, an offer made by an order of goods may be accepted by the shipment of goods or by a prompt promise to ship. Here, the shipment of the laptops constituted the manufacturer\u2019s acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer and the terms set forth in the offer. Answer A is incorrect. The manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops was a reasonable mode of acceptance and gave rise to a contract. Answer B is incorrect. The retailer\u2019s order constituted an offer, and a contract was formed when the manufacturer shipped the laptops. Therefore, the exclusion of consequential damages in the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment constituted a request to modify that contract. The exclusion would become a term of the parties\u2019 agreement if the retailer assented to it, which did not occur here.   Answer D is incorrect. This response assumes that the parties formed a contract under UCC \u00a7 2-207(3) by their conduct.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC. Yes, because since the parties were both mistaken as to the content of the writing, the court will reform the writing to express their agreement.\nD.

The firm had to hire another subcontractor to perform the electrical work, at a cost of $115,000. The firm completed the construction of the plant at a profit. Which of the following statements correctly describes the firm\u2019s legal rights, if any, against the first subcontractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The firm is entitled to recover nominal damages only, because it completed the construction at a profit.\nB. The firm is entitled to recover reliance damages, because it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid when it submitted its own bid to the municipality.\nC. The firm is entitled to recover expectation damages, because the first subcontractor\u2019s bid was irrevocable for a reasonable time and the firm timely accepted it.\nD. The firm has no rights against the first subcontractor, because the first subcontractor was free to revoke its bid at any time before the firm accepted that bid.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The municipality awarded the construction contract to the firm, but before the firm could inform the subcontractor of the award, the subcontractor withdrew his bid due to new work commitments. The firm was then forced to hire another subcontractor to complete the electrical work, at a cost of $115,000, resulting in a financial loss. ",

Specifically, the firm can recover damages based on the detrimental reliance it made on the subcontractor\u2019s bid when submitting its own bid to the municipality. The firm reasonably relied on the subcontractor\u2019s bid, as it included the electrical work in its bid and was awarded the contract based on that bid.",

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

When the land was sold, the father intended for the daughter to pay the nephew the portion of the proceeds that was owed to him. However, the daughter refused to make the payment, and the nephew was notified of the daughter's refusal. The nephew then brought a lawsuit against the daughter to enforce the father's promise. Based on this scenario, the nephew is likely to prevail because he was a third-party beneficiary of the father's promise to the daughter.",

But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect.

Thus, the landowner\u2019s reasonable belief that the trees were his does not defeat liability for either the landowner or the tree specialist. Answers B and C are both incorrect. The tree specialist\u2019s action meets the definition of conversion regardless of the fact that he was directed to take that action by the landowner. Answer D is incorrect. Because the tree specialist was hired by the landowner and cut down the trees at the direction of the landowner, the landowner (along with the tree specialist) is subject to liability for conversion.",

After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC.

On the day he arrived, just after sunset, he took his bag upstairs to a second-floor bedroom and unpacked. As he was about to head back downstairs, he realized that the stairwell had become too dark to navigate without a light. The man spent about 30 seconds feeling the walls at the top of the stairwell but could not find a light switch. In fact, the switch was located in an awkward position not reachable without descending to the second step. Although he recognized the danger of descending an unfamiliar staircase in darkness, the man started down the stairs. He lost his footing halfway down, fell, and was seriously injured. The man has sued the owner of the beach house for negligence. The jurisdiction recognizes the traditional common law defense of assumption of risk. If the action proceeds to trial, which of the following would be an appropriate (paraphrased) instruction for the court to give to the jury?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling on the darkened stairs, then you must assign a percentage of responsibility to the man.\u201d\nB. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling on the darkened stairs, then you must find for the owner.\u201d\nC. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man was a mere licensee, then you must find for the owner.\u201d\nD. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, then you may in your discretion award the man both compensatory and punitive damages.\u201d\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC. It is not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in places that are visible to neighbors.\nD. Unsightly conditions ordinarily do not of themselves amount to an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of a neighboring property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

                "Fact_analysis": "The farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and machine parts, on his own property but in a location that was clearly visible from the homeowner\u2019s back deck, where she regularly enjoyed views of the surrounding countryside. When the homeowner asked him to move the items, the farmer refused, further aggravating the dispute. The farmer\u2019s argument would be that the homeowner\u2019s use of an appraiser to determine that the market value of her property had not been diminished by the unsightly items is not relevant, as the common law rule of reasonableness in determining whether a neighbor\u2019s actions have caused an unreasonable interference.",
                "Rule_application": "In determining whether a neighbor has been unreasonable in using his or her property, the common law rule of reasonableness requires that the neighbor\u2019s use be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person under similar circumstances. In this scenario, a reasonable person in the farmer\u2019s position would not be expected to keep unsightly items on his own property, particularly when those items are clearly visible to a neighbor who regularly uses her back deck to enjoy the surrounding countryside. Therefore, the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability would be that the homeowner failed to meet the common law rule of reasonableness, supporting option D.",

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from.

Answer D is incorrect. While the statements in the letter are those of a party-opponent, the woman\u2019s testimony is inadmissible under the best evidence rule.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph \u201cis what the proponent claims it is.\u201d The witness\u2019s proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw it. Proof that cell-phone technology produces accurate photographs is unnecessary, given the witness\u2019s testimony. Answer D is incorrect.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection.

His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue. Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 701, property owners are entitled to express opinions on the value of their property, but here the stockholder is expressing an opinion on the cause of the publicly traded stock\u2019s price drop. Such testimony requires a witness with specialized knowledge about the stock market.",

In rebuttal, the prosecutor calls an eyewitness to testify that she observed the argument from a short distance away and that she heard a gunshot before the victim lunged at the defendant. Thereafter, the defendant seeks to call the bartender from the nightclub to testify that the eyewitness had consumed a large amount of alcohol before the shooting and that the music in the nightclub at the time of the shooting was extremely loud. The prosecutor objects that the bartender\u2019s testimony would be improper impeachment. How should the judge rule on the prosecutor\u2019s objection?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Allow the bartender\u2019s testimony about both the eyewitness\u2019s alcohol consumption and the music.\nB. Allow the bartender\u2019s testimony about the music but not about the eyewitness\u2019s alcohol consumption, because alcohol consumption is an improper basis for impeachment.\nC.

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

The burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house), and the benefit was on her retained lot (to preserve her view of the lake). The equitable servitude was in writing and was recorded, providing constructive notice of it; actual notice was not required. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house) and the benefit was on the mother\u2019s retained lot, the benefit does not limit the mother to building only a one-story house. The mother was permitted to build a three-story house on her lot without being estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser of the son\u2019s lot. Answer B is incorrect. The son did receive his lot by a deed of gift, and no consideration was given. The mother created an equitable servitude, which may be by deed of gift, when she conveyed the third lot to her son, and that deed was recorded, giving constructive notice of the servitude. Answer D is incorrect. It is irrelevant whether the mother is in privity of contract with the purchaser. The son had privity of contract with his mother, who created an equitable servitude when she conveyed the third lot to her son.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The nephew and the niece inherited the vacant land as tenants in common. While neither is personally liable on the mortgage, their failure to pay could result in a foreclosure. To avoid foreclosure, payment must be made to the bank, and as co-tenants, each is responsible for his or her share of the mortgage payment. The nephew paid more than his pro rata share and thus may recover the amount owed by the niece in a contribution action. Answer A is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration applies when land that is subject to a mortgage is acquired at the time of death and an attempt is made by the specific legatee to claim that the mortgage must be paid from general estate assets, a scenario that does not exist here. Answer C is incorrect. A partition action is not required before bringing an action for contribution for making mortgage payments that, if not made, might have resulted in the foreclosure on the property by the bank. Answer D is incorrect. Each tenant in common is required to make his or her pro rata share of payments such as mortgage payments, which if not paid could result in foreclosure on the property.

The assignment made no express reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records.

Unbeknownst to the supplier and the dealer, the lookout had been wounded by the bullets but was not dead; he died as a result of the fall from the cliff. Can the supplier be convicted of murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the shooting and the disposal of the body were separate events that cannot be viewed as a single scheme or plan.\nB. No, because the supplier did not intend that the fall from the cliff would kill the lookout.\nC. Yes, because both the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of the original plan to kill the lookout.\nD.

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement. Under the applicable statute, the degree of the crime (and, hence, the severity of the authorized punishment) depends upon the value of the property embezzled.

The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
