The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA homeowner was using a six-foot stepladder to clean the furnace in his home. The homeowner broke his arm when he slipped and fell from the ladder. The furnace had no warnings or instructions on how it was to be cleaned. In a suit by the homeowner against the manufacturer of the furnace to recover for his injury, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the danger of falling from a ladder is obvious.\nB. No, because the homeowner should have hired a professional to clean the furnace.\nC. Yes, because the furnace did not have a ladder attached to it for cleaning purposes.\nD. Yes, because the lack of warnings or instructions for how to clean the furnace made the furnace defective.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A ladder is considered to be a \"household item,\" and thus, the owner is presumed to know how to safely use it. The homeowner was using a six-foot stepladder, which is a relatively short ladder. The homeowner's failure to use a longer ladder or to take other appropriate safety measures led to his injury. The homeowner's injury was proximately caused by the homeowner's failure to use a ladder with appropriate safety measures. The homeowner is therefore not entitled to recovery from the furnace manufacturer."

The injured driver's damages are $100,000, and the neighbor is 30% at fault for entrusting his car to the teenager, so the neighbor's recovery from the injured driver will be reduced by $30,000. The injured driver's damages are $100,000, and the injured driver is 10% at fault, so the injured driver's recovery from the teenager will be reduced by $10,000. The injured driver's damages are $100,000, and the teenager is 60% at fault, so the injured driver's recovery from the teenager will be reduced by $60,000. The injured driver's total recovery is $100,000 - $30,000 - $10,000 - $60,000 = $90,000."

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

After the mother\u2019s death and with the daughter\u2019s permission, the son took sole possession of the farm and agreed to pay the daughter a stipulated monthly rent. Several years later, the son defaulted on a personal loan, and his creditor obtained a judgment against him for $30,000. The creditor promptly and properly filed the judgment. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cAny judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\u201d Six months later, the son died. There are no other applicable statutes. Is the creditor entitled to enforce its judgment lien against the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter became sole owner of the farm free and clear of the creditor\u2019s judgment lien when the son\ndied.\nB. No, because the son\u2019s interest was severed from the daughter\u2019s interest upon the filing of the lien.\nC. Yes, because a joint tenancy cannot be created by devise, and the son died owning a 50% undivided interest in the\nfarm as a tenant in common.\nD.

The lender promptly recorded the mortgage. A year later, the landowner conveyed the same tract to a developer by a deed that expressly stated that the conveyance was subject to the mortgage to the lender and that the grantee expressly assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage obligation as part of the consideration for the purchase. The mortgage was properly described in the deed, and the deed was properly executed by the landowner; however, because there was no provision or place in the deed for the developer to sign, he did not do so. The developer promptly recorded the deed. The developer made the monthly mortgage payments of principal and interest for six payments but then stopped payments and defaulted on the mortgage obligation. The lender properly instituted foreclosure procedures in accordance with the governing law. After the foreclosure sale, there was a $10,000 deficiency due to the lender.

At the appropriate stage of the foreclosure action, which party will the court decide is responsible for payment of the deficiency?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The contract was for the sale of a parcel of land with certain specific dimensions, and the parties were unable to agree on those dimensions. This failure to agree was a breach of the parties' obligation to act in good faith, which is a necessary element of a valid contract. The buyer is therefore entitled to specific performance of the contract, because there is a clear and unambiguous agreement between the parties and the seller's failure to perform is a breach of that agreement.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA woman died, devising land that she owned in another state to her daughter, who was then 17 years old. A neighbor who owned the property immediately adjacent to the land wrongfully began to possess the land at that time. For 24 of the next 25 years, the neighbor planted and harvested crops on the land, hunted on it, and parked cars on it. However, in the sixth year after he first took possession of the land, the neighbor neither planted crops nor hunted nor parked cars on the land because he spent that entire year living in Europe. The neighbor built a small gardening shed on the land, but he never built a residence on it. When the daughter was 28, she was declared mentally incompetent and had a conservator appointed to oversee her affairs. Since then, she has continuously resided in a care facility. The applicable statute of limitations provides as follows: \u201cAn ejectment action shall be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues, but if the person entitled to bring the cause of action is under age 18 or mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues, it may be brought by such person within 10 years after attaining age 18 or after the person becomes competent.\u201d If the daughter\u2019s conservator wins an ejectment action against the neighbor, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter was age 17 when the neighbor first took possession of the land.\nB. Because the daughter is mentally incompetent, the statute of limitations has been tolled.\nC. The neighbor never built a residence on the land.\nD. The neighbor was not in continuous possession of the land for 21 years.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The neighbor was not in continuous possession for 23 years, because he was in possession for that entire year. The daughter was 17 when the neighbor first took possession of the land, which was 24 years before the daughter was declared mentally incompetent. The daughter was under 18 when the neighbor first took possession of the land, which triggers the 10-year statute of limitations for bringing an ejectment action by a person under 18. The daughter was declared mentally incompetent 21 years after the neighbor first took possession of the land, which is within the 21-year statute of limitations for bringing an ejectment action.

The buyer purchased a title insurance policy running to both the buyer and the bank, showing no liens on the property other than the buyer\u2019s mortgage to the bank. Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances. As a result of a title examiner\u2019s negligence, this mortgage was not disclosed in the title insurance policy issued to the buyer and the bank. Following this discovery, the donee successfully sued the buyer to recover the amount of the outstanding mortgage. If the buyer sues the title insurance company to recover the amount he paid to the donee, is he likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the buyer conveyed the land to an investor.\nB. No, because the title insurance policy lapsed when the buyer paid off the bank\u2019s mortgage.\nC.

The testator had had two children, a son and a daughter, but only the daughter survived the testator.

Under the applicable intestate succession laws, the deceased grandchild\u2019s sole heir was his mother. A statute of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \u201cIf a devisee, including a devisee of a class gift, who is a grandparent or a lineal descendant of a grandparent of the testator is dead at the time of execution of the will or fails to survive the testator, the issue of such deceased devisee shall take the deceased\u2019s share under the will, unless the will expressly provides that this statute shall not apply.

            "explanation": "The testator's grandchildren in fee simple are the beneficiaries of the testator's devise of his house to his grandchildren in fee simple. Because the testator's daughter is the only grandchild who survived the testator, she is the only grandchild who is entitled to inherit the house. The testator's daughter is the mother of the testator's two surviving grandchildren. The testator's daughter is thus the mother of the two grandchildren who are entitled to inherit the house. The deceased grandchild's mother is not entitled to inherit the house because she is not a grandchild of the testator. The deceased grandchild's mother is, however, entitled to inherit the testator's residuary estate, because the testator's brother is the beneficiary of that part of the testator's estate. The relevant statute provides that if a devisee who is a grandparent or a lineal descendant of a grandparent of the testator is dead at the time of the will's execution or fails to survive the testator, the issue of that deceased devisee will take the deceased's share under the will. Because the deceased grandchild was a grandchild of the testator, the deceased grandchild was a devisee who was a grandparent of the testator. The deceased grandchild was also dead at the time of the will's execution and did not survive the testator. Thus, the deceased grandchild's issue--that is, the deceased grandchild's mother--is entitled to inherit the deceased grandchild's share of the testator's estate.

The contract contained no contingencies. The seller was killed in a car accident before the parcel was conveyed, but the closing eventually took place with the conveyance by a deed from the personal representative of the seller\u2019s estate. The personal representative of the seller\u2019s estate wants to distribute the proceeds of the real property sale. The seller\u2019s will was executed many years ago and was duly admitted to probate. Paragraph 5 of his will leaves all of the seller\u2019s real property to his son, and Paragraph 6 leaves the residue of the estate to the seller\u2019s daughter. No other provisions of the will are pertinent to the question regarding to whom the proceeds of the sale should be distributed. What will determine who receives the proceeds?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Whether Paragraph 5 refers specifically to the parcel of real property that was sold or simply to \u201call of my real\nproperty.\u201d\nB.

The university is accredited by the department of education of the state in which it is located. This accreditation certifies that the university meets prescribed educational standards. Because it is accredited, the university qualifies for state funding for certain of its operating expenses. Under this funding program, 25 percent of the university\u2019s total operating budget comes from state funds. A professor at the university was a part-time columnist for the local newspaper. In one of her published columns, the professor argued that \u201creligion has become a negative force in society.\u201d The university subsequently discharged the professor, giving as its sole reason for the dismissal her authorship and publication of this column. The professor sued the university, claiming only that her discharge violated her constitutional right to freedom of speech. The university moved to dismiss the professor\u2019s lawsuit on the ground that the U.S. Constitution does not provide the professor with a cause of action in this case. Should the court grant the university\u2019s motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the right of the university to employ only individuals who\nshare and communicate its views.\nB. Yes, because the action of the university in discharging the professor is not attributable to the state for purposes of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nC.

The bakery did all of its weekly bread baking on Tuesdays. On Monday morning of the first week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 8,000 pounds of flour to the bakery, and the bakery accepted it on the wholesaler\u2019s assurance that the remaining 2,000 pounds would be delivered later that evening, which it was. The bakery paid for both deliveries on Wednesday. On Monday of the second week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5,000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5,000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender. Was the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the bakery was legally entitled to reject any tender that did not conform perfectly to the contract.\nB. Yes, because the tender was a substantial impairment of that installment and could not be cured.\nC. No, because the tender was not a substantial impairment of the entire contract, and the wholesaler had given assurance\nof a cure.\nD. No, because by accepting the first 8,000 pounds on Monday of the first week, the bakery had waived the condition of\nperfect tender and had not reinstated it.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The bakery is legally entitled to reject any tender that does not conform perfectly to the contract. The tender of 5,000 pounds of flour is a substantial impairment of the entire 10,000-pound weekly delivery, because the tender is 3,000 pounds short of the 10,000-pound weekly requirement.

The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt\u2019s offer.

In that suit, which of the following arguments best supports the seller\u2019s position that the buyer must submit the dispute to arbitration?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Arbitration is a more efficient method of resolving disputes than resolving them in court.\nB. The provision for arbitration did not contradict any term in the buyer\u2019s offer.\nC. The provision for arbitration did not materially alter the parties\u2019 contract.\nD. The seller\u2019s acknowledgment containing a provision for arbitration constituted a counteroffer that was accepted by the\nbuyer when it accepted delivery of the cotton.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "The seller's argument that arbitration is a more efficient method of resolving disputes than resolving them in court is not relevant, because the seller has not alleged that the buyer has refused to arbitrate or that the seller has been forced to bring this lawsuit. The seller's argument that the provision for arbitration did not contradict any term in the buyer's offer is also not relevant, because the seller has not alleged that the buyer has refused to arbitrate or that the seller has been forced to bring this lawsuit. The seller's argument that the provision for arbitration did not materially alter the parties' contract is also not relevant, because the seller has not alleged that the buyer has refused to arbitrate or that the seller has been forced to bring this lawsuit. The seller's argument that the seller's acknowledgment containing a provision for arbitration constituted a counteroffer that was accepted by the buyer when it accepted delivery of the cotton is correct. The seller's acknowledgment that the cotton would be delivered within five days was a response to the buyer's offer, and that response led the buyer to accept the seller's offer by accepting delivery of the cotton. The seller's acknowledgment that the cotton would be delivered within five days was thus a counteroffer, which the buyer accepted when it accepted delivery of the cotton. Because the seller has brought this lawsuit in court, the seller must prove that the buyer has breached the contract. The seller has not alleged that the buyer has refused to arbitrate or that the seller has been forced to bring this lawsuit, so the seller cannot prevail unless it can prove that the buyer breached the contract. The seller cannot prove that the buyer breached the contract by failing to arbitrate, because the seller has not alleged that the buyer has refused to arbitrate or that the seller has been forced to bring this lawsuit."

            "explanation": "Because the buyer\u2019s offer was silent as to arbitration, the arbitration provision in the seller\u2019s acknowledgment should be characterized as an additional term. Under UCC \u00a7 2-207(2), an additional term is considered a proposal for addition to the contract. Section 2-207(2) also provides that an additional term becomes a term of the parties\u2019 contract unless certain specified circumstances are present. One such circumstance is where an additional term materially alters the parties\u2019 contract. Because none of the other circumstances appear applicable here, the arbitration provision will be considered a term of the contract if the seller can successfully argue that the provision did not materially alter the parties\u2019 contract.",

The janitorial service is liable to the patient as a matter of public policy, because it violated the city\u2019s health code.\nB.

Instead, the patient is suing the janitorial service for breach of its own contractual duty to clean the patient's room in accordance with the hygiene standards of the city's health code. The patient is therefore not relying on a violation of a duty that the janitorial service had to the patient. Rather, the patient is relying on the janitorial service's violation of a duty that it had to the hospital--to clean the hospital in accordance with the hygiene standards of the city's health code. Because the patient is not relying on the janitorial service's failure to use reasonable care to protect the patient's health, the patient is not an \"involuntary\" or \"collateral\" third-party beneficiary of the hospital's contract with the janitorial service. The patient is therefore not entitled to the protection of the \"implied in fact\" or \"promissory estoppel\" doctrines. The patient is, however, an \"express\" third-party beneficiary of the hospital's contract with the janitorial service. The janitorial service's promise to clean the hospital in accordance with the hygiene standards of the city's health code was made to the hospital, but the hospital's obligation to pay the janitorial service was created by the contract and was therefore jointly for the benefit of the hospital and all hospital patients.

The buyer immediately sued the developer to avoid the contract. The construction of the golf course will probably increase the market value of the buyer\u2019s property, and the water from the city reservoir exceeds all established standards for drinking water.

The only provision in the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company relating to the outlet\u2019s contract with the bank stated that the outlet \u201chereby assigns all of its computer service contracts to [the computer service company].\u201d The computer service company performed the monthly maintenance required under the service contract. Its performance was defective, however, and caused damage to the bank\u2019s operations. Whom can the bank sue for damages arising from the computer service company\u2019s defective performance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The retail outlet only, because the computer service company made no promises to the bank.\nB. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because the bank has not released the outlet and the bank is\nan intended beneficiary of the outlet\u2019s agreement with the computer service company.\nC. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because since each has the right to enforce the bank\u2019s\nperformance of its contract with the retail outlet, mutuality of remedy renders either potentially liable for the defective\nperformance.\nD.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant is being prosecuted for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. At trial, the government seeks to have its agent testify to a conversation that he overheard between the defendant and a co-conspirator regarding the incoming shipment of a large quantity of cocaine. That conversation was also audiotaped, though critical portions of it are inaudible. The defendant objects to the testimony of the agent on the ground that it is not the best evidence of the conversation. Is the testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the testimony of the agent is not the best evidence of the conversation.\nB. No, because the testimony of the agent reports hearsay not within any exception.\nC.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The Supreme Court has held that the relevant question is whether the jury that convicted the defendant was \"substantially\" like the jury that a panel from which the jurors were drawn would be.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant was tried for armed robbery. The state introduced evidence that a man, identified by witnesses as the defendant, entered a convenience store at 11 p.m. on March 5, threatened the clerk with a gun, and took $75 from the cash register. The defendant did not testify, but his sister did. She testified that on March 5, at the time of the robbery, the defendant was with her in a city 300 miles away. On cross-examination, the sister admitted having given a statement to the police in which she had said that the defendant was not with her on March 5, but she claimed that the earlier statement was mistaken. The court instructed the jury that in order to convict the defendant, they had to find all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. As to the defendant\u2019s claim of alibi, which of the following additional instructions would be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Alibi is a matter of defense and so must be established by the defendant; however, the burden of persuasion is by a\npreponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.\nB. Before you may consider the defendant\u2019s claim of alibi, you must decide whether he has produced sufficient evidence\nto raise the issue.\nC. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was present at the convenience store at about 11 p.m. on\nMarch 5, you must find him not guilty.\nD. If the defendant\u2019s evidence has caused you to have a reasonable doubt as to whether he was the robber, you must find\nhim not guilty.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "B is correct. The defendant has presented an alibi, which is a claim that the defendant was somewhere else and therefore cannot be the perpetrator of the crime. The court must instruct the jury that they must find the defendant not guilty if they have a reasonable doubt as to his identity as the perpetrator of the crime. The burden is on the state to prove the defendant's identity beyond a reasonable doubt, and the defendant has not met that burden by presenting his alibi. The jury must decide whether they have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the crime, and if they do, they must find him not guilty."

A third state statute provides that a person acts recklessly if the person \u201cconsciously disregards a substantial and unjustified risk that the material element exists or will result from the person\u2019s conduct.\u201d The evidence at a criminal trial showed that the defendant robbed a 66-year-old man outside a senior citizens\u2019 center. The defendant testified truthfully that the robbery had occurred on a dark night, that she had had no idea how old the victim was and had not cared how old the victim was, and that she had intended to rob whomever she encountered.

No, because the only evidence on the issue showed that the defendant did not know, nor could she reasonably have\nknown, the victim\u2019s age.\nB. No, because there was no evidence of a substantial risk that the victim was age 65 or older.\nC.

Upon arriving at the house, the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious. An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine. After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana. The young woman has filed a motion to suppress the use of both as evidence on the ground that the entry into the house and the searches were made without a warrant. How should the court decide the young woman\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Grant it as to the cocaine, but deny it as to the marijuana.\nB.

The officer's discovery of the cocaine was not related to the man's shooting, and thus the officer's discovery of the cocaine would be inadmissible if the court were to grant the motion to suppress. The marijuana was found in an upstairs bedroom, and the officer's entry into that bedroom was not prompted by any activity that led him to believe that a felony had been or was being committed.
