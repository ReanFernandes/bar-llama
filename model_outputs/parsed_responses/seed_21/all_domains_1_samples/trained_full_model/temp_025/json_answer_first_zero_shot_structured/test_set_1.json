                "Fact_analysis": "The shareholder is suing the company in federal court, which requires that the parties be diverse. The information needed to determine whether the parties are diverse is the location of the company's incorporation, the place where the company distributes its cars, and the location of the company's headquarters and major place of manufacturing.",
                "Rule_application": "Diversity is established when there is a difference in citizenship between the parties. If the company is incorporated in a state, distributes its cars in another state, has its headquarters in a third state, and manufactures in a fourth state, the parties would be diverse because there would be a difference in citizenship between the shareholder, who is a citizen of state A, and the company, which is a citizen of state D.",
                "Legal_conclusion": "Given that the company is incorporated in state D, distributes its cars in state E, has its headquarters in state F, and manufactures in state G, the shareholder's attorney needs to know the location of the company's incorporation, the distribution of its cars, the location of its headquarters, and the location of its major place of manufacturing in order to determine whether the parties are diverse and thus meet the requirement for federal jurisdiction."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal.

And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party.

The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense.

The former employee had worked at the firm\u2019s headquarters throughout her employment but is now a citizen of State B. The firm seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The court has asked the parties to submit proposed jury instructions on punitive damages and the relevant authority to support those instructions.

Assume that the US Supreme Court has held that the Constitution limits punitive damages to 10 times the amount of compensatory damages. Which of the following submissions on the instructions is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Punitive damages are limited to five times the amount of compensatory damages, because State A\u2019s choice-of-law rules select State A law.\nB. Punitive damages are limited to five times the amount of compensatory damages, because in a diversity case, the court applies the damages law of the state in which it sits.\nC.

The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent.

Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB. Federal law, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control pleading in federal court.\nC. State law, because the application of federal law would be outcome-determinative.\nD.

The rule is a valid exercise of the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power, because the manner of pleading defenses is an issue that can rationally be classified as procedure and the rule itself regulates the manner and means by which the parties\u2019 rights are enforced.

Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect.

Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), the facts here do not involve a comprehensive regulation of commerce that incidentally covers some intrastate activities. Answer A is incorrect. Congress can use its commerce power to regulate economic activity, such as manufacturing and production of articles for interstate commerce, that is not itself a commercial transaction. In addition, Gonzales v. Raich holds that Congress can incidentally regulate noncommercial activities in order to effectuate regulations of related commercial activities. Answer C is incorrect. While stoves and fuels may have previously moved in interstate commerce, they are not themselves channels or instrumentalities of commerce. Answer D is incorrect. United States v.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect. It states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not applicable in this case.

The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet.

Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

Conversion occurs when an actor intentionally interacts with an item that is the personal property of another so as to permanently deprive the other of possession.

The tree specialist\u2019s action meets the definition of conversion regardless of the fact that he was directed to take that action by the landowner. Answer D is incorrect. Because the tree specialist was hired by the landowner and cut down the trees at the direction of the landowner, the landowner (along with the tree specialist) is subject to liability for conversion.",

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

The statements in the letter are not being offered for their truth and so are not hearsay. They are rather being offered as false and defamatory statements. Answer C is incorrect. While it is correct that the statements are not hearsay because they are not being offered for their truth, the woman\u2019s testimony is inadmissible under the best evidence rule. Answer D is incorrect. While the statements in the letter are those of a party-opponent, the woman\u2019s testimony is inadmissible under the best evidence rule.

For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value.

Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103.

Proof of chain of custody\u2014what happened to the evidence after it was initially seized from the apartment\u2014is one way of authenticating evidence, but it is not necessary here, since the prosecution has called a witness who will testify that he saw each of the items in the apartment. Answer D is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof sufficient to support a finding that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be. Requiring a court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be would result in keeping relevant evidence from the jury; it is too high a standard.",

But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose.

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness.

Several years later, the son conveyed his vacant lot to a purchaser using a warranty deed that made no mention of the covenant in the previous deed from the mother. The purchaser promptly recorded her deed. When the purchaser later began constructing a three-story house similar to the mother\u2019s, the mother sued to enjoin the construction. Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, since she herself constructed a three-story house.\nB. No, because there was no consideration given for the covenants in the deeds of gift.\nC. Yes, because the burden of the covenant runs with the land even if the purchaser had no actual notice of the covenant.\nD.

The equitable servitude was in writing and was recorded, providing constructive notice of it; actual notice was not required. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house) and the benefit was on the mother\u2019s retained lot, the benefit does not limit the mother to building only a one-story house. The mother was permitted to build a three-story house on her lot without being estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser of the son\u2019s lot. Answer B is incorrect. The son did receive his lot by a deed of gift, and no consideration was given. The mother created an equitable servitude, which may be by deed of gift, when she conveyed the third lot to her son, and that deed was recorded, giving constructive notice of the servitude. Answer D is incorrect. It is irrelevant whether the mother is in privity of contract with the purchaser.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

                "Rule_application": "A mortgage and a deed of trust are similar in that they are both security instruments used to secure a loan. However, there are important differences between the two. A mortgage is a conveyance of an interest in real property, such as a house or land, as security for the repayment of a debt. A deed of trust is a similar conveyance, but it is made to a trustee, who holds the property in trust for the benefit of the lender until the debt is repaid. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can foreclose on the property and sell it to pay off the debt. In a mortgage, the borrower retains the legal title to the property, but the lender has a lien on the property, which gives the lender the right to foreclose if the borrower defaults. In a deed of trust, the borrower transfers legal title to the property to the trustee, who holds it in trust for the benefit of the lender. If the borrower defaults, the lender can use the power of sale in the deed of trust to sell the property to pay off the debt. The difference between a mortgage and a deed of trust is that in a mortgage, the borrower retains the legal title to the property, while in a deed of trust, the borrower transfers legal title to the property to the trustee, who holds it in trust for the benefit of the lender.",

They purchased a gun and ammunition to commit the murder and planned to dispose of the lookout\u2019s body by pushing it off a cliff. The supplier arranged a meeting in a remote area of a state park. After the three men arrived, the supplier fired two shots at the lookout, who fell to the ground. Both the supplier and the dealer believed that the lookout was dead. The dealer subsequently pushed the lookout\u2019s body off a nearby cliff. Unbeknownst to the supplier and the dealer, the lookout had been wounded by the bullets but was not dead; he died as a result of the fall from the cliff. Can the supplier be convicted of murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the shooting and the disposal of the body were separate events that cannot be viewed as a single scheme or plan.\nB. No, because the supplier did not intend that the fall from the cliff would kill the lookout.\nC.

The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft.

Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
