Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "U.S. Supreme Court precedent establishes that a law that burdens a fundamental vested property interest will be upheld if it is necessary to serve a compelling government interest and the law is not unrelated to the interest to be served. Here, the law burdens a fundamental vested property interest--the right to the use of oil and gas in a tract of land--by extinguishing the interests of those who die with less than a 1% interest in the tract. The law is necessary to serve the state's legitimate interest in fostering resource development, however, because the law allows the remaining owners to develop the tract in a manner that would be impossible if each owner had to include the interests of the extinguished heirs in any extraction contract. The law is also substantially related to this interest, because the law's effect of allowing the remaining owners to develop the tract as a single unit will increase the efficiency of development and maximize the ultimate recovery of oil and gas from the tract. Thus, the law is constitutional."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss.

Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving disputes between states (U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2) and cases involving disputes between the United States and a state or a foreign nation (U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2). Congress has the power to expand the Supreme Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, however, and it has done so in several instances. For example, the court has original jurisdiction over cases involving disputes between two or more states (U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2) and over cases involving disputes between citizens of different states (U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2). Because the cause of action at issue involves an official-misconduct claim brought by a private individual against a military officer, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction. If the officer were sued in his official capacity, however, the court would have original jurisdiction only if the case were brought by a state or by the officer\u2019s employer (U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2). Here, the officer is being sued in his individual capacity, so the court has original jurisdiction. B is incorrect. Article III establishes the Supreme Court as the court of last resort and provides that it has original jurisdiction over cases involving disputes between states and between the United States and a state or a foreign nation (U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2). Because the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over the case presented here, the court\u2019s original jurisdiction is not within the grant of power to Congress in Article III. C is incorrect. The Constitution vests in Congress the power to establish military tribunals (U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14). However, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving disputes between the United States and a state or a foreign nation (U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2), and the officer is being sued in his individual capacity, so the court has original jurisdiction. Because the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, Congress does not have the power to establish a military tribunal to hear this case. A is incorrect. The Constitution vests in the President as commander in chief of the armed forces the power to sanction military misconduct (U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2).

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking.

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers. However, as the Court held in Minnesota v. Murphy, neither of those entitlements transforms the exchange into a custodial interrogation.",

They connected the incidents because the vandal left specific graffiti at each site, and investigation provided the police with a reasonable suspicion that the perpetrator was a specific local resident. Using an online directory that the resident had joined, the police obtained the resident\u2019s cell- phone number. The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB. No, because the subpoena was based on a cell- phone number that the resident had voluntarily placed in the public domain.\nC. Yes, because a subpoena must be based on probable cause.\nD.

Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis. For instance, if there were no evidence of provocation, but the defense sought a manslaughter instruction, such an instruction should be denied.",

After trial, defense counsel learned that the prosecution had failed to disclose that the key witness against the defendant had previously been convicted of perjury in another case. The defense filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court rejected the defense argument and upheld the conviction because state discovery rules did not require the disclosure. The defendant then filed an appeal, arguing that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose this prior perjury conviction had violated his federal constitutional rights. Can the state appellate court overturn the conviction based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the witness\u2019s prior perjury conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery is regulated by state rather than federal procedure.\nB. No, because the prior conviction was mere impeachment rather than evidence of actual innocence.\nC.

            "explanation": "The prosecutor must disclose evidence that is known to be favorable to the defendant and that will substantially affect the outcome of the proceeding. The evidence at issue here--the perjury conviction of the key witness--was not known to be favorable to the defendant, because the perjury conviction was used to impeach the witness's testimony.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct because the prosecution has a constitutional obligation to turn over material exculpatory evidence, which includes evidence that would impeach a critical government witness. Here, the government\u2019s key witness had a conviction for an offense\u2014perjury\u2014that directly related to the witness\u2019s credibility. If the failure to disclose that information created a reasonable probability of a different outcome, then the appellate court should reverse the conviction. Answer A is incorrect because, although generally discovery is governed by state rules, the due process clause contains some core rights, such as the right to disclosure of critical exculpatory evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the scope of due process is not limited to proof of actual innocence. The government must disclose any evidence favorable to the defendant that could affect the outcome of the case. Answer D is incorrect because the due process clause requires disclosure only if the evidence is significant enough to affect the outcome. If the appellate court concludes that the outcome would not have been affected by disclosure of the witness\u2019s prior conviction, then there is no basis for reversal.",

The defendant had retained private defense counsel. As part of the prosecution\u2019s case, a federal agent testified regarding incriminating statements that the defendant\u2019s confederate, who by the time of trial was a fugitive, had made during a prior interview. Though this testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, the defense attorney raised no objection. The jury ultimately convicted the defendant. The defendant has now hired new counsel for his appeal and argues that the admission of the federal agent\u2019s testimony was erroneous. If the appeals court finds that the trial court should not have admitted the testimony, does it have the authority to reverse a conviction when the trial attorney raised no objection to the challenged testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because failure to object waives a defendant\u2019s rights.\nB. No, because the sole remedy is a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nC.

However, the defendant can still succeed on his appeal if the admission of the testimony was plain error that affected his substantial rights. Plain error exists when a misapplied legal rule creates an error that is obvious and that affects the outcome of the case. Here, the agent's testimony was erroneously admitted because it violated the Confrontation Clause. This error was obvious, because the error was obvious. Here, the error affected the defendant's substantial rights, because the agent's testimony was critical to the prosecution's case. Therefore, the appeals court can correct the error and reverse the defendant's conviction, even though the defendant did not properly preserve the issue by failing to object at trial."

Answer A is incorrect because, although a defendant\u2019s failure to object can change the standard of appellate review, it does not foreclose review. Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on direct appeal. For such errors, the defendant is not required to claim or prove ineffective assistance of counsel. Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, \u201cpenalized\u201d by an attorney\u2019s failure to object. Because the attorney did not object, the defendant must now meet the stringent requirements of the plain-error standard.

The seller was therefore the \"seller\" under UCC 2-316(1), and the woman was the \"buyer.\" Because the woman was not aware of the car's actual mileage when she sold the car to the friend, the friend cannot establish that the woman made a promise that the car had an odometer reading of 30,000 miles. Therefore, the friend cannot establish that the woman's failure to disclose the car's true mileage was fraudulent. The friend must therefore show that the car's odometer reading was a \"warranty,\" and that the car's true mileage was a \"breach\" of that warranty. The friend can show that the car's odometer reading was a warranty because it was an affirmative representation made by the seller that was intended to have the effect of creating a promise. The car's odometer reading was also a \"matter within the knowledge of the seller,\" because the seller was aware that the car's odometer had been reset to 25,000. The car's true mileage was a breach of that warranty, because the seller was aware that the car's actual mileage was approximately 90,000 and that the car's odometer reading was therefore inaccurate. The friend can therefore recover damages based on the difference between the value of the car with the true mileage and the value of the car with the inaccurate odometer reading, as long as the friend can prove the value of the car with the true mileage.

The prosecutor wishes to introduce into evidence a ledger found at the defendant\u2019s home during the execution of a search warrant. The ledger includes detailed information regarding the defendant\u2019s purchases and sales of drugs over a two-year period. The prosecutor is considering two alternative ways to lay the foundation for admission of the ledger as a business record. The first alternative is to call the police officer who executed the search warrant to testify that she found the ledger in the defendant\u2019s home. The second alternative is to call a codefendant, who has pled guilty, to testify that he was the defendant\u2019s drug supplier for over two years and that he was present when the defendant used the ledger to record their transactions as well as transactions with other buyers and sellers as they occurred. Which of the following is correct regarding the ledger\u2019s admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ledger may be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant.\nB. The ledger may be admitted through the codefendant but not through the officer.\nC. The ledger may not be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant, because business records may be introduced only through testimony by a records custodian.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation. Answer D is incorrect. The trial judge has the discretion to alter the order of proof without a showing of specific prejudice by an opposing party.",

The driver\u2019s statement to the woman is relevant to prove the driver\u2019s state of mind when he struck and killed the victim, because the victim\u2019s death was relevant to the criminal prosecution for reckless homicide. The statement is therefore within the relevant_hearsay_exception_for___ statement_made_in_civil_or_domestic_relations_proceeding_to_prove_a_fact_necessary_to_the_establishment_of_a_claim_or_defense_in_the_criminal_prosecution_that_is_the_substantive_equivalent_of_the_civil_or_domestic_relations_proceeding_. The prosecutor may therefore offer the driver\u2019s statement into evidence. The driver\u2019s statement is also not barred by the doctrine that a statement made in civil settlement negotiations between private parties is not admissible to prove the validity of a claim in a subsequent criminal prosecution. This doctrine applies only to the narrow class of cases in which a defendant is prosecuted for a crime that was committed to recover a personal debt or to enforce a contract. The victim\u2019s death was not committed to recover a personal debt or to enforce a contract, so the doctrine does not apply. Finally, the driver\u2019s statement is not excluded under the general rule that a statement made in a situation involving a lack of mutual understanding is inadmissible. The driver and the victim were not acting in a situation involving a lack of mutual understanding when the driver made his statement to the victim. The driver was not confused or mistaken as to the victim\u2019s identity, and the victim was not using a code or other cryptic language. The victim understood that the driver was telling the truth when he said that he was sorry for what had happened and that he had been too drunk to drive when he ran into the victim\u2019s husband with his car. The victim was therefore not confused or mistaken as to the meaning of the driver\u2019s statement."

When offered by the prosecution, the driver\u2019s statement to the woman is a statement of an opposing party, and therefore it would come within the exception to the hearsay rule set out in FRE 801(d)(2)(A).

Statements made in negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its enforcement authority may be admissible in a subsequent criminal case.

Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action.

The defendant objected to the extension on the ground that there had been ample time to prepare and that the delay would result in increased costs. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the attorney has not shown good cause for the delay.\nB. No, because the court has set the date for jury selection.\nC. Yes, because the additional time could facilitate a settlement.\nD. Yes, because the defendant has not shown sufficient prejudice that will result if the requested extension is granted.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Here, the movant has not shown good cause for failing to meet the original deadlines. The movant's attorney knew that the discovery and motions deadlines were set in the scheduling order and that the jury-selection and trial date had been set for two months after the motions deadline. Despite this knowledge, the movant waited until after the motions deadline had expired to move for an extension of the deadlines. The movant has not shown that the failure to meet the original deadlines was due to circumstances beyond her control. The defendant, however, has shown that it was prejudiced by the delay. The defendant has prepared for trial and is ready to proceed. The defendant has not had sufficient time to prepare to meet the movant's evidence, and the defendant will be forced to try this case without the benefit of the evidence that it would have presented had the discovery and motions deadlines been met. Thus, the movant has not shown good cause for the requested modification of the scheduling order, and the court should deny the motion."

Answer C is incorrect. Whether additional time could facilitate a settlement is immaterial, because it does not speak to whether the moving party can show the required diligence needed to establish good cause. Answer D is incorrect. The busy schedule of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not establish the good cause needed to amend the scheduling order, which is why the motion should be denied. A party opposing a requested extension would need to show prejudice that would likely result from the extension only if the moving party had first met its burden to show good cause.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a judgment on the pleadings may be made after the pleadings are closed. However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be premature.",

The man denies fault for the decedent\u2019s death. At trial, the executor\u2019s only witness testifies that shortly before the accident he was riding 50 feet behind the man and saw the man rapidly approaching the decedent until they were only a few feet apart. This witness briefly looked away, heard an unusual noise, and immediately afterward saw the decedent and the decedent\u2019s bike on the ground.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

This was not a situation where the defendant could not have discovered the grounds for JMOL until after the deadline had passed. The defendant had the opportunity to discover the grounds for JMOL before the deadline, but it waited until after the deadline to move for JMOL. Therefore, the court will not consider the motion."

If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery.

However, the owner was aware of evidence that the manufacturer had fraudulently misrepresented the car's emissions standards. If the owner had included the fuel economy issue in the pretrial order, the manufacturer would have been able to present evidence at trial that the car's emissions standards were not relevant to the car's fuel economy. Thus, the owner's omission of the fuel economy issue from the pretrial order was necessary to prevent manifest injustice, and the court should therefore grant the owner's motion to amend the order to include the issue of whether the manufacturer had also fraudulently misrepresented the car's fuel economy."

Generally, a gift inter vivos is revocable, and the woman could have revoked her devise of the land to the charity by executing a new will or by destroying the will. However, because the woman died testate and the charity is entitled to the land under the will, the charity is a \"bona fide\" purchaser of the land. As a bona fide purchaser, the charity takes the land free of any interests held by the woman before her death, including the mortgage held by the bank.

The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. Acceleration clauses are valid. While typically triggered by nonpayment of the mortgage debt, they can also be triggered by the mortgagor\u2019s failure to satisfy other conditions in the mortgage, such as timely payment of insurance premiums. Answer A is incorrect. Once acceleration has properly occurred, the consequences cannot be avoided because the owner attempts to pay the delinquent insurance premium. Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect. The desire to bring a foreclosure action does not create a right to accelerate a mortgage. Rather, the right to accelerate depends upon whether a term of a mortgage has been breached. Such a term may include, as here, the failure to pay an insurance premium.",

Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order in which they were executed.

To avoid the foreclosure, the developer executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure conveying the land back to the seller.

            "explanation": "When the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter, the son held the property as a life estate. The son therefore had no power to convey a fee simple to the purchaser. Therefore, the purchaser took the property as a life estate, and the son took the remainder. The son's interest was therefore a life estate pur autre vie, and the purchaser took a life estate. The daughter, however, held the property as a fee simple. When the daughter died, her husband took the property as the surviving spouse of the life tenant. Thus, the husband owns the fee simple and the purchaser owns a life estate."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by deed\u201d or \u201cafter-acquired property.\u201d Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple to the purchaser (the son\u2019s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired it from the son.      Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death. Answer C is incorrect. Here again, the daughter did not purport to convey a life estate to the purchaser and even if she had, it would have terminated at her death. Answer D is incorrect. Remainder interests are alienable.",

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire. Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is possible that a third party wrongfully let the cattle out of the pen.\nB. No, because the trucker must submit direct evidence of negligence in order to invoke the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.\nC.

Res ipsa loquitur is appropriate when the circumstances of an injury raise an inference that the injury was caused by negligence, and there is no other obvious explanation for the injury. Here, the trucker was injured when his truck hit cattle that had escaped from the farmer's cattle pen. The farmer has strict liability for the harm caused by his escaping cattle.

The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and the trucker did not contribute to the accident, so the jury is permitted to conclude that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. Answer A is incorrect. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and since the trucker did not contribute to the accident, the jury can infer that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect. The trucker needs to establish that the farmer was in exclusive control of the pen, that the accident would not have occurred but for negligence, and that the accident was not due to the trucker\u2019s own actions.

The rupture resulted from a defect in the tire that existed at the time it was sold by the manufacturer to a retailer, who sold it to the driver and installed it on her car. The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year. After discovering this memorandum, the driver\u2019s attorney filed a timely amended complaint, adding a claim for battery. The manufacturer has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the battery claim, based on the undisputed facts set out above. If no additional facts are provided to the court concerning the risk of tire rupture, should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care to prevent ruptures.\nB. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that consumers would be injured by tire ruptures.\nC.

            "explanation": "A is correct because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that a reasonable manufacturer would have taken greater care to prevent ruptures. A manufacturer has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid placing products with a known defective design into the stream of commerce. The manufacturer can be held strictly liable for damages resulting from a defective product that was placed into the stream of commerce, and a victim of the defective product may recover damages from the manufacturer based on strict liability or on a theory of negligence. The victim may also recover damages based on a theory of strict liability if the victim can show that the manufacturer engaged in conduct that was so reckless or outrageous that the manufacturer should be held to have intended to cause the victim's harm. To recover damages based on a battery claim, however, the victim must show that the manufacturer intentionally or recklessly placed the tire into the stream of commerce, knowing that it would cause the victim to suffer a harmful or offensive contact. Because the victim cannot establish that the manufacturer intended or knew to a substantial certainty that the tire would cause the victim to suffer a tire rupture, the victim cannot recover damages based on a battery claim.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The driver might have a valid strict products liability claim against the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support a finding\u2014required for battery liability\u2014that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect.

The distributor knew that an improper ratio of sand, water, and cement would result in defective concrete, but the distributor played no role in determining the ratio used by the construction company in mixing the concrete. The construction company used the concrete to form supporting columns for a building. A year later, the building collapsed during a minor earthquake, causing injury to the occupants.

The defective concrete was a cause in fact of the collapse. Do the injured building occupants have viable strict liability claims against the sand distributor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because component suppliers are not strictly liable in tort.\nB.

Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 5 (1998). In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer A is incorrect. The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met). Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer D is incorrect.

Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the company did not expressly authorize the security officer\u2019s specific actions does not necessarily allow it to avoid liability.

To establish battery, a plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant's contact with the plaintiff was (2) intentional or reckless and (3) the contact was (a) harmful or (b) offensive. Here, the father's conduct was sufficiently offensive to support a battery claim. The father's conduct was offensive because his conduct was so extreme that it would shock the conscience of a reasonable person. This is known as the \"shocks the conscience\" standard. To recover damages for battery, the bus driver must show that the father was negligent or that the father intended to cause the bus driver harm. Because the father's conduct was sufficient to support a claim for battery, the bus driver cannot recover damages for the father's conduct under an intentional infliction of emotional distress theory. The father's conduct was not so extreme as to be outside the range of ordinary human behavior. To recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the bus driver must show that the father intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress on the bus driver. Here, the father's conduct was not so extreme as to be outside the range of ordinary human behavior. Therefore, the bus driver cannot recover damages for the father's conduct under an intentional infliction of emotional distress theory. Finally, the father's conduct was not sufficient to support a claim for trespass to chattels. To recover damages for trespass to chattels, the bus driver must show that the father (1) intentionally interfered with a possessory interest that the bus driver had in a tangible object and (2) that the bus driver suffered resulting damages. Here, the father did not intentionally interfere with a possessory interest that the bus driver had in the bus. The father did not enter the bus or touch any of the bus's personal property. Therefore, the bus driver cannot recover damages for the father's conduct under a trespass to chattels theory."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver. Even under the \u201cextended personality\u201d doctrine\u2014which, for example, allows a battery plaintiff to establish the necessary contact element if the defendant touches an article of clothing the plaintiff is wearing\u2014making contact with the bus is almost certain not to count as contacting the driver\u2019s person. Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect. The driver is not likely to be considered to have a possessory interest in the damaged bus, and therefore trespass to chattels would not be a viable claim.",

Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle. The supervisor told the dispatcher that he should quit if he couldn\u2019t handle the increased hours. Over the next three months, the dispatcher continued to complain about the working conditions, to no effect. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury. He eventually was hospitalized and had to miss several months of work as a result of the emotional distress. The dispatcher sued the trucking company for negligence. The company has moved for summary judgment, based on the undisputed facts set out above. Assume that there is no applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute. How should the court rule on the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny the motion, because the jury must determine the extent of the emotional distress suffered by the dispatcher.\nB.

Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty.

The daughter was a layperson who was not in the chain of distribution, and the mother was the appropriate defendant. The daughter\u2019s allergy was very rare, as was the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy.

The mother, knowing of her daughter\u2019s very rare allergy, should not have purchased the medication without knowing what ingredients were in the coating, but that would not create a failure to warn by the manufacturer. B is incorrect. The manufacturer\u2019s duty is to warn the \u201cutmost contemporary user,\u201d which is generally understood to mean the end user.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",
