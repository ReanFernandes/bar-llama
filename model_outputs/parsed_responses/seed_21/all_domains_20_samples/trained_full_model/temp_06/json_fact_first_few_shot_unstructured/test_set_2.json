Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

The fact that the owner's bumper stickers had nothing to do with the quality of the paving work he provided is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement of a rational basis for the mayor's decision. B is incorrect. The owner's decision to put bumper stickers on his trucks was a decision to express his political views and to associate with others who shared those views. The First Amendment does not, however, require that the owner be permitted to impose his political views on his customers. C is incorrect. State law does not require that the lowest bidder be selected, so this answer is incorrect. D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land. Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here. Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue. Answer D is incorrect. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the taking serves a public purpose.",

The ex post facto clause is violated by laws that increase the punishment for a crime after the crime was committed, even if the law furthers a legitimate interest. Answer D is incorrect.

A company that owns many of the billboards affected by this ordinance has filed suit, claiming that the ordinance violates the company\u2019s freedom of speech.

C is incorrect because the ordinance does not meet the strict scrutiny standard required to uphold a content-based restriction on speech.

The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny.

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations is not the proper standard.

King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency.

That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment.

The man took a handgun and followed his neighbor to the county fairgrounds. When he had a clear shot, he aimed the gun and fired, but at the last second the neighbor moved. The shot missed the neighbor but struck and killed a police officer at the fairgrounds. The jurisdiction defines murder as at common law but creates three degrees of murder: (a) Capital murder, punishable by death, is the intentional murder of a police officer. (b) First-degree murder, punishable by life in prison, is premeditated and deliberate murder. (c) Second-degree murder, punishable by up to 40 years in prison, is all other murders. What is the most serious crime of which the man can properly be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Capital murder of the police officer.\nB. First-degree murder of the police officer.\nC. Second-degree murder of the police officer.\nD. Attempted murder of the neighbor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

A is incorrect because capital murder is only punishable by death, and the man should not be sentenced to death for the murder of the police officer. Although the police officer was a witness to the murder, that fact alone does not make the murder of a witness capital murder.

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

They connected the incidents because the vandal left specific graffiti at each site, and investigation provided the police with a reasonable suspicion that the perpetrator was a specific local resident. Using an online directory that the resident had joined, the police obtained the resident\u2019s cell- phone number. The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB. No, because the subpoena was based on a cell- phone number that the resident had voluntarily placed in the public domain.\nC. Yes, because a subpoena must be based on probable cause.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The person whose cell phone the data was collected from had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data, but that expectation was not violated because the data was collected from a third party - in this case, the cell phone company. The cell phone owner shared the data with the cell phone company, so that the cell phone company could provide the cell phone owner with the cell phone service that the owner desired. The cell phone owner did not share the data with the police, and thus did not give the police a basis for collecting it. B is incorrect. The fact that the cell phone owner placed his or her cell phone number in the public domain does not mean that the cell phone company can be compelled to disclose to the police any information it has about the owner's movements. The cell phone owner could have placed his or her cell phone number in the public domain by, for example, listing it in the online directory that was used by the police to obtain it. The cell phone company would not be permitted to disclose to the police any information about the owner's movements that it collected on its own. C is incorrect. The police had probable cause to believe that the cell phone owner was involved in the vandalism, and that was sufficient to support the issuance of the subpoena for the cell-phone data. D is incorrect. The warrant requirement does not apply to the collection of historical information. The police did not need a warrant to obtain the cell-phone company's records. The records are not the product of a search, and thus the warrant requirement does not apply."

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

C is incorrect. The man suffered a serious injury, and, even if he had not, the woman could not be convicted of aggravated assault on the basis of merely injuring another. D is correct. The woman was entitled to use deadly force to protect her property. The jury should be instructed accordingly."

Answer A is incorrect. The \u201cduty to retreat\u201d rule, which has been removed in most states, limits one\u2019s ability to use deadly force in self-defense. The rule does not apply in defense-of-property cases because in that context deadly force is categorically disallowed. Answer C is incorrect because the act described\u2014intentionally shooting a man with a shotgun\u2014clearly qualifies as \u201cdeadly force.\u201d Although states define the term in various ways, \u201cdeadly force\u201d is generally regarded as the kind of force that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death whether or not the serious bodily injury or death actually occurs. Answer D is incorrect because the woman used deadly force, not in defense of her dwelling or real property, but in defense of her personal property\u2014namely, her car and her laptop.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

Plain error occurs when there has been a serious mistake or omission at trial that affects the fairness or integrity of the proceeding. This mistake or omission must be so obvious that it cannot be reasonably debated, and must affect the rights of the defendant. The defendant in this case could not reasonably debate that the testimony should not have been admitted because it violated the Confrontation Clause. The testimony was admissible only because the defendant's counsel failed to object. Thus, the admission of the testimony constitutes plain error."

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct because, under the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, an appellate court may remedy an error that was plain or obvious if that error affected substantial rights. Here, the error was obvious, of constitutional dimension, and likely prejudicial. Consequently, the court of appeals has authority to reverse the conviction. Answer A is incorrect because, although a defendant\u2019s failure to object can change the standard of appellate review, it does not foreclose review. Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on direct appeal. For such errors, the defendant is not required to claim or prove ineffective assistance of counsel. Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, \u201cpenalized\u201d by an attorney\u2019s failure to object. Because the attorney did not object, the defendant must now meet the stringent requirements of the plain-error standard. Had the error been preserved by a contemporaneous objection, the standard of review would be more favorable to the defendant.",

The friend's reliance on the odometer reading was unreasonable, given that he had his mechanic check the car after he bought it and that the odometer reading was available to him when he bought the car. B is incorrect. The fact that the seller was unaware of the car's actual mileage does not affect the buyer's ability to avoid the contract. C is incorrect. The buyer's failure to check the odometer before he bought the car does not make the car's actual mileage a material fact. The friend could have, but did not, ask the seller about the car's mileage. The fact that the buyer did not inquire about the mileage or check the odometer himself means that he accepted the car on the basis of its appearance and the seller's representations about it. D is incorrect. The car's odometer reading does not constitute a warranty.

Before the subcontractor performed, it discovered that it had made an error in computing the size of the foundation and should have quoted the general contractor $18,000 for the work. The subcontractor informed the general contractor of the mistake and asked whether the general contractor would agree to pay $15,000 for the foundation, which would cover the subcontractor\u2019s costs. After determining that other subcontractors would charge at least $18,000 for the work, the general contractor agreed in writing. When the work was completed, the general contractor tendered the subcontractor $12,000. The subcontractor refused to accept the payment. If the subcontractor prevails in a suit against the general contractor, how much will the subcontractor be likely to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $12,000, because the contract modification was not supported by consideration.\nB. $12,000, because the subcontractor\u2019s mistake was unilateral.\nC. $15,000, because the contract modification was fair and equitable under the circumstances.\nD. $18,000, because that is the value of the benefit the subcontractor conferred on the general contractor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "B is correct. The non-occurrence of a specified condition will discharge a contractual obligation only where the non-occurrence has not been contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the contract. Where a party has made a unilateral mistake, causing him or her to fail to fulfill a condition necessary to his or her obligation under a contract, the other party may, at his or her option, either refuse to accept the performance or, if he or she has relied on the other party's failure, rescind the contract. In this case, the subcontractor's mistake was unilateral, and the general contractor could have either accepted the $18,000 foundation or refused to accept it. Because the general contractor accepted the $18,000 foundation, he cannot now claim that the subcontractor breached the contract and is entitled to damages. A is incorrect. The failure of consideration is not a valid defense to a suit on a contract. B is incorrect. The fact that the subcontractor's mistake was unilateral is not sufficient, on its own, to support a finding that the contractor's obligation was discharged automatically. C is incorrect. A court will refuse to enforce a contract modification if it does not serve the mutual interests of the parties. In this case, the subcontractor's $18,000 modification served his interest, but did not serve the general contractor's interest, because he wanted the cheaper foundation. D is incorrect. The value of the benefit conferred by the subcontractor on the general contractor is not a sufficient measure of damages where, as here, the subcontractor has refused to accept the general contractor's payment. The general contractor should instead calculate the excess cost he incurred as a result of the subcontractor's failure to meet the contract specification."

Although there was no consideration for the modification, under the modern rule of Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 89, a modification is binding \u201cif the modification is fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the contract was made.\u201d Answer A is incorrect. This is the answer under the pre-existing duty rule, but that rule does not apply when a modification is fair and equitable in light of changed circumstances. Answer B is incorrect.

The issue of whether the owner had a right to enter the house after the tenant abandoned it without giving notice is a matter of contract interpretation, and the answer depends upon the language of the lease. The lease is silent as to whether the owner had a right to enter the premises after the tenant abandoned it. Since the lease is silent on the issue, the owner's right to enter the premises is determined by the objective theory of contracts. Under this theory, the meaning of the lease is determined by what a reasonable person would have understood the language of the lease to mean. Since the lease is silent on the issue of whether the owner had a right to enter the premises, the meaning of the lease is ambiguous.

Since the lease is silent on the issue of whether the owner had a right to enter the premises, the meaning of the provision is ambiguous, and the court will turn to extrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of the provision.

The builder will recover nothing, because he materially breached the contract.\nB. The builder will recover the reasonable value of his work.\nC. The builder will recover in restitution the amount by which the bathroom increased the value of the homeowner\u2019s house, not to exceed $30,000.\nD. The builder will recover $30,000, because the contract is divisible into two parts.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A is correct. Where a party materially breaches a contract, the non-breaching party may elect to reject all performance or to accept partial performance and claim damages for the breach. In this case, the builder materially breached the contract because he failed to complete the job according to the contract. The homeowner was entitled to reject the builder's performance after he ceased work on the second bathroom. Thus, B, C and D are incorrect."

According to the rule of divisible contract, when performance under a contract can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed, one party\u2019s performance of a task triggers the other party\u2019s duty to pay for it, even when the performing party breaches another part of the contract.

When it is applicable, as here, the rule of divisible contract provides a way to fairly compensate a party who has materially breached a contract. Answers B and C are incorrect. As discussed above, when a breaching party can recover under the rule of divisible contract, it is not necessary to look to restitution to provide a remedy.",

The prosecutor wishes to introduce into evidence a ledger found at the defendant\u2019s home during the execution of a search warrant. The ledger includes detailed information regarding the defendant\u2019s purchases and sales of drugs over a two-year period. The prosecutor is considering two alternative ways to lay the foundation for admission of the ledger as a business record. The first alternative is to call the police officer who executed the search warrant to testify that she found the ledger in the defendant\u2019s home. The second alternative is to call a codefendant, who has pled guilty, to testify that he was the defendant\u2019s drug supplier for over two years and that he was present when the defendant used the ledger to record their transactions as well as transactions with other buyers and sellers as they occurred. Which of the following is correct regarding the ledger\u2019s admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ledger may be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant.\nB. The ledger may be admitted through the codefendant but not through the officer.\nC. The ledger may not be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant, because business records may be introduced only through testimony by a records custodian.\nD. The ledger may not be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant, because the business records exception to the hearsay rule does not apply to illegal activity.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation. Answer D is incorrect. The trial judge has the discretion to alter the order of proof without a showing of specific prejudice by an opposing party.",

One trial witness was a child who had seen one of the killings. Before calling the child to testify, the prosecution moved to remove the defendant from the courtroom, arguing that the child would be intimidated by seeing the defendant. The court denied the motion. When the child entered the courtroom to testify, the defendant became unruly, moving as though he was about to lunge from his chair toward the child. The judge warned the defendant to stop the behavior. After a second warning, the judge told the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to behave inappropriately. The defendant then shouted a threat at the child. At that point, the court ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom. When the child finished testifying, subject to full cross-examination by defense counsel, the defendant was allowed back into the courtroom. The trial concluded, and the jury convicted the defendant. The defendant appealed the conviction, challenging only his exclusion from the courtroom. Should the court of appeals reverse the conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a defendant may be excluded from the courtroom to protect a minor witness from further trauma.\nB. No, because the right to be present can be forfeited by disruptive behavior.\nC. Yes, because the error requires automatic reversal.\nD. Yes, unless the error in excluding the defendant was harmless.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The Constitution requires unanimity among the jurors before a defendant can be convicted of murder. If the jury believed the child's testimony, it would be impossible to secure a conviction. B is incorrect. The defendant was allowed to remain in the courtroom after he ceased his disruptive behavior. The fact that the defendant was removed after he made a threatening gesture toward the child is sufficient to support an exclusionary rule. C is incorrect. The Constitution does not require that automatic reversal be given for any error. Here, automatic reversal is not warranted because the defendant was allowed to remain in the courtroom after he ceased his disruptive behavior. D is incorrect. The error does not require automatic reversal because the defendant was allowed to remain in the courtroom after he ceased his disruptive behavior. The jury could have found that the defendant's presence in the courtroom did not affect the child's testimony."

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b)(4) states that in order to have a scheduling order modified, the moving party must show \u201cgood cause.\u201d This requires a showing that the party acted diligently to try to meet the original deadline. Answer B is incorrect. If the moving party shows good cause, the court can amend any of the dates or deadlines in the scheduling order, including the trial date or the date for jury selection. Answer C is incorrect. Whether additional time could facilitate a settlement is immaterial, because it does not speak to whether the moving party can show the required diligence needed to establish good cause. Answer D is incorrect. The busy schedule of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not establish the good cause needed to amend the scheduling order, which is why the motion should be denied. A party opposing a requested extension would need to show prejudice that would likely result from the extension only if the moving party had first met its burden to show good cause.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a judgment on the pleadings may be made after the pleadings are closed. However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be premature.",

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

There is no federal question jurisdiction and the state law claim does not present a substantial federal constitutional question. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that there is no final judgment, but it is incorrect that an interlocutory appeal can be taken from such a judgment. There is no such thing as a discretionary interlocutory appeal. D is correct. The federal court does not have diversity jurisdiction and the state law claim has not been fully adjudicated.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As the state-law claim remains to be decided in the action, there is not yet a final judgment on the merits of the entire action, and thus an appeal is not allowed under the final judgment rule. Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Answer C is incorrect. To obtain a discretionary interlocutory appeal, the party seeking to appeal must apply to both the district and appellate courts to meet the statutory standards. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Because the scientist has appealed without attempting to satisfy that requirement, the appeal cannot be treated as a discretionary interlocutory appeal. Answer D is incorrect. Under the final judgment rule, a judgment is not final until all the claims in the action have been resolved. While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. A buyer is on constructive notice of all information that a search of the land records would reveal. At issue is whether the entrepreneur had record (constructive) notice of the restriction. If so, the entrepreneur would not be a good-faith purchaser for value. Courts are divided about whether a buyer is required to search deeds outside of the chain of title to the land the buyer is purchasing. Here, the deed from the man to the woman is outside of the entrepreneur\u2019s chain of title even though they share a common grantor. Thus, knowing whether the jurisdiction\u2019s law puts a buyer on notice of all land transfers of the buyer\u2019s grantor, even those outside of the chain of title, is essential. If it does, the entrepreneur had a duty to search the title for the westerly tract. Answer A is incorrect. The type of index does not determine what instruments are in the chain of title. Answer B is incorrect. The recording system does not affect whether the entrepreneur is a good-faith purchaser for value. Answer D is incorrect. The intended use of the land does not affect the determination of whether the entrepreneur was aware of the recorded restriction.",

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The neighbor is required to get the man's permission to relocate the easement, and the man is entitled to impose whatever conditions he wishes on the neighbor's use of the land. The man has not restricted the neighbor's use of the land in the past, but he can do so in the future. B is incorrect. The neighbor's not informing the man that she wanted to relocate the easement is not a sufficient reason to find that the neighbor did not intend to relocate the easement. The neighbor had the right to use the man's land as a shortcut, and the man did not restrict that use. The grant of the easement was by deed of gift, and therefore consideration was not given for the grant. The time, place, and manner of the use of the gifted property were left to the donee's (the neighbor's) discretion. Over the years, the neighbor used the 15-foot strip along the west side of the man's land as a shortcut. The man did not object and did not restrict the neighbor's use of the land. Therefore, the time, place, and manner of the use of the land were left to the neighbor's discretion.

Two years later, at a time when the land remained vacant, the developer took out a second mortgage loan from an investor to construct self-storage units on the land. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order in which they were executed. The developer made all payments on both mortgage loans for several years but eventually defaulted on the loan from the seller, who threatened to initiate foreclosure proceedings. To avoid the foreclosure, the developer executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure conveying the land back to the seller. But before the developer delivered the deed to the seller, it notified the investor of the proposed conveyance and gave her the option to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan. The investor declined to do so, and the developer delivered the deed to the seller. If nothing else has happened since the conveyance to the seller, is the investor\u2019s mortgage still valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the investor declined to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan.\nB. No, because the seller\u2019s mortgage was a purchase money mortgage.\nC.

In this case, the investor had the option to cure the developer's default on the seller's loan and failed to do so, so the investor's mortgage was extinguished to the extent of the developer's default. B is incorrect. Whether a mortgage is a purchase money mortgage depends upon whether the mortgagor obtained the mortgaged property by purchase or whether the mortgage was given to secure a debt contracted to purchase the property. Here, the developer purchased the land from the seller and gave the seller a mortgage to secure the purchase price.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other.

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter.

Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death.

Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect. There is no rule of tort law stating that a plaintiff is prohibited from pursuing claims for battery and products liability on the basis of the same set of facts.",

The construction company mixed the sand with water and cement to make concrete. The distributor knew that an improper ratio of sand, water, and cement would result in defective concrete, but the distributor played no role in determining the ratio used by the construction company in mixing the concrete. The construction company used the concrete to form supporting columns for a building. A year later, the building collapsed during a minor earthquake, causing injury to the occupants. Although the sand was not defective, the concrete forming the columns was defective because the mixture ratio of the sand, water, and cement was not proper. The defective concrete was a cause in fact of the collapse. Do the injured building occupants have viable strict liability claims against the sand distributor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because component suppliers are not strictly liable in tort.\nB. No, because the distributor neither advised nor participated with the construction company in determining the mixture of sand, water, and cement.\nC. Yes, because the concrete columns were defective.\nD. Yes, because the distributor knew that an improper mixture of sand, water, and cement would result in defective concrete.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a finished product by the product\u2019s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the component is what rendered the finished product defective. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 5 (1998). In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer A is incorrect. The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met). Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer D is incorrect.

Prior to setting off a charge, the blasting company supervisor posted a large warning sign and stationed a flagman to stop automobiles along the highway. Although a motorist saw and understood both the sign and the flagman\u2019s instruction to stop, the motorist nonetheless continued past the flagman and the sign and was traveling along the highway at the moment of the blast. A flying rock from the blast hit and severely damaged the motorist\u2019s car. The jurisdiction follows the traditional common law rules governing contributory negligence and assumption of risk. If the motorist pursues a claim against the blasting company to recover for the damage to the car, and all the foregoing facts are established, how much should the motorist recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The full value of the car.\nB. The full cost of restoring the car to its condition just before the accident.\nC.

Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle. The supervisor told the dispatcher that he should quit if he couldn\u2019t handle the increased hours. Over the next three months, the dispatcher continued to complain about the working conditions, to no effect. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury. He eventually was hospitalized and had to miss several months of work as a result of the emotional distress. The dispatcher sued the trucking company for negligence. The company has moved for summary judgment, based on the undisputed facts set out above. Assume that there is no applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute. How should the court rule on the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny the motion, because the jury must determine the extent of the emotional distress suffered by the dispatcher.\nB.

Summary judgment is appropriately denied when there is evidence of the existence of an injury that would not necessarily have resulted in death or serious physical harm. A jury could reasonably find that the dispatcher suffered an emotional injury that resulted in his hospitalization and absence from work for several months. B is incorrect. The supervisor\u2019s liability, if any, turns on whether he acted with ordinary care in responding to the dispatcher\u2019s complaints. The dispatcher\u2019s hospitalization and absence from work for several months are evidence that the supervisor may have failed to act with ordinary care. C is incorrect. The dispatcher\u2019s emotional distress resulting in his hospitalization and absence from work for several months is sufficient evidence of a physical injury to defeat a motion for summary judgment. D is incorrect. There is uncontradicted evidence that the supervisor did not act with malice or ill will. Thus, a jury could not reasonably find that the supervisor acted with the intent to cause emotional distress or with reckless indifference toward the dispatcher\u2019s welfare. The supervisor\u2019s liability, if any, would be based on negligence. Because the dispatcher worked for the trucking company, a jury could find that the supervisor had a duty to take reasonable measures to ensure the dispatcher\u2019s emotional well-being. The supervisor breached that duty where he failed to take reasonable measures to respond to the dispatcher\u2019s complaints. A jury could reasonably find that the supervisor\u2019s failure to provide a reasonable response to the dispatcher\u2019s complaints caused the dispatcher\u2019s emotional distress and hospitalization.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Negligently caused emotional distress is ordinarily not actionable unless connected to a physical injury. Answer A is incorrect. Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty.

            "explanation": "D is correct. In a negligence action, the plaintiff must allege duty, breach, causation and damages. The issue of whether a defendant had a duty to take a certain action is generally a question of law. Whether a defendant breached that duty is generally a question of fact. However, whether a defendant warned against a certain danger is an issue of fact only if the plaintiff can prove that the defendant was aware of the danger. If the defendant did not know about the danger, then it was not negligent in failing to warn against it. Thus, answer D is correct, and answer A is incorrect. The rarity of the daughter's allergy will not affect whether the defendant had a duty to warn against the ingredient. Answer B is incorrect. The issue of whether a manufacturer had a duty to warn against a particular danger is a question of law, and this answer would be correct if the plaintiff had alleged that the manufacturer had a duty to warn against a particular danger.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

After the couple brought the RV home, but before they had moved any personal property into it, the RV spontaneously caught fire and was completely destroyed. Does the couple have a viable strict products liability claim against the manufacturer of the RV?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the damage was only to the RV itself.\nB. No, because there is no indication that the manufacturer was negligent.\nC. Yes, because a new RV will not spontaneously catch fire in the absence of negligence by its manufacturer.\nD. Yes, because the RV was obviously defective and the manufacturer should be held strictly liable for the damage caused by the defect.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A is correct. A strict product liability claim does not arise from a tort. Torts are based on negligence or other malfeasance. Since the RV was destroyed and no one was injured, this is not a tort and thus a strict product liability claim cannot be made. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that strict liability is not a tort. However, it is incorrect to say that there is no indication that the manufacturer was negligent. The fact that the RV spontaneously combusted is an indication that the manufacturer was negligent in its design or manufacture. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the RV cannot spontaneously combust without human intervention. However, it is incorrect to say that this means the manufacturer cannot be held strictly liable. The manufacturer can be held strictly liable for the negligent design or manufacture of the RV. D is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the RV was obviously defective. However, it is incorrect to say that the manufacturer should be held strictly liable. The manufacturer can be held liable for the negligent design or manufacture of the RV."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A rule of products liability law states that there is no recovery if a defect in a product causes damage only to the product itself (as opposed to personal injury, or injury to other property). This rule is sometimes referred to as the \u201ceconomic loss rule.\u201d In such cases, the owner of the damaged product is limited to contract remedies. Answer B is incorrect. The absence of negligence on the part of the manufacturer does not provide a basis for denying recovery to the couple on a strict products liability claim. Answer C is incorrect. Recovery on a strict products liability claim does not depend on whether the evidence supports an inference of manufacturer negligence. Answer D is incorrect for the reasons stated in the explanation for answer A.",

Under the sponsorship agreement, the dealership was required to arrange for licensed and trained emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to be present during the race. The dealership contracted with a licensed and reputable emergency medical services (EMS) firm that supplied EMTs for events such as these. A motorcyclist participating in the race was injured when he lost control of his motorcycle. The motorcyclist was treated at the scene by the EMTs. In removing the motorcyclist\u2019s helmet, one of the EMTs twisted the motorcyclist\u2019s neck, causing him to become permanently paralyzed. The motorcyclist has sued both the EMS firm and the dealership, alleging that the EMT\u2019s careless conduct caused his paralysis. Assuming the validity of the motorcyclist\u2019s negligence claim against the EMS firm, which of the following best characterizes the dealership\u2019s potential liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The dealership is directly liable for hiring the EMS firm.\nB. The dealership is vicariously liable, because it owed a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care for the race.\nC. The dealership is vicariously liable, because the EMT was careless in the course of her employment.\nD. The dealership is neither directly liable nor vicariously liable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The dealership did not hire the EMS firm. The dealership contracted with the EMS firm, which is a common practice in the industry. B is correct. Under the facts of this case, the dealership has a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care for the race. This duty is nondelegable because it is imposed by the sponsorship agreement and cannot be delegated to another party. C is incorrect. C is incorrect. The EMT was not careless in the course of her employment with the EMS firm. The EMT was careless in the course of her duties as an EMT. D is correct. D is correct. Neither answer A, B, nor C is correct. The dealership is not directly liable for the EMT's negligence because the EMT was employed by the EMS firm. The dealership is also not vicariously liable for the EMT's negligence because the EMT's negligence was not the proximate cause of the motorcyclist's injuries. The motorcyclist was injured when the EMT twisted his neck. The EMT's negligent conduct was the proximate cause of the motorcyclist's neck injury. However, the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by the EMT's careless conduct in removing his helmet. The EMT's removal of the helmet was a necessary step in providing the motorcyclist with the necessary emergency care. The EMT's removal of the helmet was a substantial factor in causing the motorcyclist's injuries. The EMT's negligence was not the proximate cause of the motorcyclist's injuries. Therefore, answer D is correct."

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. Because the dealership\u2019s duty of care was delegable, because the dealership was not negligent in hiring the EMS firm, and because the EMT was not an employee of the dealership, there is no basis for holding the dealership liable, whether directly or vicariously. Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is also no basis for direct liability. Answer B is incorrect. The duty to provide competent medical care was properly delegated to the EMS firm. Answer C is incorrect. Because the EMT was an employee only of the EMS firm, not the dealership, any carelessness by the EMT could be imputed only to the EMS firm.",
