            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

The second defendant was a citizen of State C, and the first defendant was a citizen of State B. The second defendant was timely served with the amended complaint and consent to removal was obtained from the first defendant. The plaintiff argues that removal was not proper because the first defendant was a citizen of the forum state and could not consent to removal. However, the key factor in determining whether removal is proper is whether the case meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, which is based on the citizenship of the parties and not the state in which the court is located.",
                "Rule_application": "Federal courts have diversity jurisdiction over cases where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the matter in controversy is between parties who are citizens of different states. Removal is proper if the original lawsuit was filed in state court and the requirements for diversity jurisdiction are met at the time of removal. The amendment of the complaint to add the second defendant does not affect the court's diversity jurisdiction as long as the original parties met the requirements for diversity at the time the first defendant consented to removal.",
                "Legal_conclusion": "Given that the original parties met the requirements for diversity jurisdiction when the first defendant consented to removal, the court would likely find that removal was proper based on the addition of the second defendant and a related federal-law claim."

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h) permits litigants to raise personal-jurisdiction challenges for the first time in an answer that is amended as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1). Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants. Answer D is incorrect. Personal service under Rule 4 can occur at any location, not just the person\u2019s home.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Although a request for waiver of service was sent, the defendant was not obligated to and did not respond to the request. Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party.

Because the defendant did not object to any of the instructions, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51(d)(2) provides that the defendant\u2019s appeal can only be successful if the instruction affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, which is the standard for plain error. Answer B is incorrect. There is no obligation to seek a new trial before challenging jury instructions on appeal, so long as the applicable plain error standard can be satisfied. Plain error is the standard because the defendant failed to object at trial. Answer C is incorrect. Plain error, not abuse of discretion, is the standard for reviewing instructions that the parties did not object to, as was the case here. Answer D is incorrect. The errors were not waived by the failure to object. Rather, the failure to object waived full review, with the result that the standard for assigning error was raised to plain error.",

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC. The court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law because he implicitly assumed the risk of the manager\u2019s carelessness.\nD.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery.

The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent.

Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB.

The rule is a valid exercise of the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power, because the manner of pleading defenses is an issue that can rationally be classified as procedure and the rule itself regulates the manner and means by which the parties\u2019 rights are enforced.

Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim.

Congress cannot constitutionally intrude on the President's exclusive authority to remove executive branch officials, including those appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. Therefore, the President's removal of the director would be constitutional as long as it does not violate the Constitution's requirement for the advice and consent of the Senate for certain principal officers."

United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), and Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986). Answer A is incorrect. A series of Supreme Court cases beginning with Myers sharply limits Congress\u2019s ability to impose conditions on the removal of federal officials.   Answer B is incorrect. Myers and subsequent cases make it clear that the Senate has no role in the removal of federal officers other than via impeachment. Answer D is incorrect because it is an overbroad statement of the law. The Supreme Court has upheld the power of Congress to remove certain types of federal officials, such as those serving as members of the governing bodies of regulatory agencies and inferior officers in agencies where the head of the agency is removable by the President at will.",

The purpose of the due process hearing would be to determine whether the resident was in arrears. Answer C is incorrect. Private entities performing a public function are state actors only if the function is an exclusively governmental service or one that involves inherently governmental powers such as incarceration.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect.

The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm.

The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC. Yes, because punitive damages awards are not authorized unless there is proof of willful or wanton misconduct on the defendant\u2019s part.\nD.

This means that a 7:1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutional if the defendant's actions were extreme and outrageous. In this scenario, the radiologist's actions were negligent and contributed to the patient's death due to advanced lung cancer.

When the buyer answered, the employee explained that he was there to repossess the car and asked for the car keys.

The employee declined the request, explaining to the buyer that any possessions in the car could be reclaimed from the company after the car was repossessed.

This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect.

On the day he arrived, just after sunset, he took his bag upstairs to a second-floor bedroom and unpacked. As he was about to head back downstairs, he realized that the stairwell had become too dark to navigate without a light. The man spent about 30 seconds feeling the walls at the top of the stairwell but could not find a light switch. In fact, the switch was located in an awkward position not reachable without descending to the second step. Although he recognized the danger of descending an unfamiliar staircase in darkness, the man started down the stairs. He lost his footing halfway down, fell, and was seriously injured. The man has sued the owner of the beach house for negligence. The jurisdiction recognizes the traditional common law defense of assumption of risk. If the action proceeds to trial, which of the following would be an appropriate (paraphrased) instruction for the court to give to the jury?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling on the darkened stairs, then you must assign a percentage of responsibility to the man.\u201d\nB. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling on the darkened stairs, then you must find for the owner.\u201d\nC. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man was a mere licensee, then you must find for the owner.\u201d\nD. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, then you may in your discretion award the man both compensatory and punitive damages.\u201d\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

Evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to flee satisfies FRE 401\u2019s definition of relevance: it shows his consciousness of guilt and makes his guilt more probable than it would be without the evidence. Answer A is incorrect. FRE 401 defines relevance as evidence having \u201cany tendency to make a fact [of consequence] more probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evidence that the defendant tried to flee from prosecution\u2014that he purchased an airplane ticket to another country using an alias\u2014satisfies the definition of relevance, because it shows his consciousness of guilt. Answer B is incorrect. Evidence of an intent to flee is relevant to show the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt but not to show his motive to commit the crime. The defendant\u2019s attempt to flee the jurisdiction after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime. Answer D is incorrect. Proof of motive is generally relevant and admissible, but evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to flee after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime. Because the evidence is irrelevant to motive, it is inadmissible if offered to prove motive.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph \u201cis what the proponent claims it is.\u201d The witness\u2019s proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw it.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying. Here, the defendant\u2019s purpose for his wrongful conduct (killing the declarant) was revenge for a theft and not a desire to prevent trial testimony. Therefore, the prosecutor cannot make the showing of intent required for forfeiture of either objection. Answers A and B are incorrect for the reasons set out above.   Answer D is incorrect. The federal courts have held that a trial judge may find the threshold requirements for forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. Further, the preponderance standard applies to the trial judge\u2019s determinations on preliminary questions of admissibility under FRE 104(a).",

An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103. In addition, the delayed objection failed to preserve the right to appeal, because the defense attorney did not state a specific basis for the objection under FRE 103. Answer A is incorrect. Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103. Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect. An objection must be made at the earliest opportunity under FRE 103, and an objection that is made \u201cduring trial\u201d but not while the witness is still on the stand is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.",

Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

The broker did not produce a ready, willing, and able buyer during the term of the listing agreement because the offer was for an amount less than the listing price in the listing agreement. The broker was not involved in the sale of the house after the listing agreement had expired. Answer D is incorrect. The woman was not required to give a reason for rejecting an offer for an amount less than the listing price made during the listing period.",

Seventeen years ago, the city discontinued using the land as a park. Because the city needed additional parking for nearby city buildings, it paved the land and has used it as a parking lot ever since.

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement. Under the applicable statute, the degree of the crime (and, hence, the severity of the authorized punishment) depends upon the value of the property embezzled. Of what crime, if any, could the woman properly be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Embezzlement of $200,000.\nB. Embezzlement of $100,000.\nC. Embezzlement of $80,000.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled. Answer D is incorrect because the woman did embezzle $100,000; see the explanation for answer B.",

Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more.

The man did nothing but offer to pay, and this conduct is not \u201cdangerously proximate\u201d to the commission of the offense as required by the common law. Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony. Additionally, the facts do not establish a misprision. That offense   occurs when a person fails to inform the authorities about a felony that the person knows about.",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n{\n        \"domain\": \"Criminal_law\",\n        \"chosen_option_label\": \"B\",\n        \"explanation\": {\n            \"Legal_concept\": \"Self-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\",\n            \"Fact_analysis\": \"The husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside.

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Yes, because defense counsel is required to present any known mitigating factors in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
