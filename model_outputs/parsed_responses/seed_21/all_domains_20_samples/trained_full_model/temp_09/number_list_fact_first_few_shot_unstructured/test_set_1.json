The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3.

            "question_number": 1,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The complaint set out the bank\u2019s method of calculating interest and alleged that the method violated both federal banking law and state contract law. The bank filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that its method of calculating interest, as described in the complaint, was proper under federal law and that the federal law preempted the depositor\u2019s state-law claim. The court granted the motion to dismiss the depositor\u2019s federal claim and reserved ruling on the motion to dismiss the state-law claim.

This answer correctly states that the court may hear the state-law claim if it is so related to the federal claim that they form part of the same case or controversy. However, this answer is incorrect because the facts of the scenario do not support that relation. The state-law claim was pending when the federal claim was dismissed; therefore, the state-law claim does not \"arise out of\" the federal claim. Moreover, the depositor seeks less than the minimum amount in controversy for federal diversity purposes, which is $75,000. The court should not hear the state-law claim."

            "question_number": 7,
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

The amended complaint asserted the $120,000 state-law claim and a related federal-law claim against both defendants. Twenty-five days after service of the amended complaint, the second defendant removed the action to a federal court in State B with the first defendant\u2019s consent. Was removal proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the first defendant was a citizen of the forum state.\nB. No, because the notice of removal was untimely.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Under the federal removal statute, any nondiverse defendant may prevent removal to federal court by serving a notice of intent to stay in the federal court. Here, the second defendant, a citizen of State C, timely filed such a notice. Because the federal court has diversity jurisdiction in this case, removal from the state court was proper. A is incorrect because, even if removal were permissible, the first defendant would be a citizen of the forum state and thus the federal court would not have diversity jurisdiction. B is incorrect because the 30-day statute of limitations for removal does not apply to a case originally filed in state court."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. An action is removable if it could have been originally filed in federal court. Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

The defendant travels to State A once each year for a weeklong vacation but has no other State A contacts. The defendant answered, denying all allegations. One week later, the defendant filed an amended answer, denying all allegations and including the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. State A has a long-arm statute that permits personal jurisdiction to the constitutional limit. The defendant has moved for an order dismissing the action based on the personal-jurisdiction challenge asserted in the amended answer. Should the court issue the order?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant waived the challenge to personal jurisdiction by failing to include it in her original answer.\nB. No, because the defendant was personally served with process within 100 miles of the federal courthouse where the action is pending.\nC.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h) permits litigants to raise personal-jurisdiction challenges for the first time in an answer that is amended as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1). Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants. Answer D is incorrect. Personal service under Rule 4 can occur at any location, not just the person\u2019s home.

In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request.

Thus, a judicial panel of the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the actions are pending may, upon timely motion, transfer any action to any other district or division of that circuit where such action may be maintained if it is evident that such action will be managed in such other district or division for the advantage of the parties and the interest of justice. Here, because all of the passengers were injured in the same incident and the actions involve common questions of fact, the actions should be transferred to the judicial district in which the accident occurred so that the actions may be efficiently and conveniently conducted."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

After several members were arrested, the organization\u2019s leader called for \u201ceven bigger demonstrations next week to halt operations at the base.\u201d The US Attorney in the jurisdiction brought a federal civil action against the organization and its leader, seeking an injunction against protests that interfered with the base\u2019s operations. With the complaint, the US Attorney moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to \u201cenjoin any blockade of the base\u2019s entrance or other disruption of base activity until the court can hear motions for a preliminary and a permanent injunction.\u201d The US Attorney attached an affidavit certifying the unsuccessful efforts she had made to locate the organization and its leader and to notify them of the motion. The court immediately held a hearing and issued the TRO in a one-sentence order that did not describe the acts to be restrained but instead incorporated by reference the allegations of the complaint and the TRO motion.

The competitor opposed the motion on the ground that the statutory limitations period had expired. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery has closed, and the competitor will be prejudiced.\nB. No, because the amendment would not relate back and thus would be futile.\nC.

Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock.

            "explanation": "A is correct. This question asks for the unambiguous language of the relevant statute defining the term \"substantial compliance.\" For example, in New York, the statute provides that \"substantial compliance\" means that the form of the notice \"shall be substantially in accordance with the statutory requirements.\" N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3215(e). Thus, because the notice in this case substantially complied with the statutory requirements, the plaintiff has not met the requirement of showing that the defendant received notice. B is incorrect. The court should not deny the defendant's motion because it is the defendant's motion and because the defendant has shown that the plaintiff received notice in a manner that substantially complied with the requirements of the statute. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the defendant's motion should be granted, but it misstates the legal basis for that decision. The defendant's motion should be granted because the plaintiff received notice in a manner that substantially complied with the requirements of the statute. D is incorrect. The friend has not assumed the risk of the manager\u2019s negligence, and this answer incorrectly states that the friend has assumed the risk.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery.

The general federal rule is that when a motion to dismiss for insufficient (inadequate) notice is made, the court will presume that the moving party has met its burden and the party resisting the motion (here, the tenant) has the burden of showing that the notice was sufficient. The burden of showing that the notice was sufficient is a burden of persuasion, not a burden of production or a burden of going beyond the pleadings. Thus, the tenant will not be taken at her word that she provided adequate notice. She will be required to present evidence in support of her claim that she provided adequate notice.

The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The fact that the governor was arrested pursuant to a federal warrant, and that he is being held in a federal facility, does not deprive the state court of jurisdiction to hear the habeas action. Thus, Answer D is correct, and the writ should be granted. Answer A is incorrect because the federal magistrate who issued the warrant was well within his power to do so; the fact that the governor is being held in a federal facility does not, on its own, make the federal court's jurisdiction illicit. Answer B is incorrect because the fact that the governor was arrested pursuant to a federal warrant defeats any claim that the federal court lacks jurisdiction. Answer C is incorrect because there is no constitutional provision that prohibits the federal government from extending its jurisdiction to state officials."

            "explanation": "C is correct. While the First Amendment protects the media from certain types of state interference in the production and dissemination of news, it does not provide a privilege against the liability for defamation or breach of contract. Thus, the court will not grant the reporter\u2019s motion to dismiss simply because the lawsuit involves the freedom of the press. Whether state contract law applies to the situation is important because it will determine whether the daughter is a private contractor or a state actor. If the daughter is a private contractor, then state contract law applies and the daughter is entitled to recover damages for breach of contract. If the daughter is a state actor, then the First Amendment will be the only basis on which she can recover damages. Because the daughter is not a state actor, the court should deny the reporter\u2019s motion to dismiss. B is incorrect because the First Amendment is not the only basis on which the daughter can recover damages.

United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), and Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986). Answer A is incorrect. A series of Supreme Court cases beginning with Myers sharply limits Congress\u2019s ability to impose conditions on the removal of federal officials.   Answer B is incorrect. Myers and subsequent cases make it clear that the Senate has no role in the removal of federal officers other than via impeachment. Answer D is incorrect because it is an overbroad statement of the law. The Supreme Court has upheld the power of Congress to remove certain types of federal officials, such as those serving as members of the governing bodies of regulatory agencies and inferior officers in agencies where the head of the agency is removable by the President at will.",

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

First, he will spend half of the money to train troops. Second, he will retain the remaining funds in the federal treasury and not spend them at all.

Here, the President is using his power to veto an unconstitutional federal statute by refusing to expend the appropriated funds. Congress has no veto power over executive actions, so Congress cannot override the President's veto. B is incorrect. This answer correctly determines that the President's decision to spend the funds to train troops is constitutional. However, it is not necessary that the President spend the money on anything else because, as explained below, it is constitutional for the President to refuse to spend appropriated monies if he determines the purpose for which the money was appropriated is unconstitutional. C is incorrect. The Constitution does not authorize Congress to veto executive branch actions by withholding appropriated funds. Thus, if the President determines that the purpose for which the money was appropriated is unconstitutional, it is constitutional for the President to refuse to spend the monies, and, accordingly, this answer is incorrect. D is incorrect. Neither of the President's decisions is unconstitutional."

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Thus, the company is a state actor and the Fourteenth Amendment applies. B is incorrect. whether a party has a property interest in a particular benefit or entitlement depends upon whether the government has promised that the party will continue to receive the benefit or entitlement in the future.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

Because the requirement is discriminatory in its impact, and there is no compelling government interest to justify the disparate impact, the requirement will violate the equal protection clause. The other possible answer choices are incorrect. The requirement of sterilization does not deprive any group of a fundamental right, because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the right to procreate is not a fundamental right under the Constitution. Nor is there a compelling government interest here; requiring someone to be sterilized after committing a crime is not necessary to serve a compelling government interest. And, the requirement of sterilization has a disparate impact on racial minorities; the fact that the requirement is discriminatory in its impact, combined with the fact that the groups affected are racial minorities, means that answer C is incorrect."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect. It states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not applicable in this case.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The Constitution authorizes Congress to tax federal agencies \"to regulate commerce ... among the several states.\" U.S. Supreme Court case law has interpreted this provision as authorizing Congress to vestsuch taxing authority in federal agencies so that they may perform their constitutional functions. Pursuant to this authority, Congress has vested the collection of the tax in the Internal Revenue Service, which is an agency of the federal government. Therefore, the tax falls within the scope of this constitutional grant of authority and is within the scope of Congress' spending power. A is incorrect. The Constitution prohibits discrimination against the federal government in the ways in which it spends money. But this prohibition is limited to discrimination against the federal government in the ways in which it spends money within a particular state. It does not apply where, as here, the tax is imposed on all leases of real estate. B is incorrect. This constitutional provision authorizing Congress to tax the federal government is known as the federal enclave doctrine. This provision, however, is only one of several constitutional provisions that bear on the issue of whether a state may tax an arm of the federal government. The federal prohibition on such a tax, known as the anti-aid clause, is found in the Constitution's supremacy clause. Thus, B is incorrect."

Pursuant to UCC \u00a7 2-104(2) and case law, where the circumstances do not make it unconscionable, a contract may be formed by performance of a promise to do a certain thing in the future without any statement of the terms. Thus, the plumber\u2019s performance of the promise to unclog the drain formed a contract with the homeowner. The homeowner\u2019s refusal to pay the full amount due under the contract, combined with the fact that the parties did not discuss price when they contracted, leads to the conclusion that the original agreement was a contract with no agreed price. Pursuant to UCC \u00a7 2-107(2) and case law, a contract with no agreed price may be either a contract with a price to be fixed later or a contract with no price specified. A contract with no agreed price may also be a contract with a price that is left to be agreed upon later. In this case, the plumber\u2019s posting of his hourly rate on his website led the homeowner to believe that the plumber would charge the same amount as the other local plumbers. Thus, the original agreement was a contract with a price to be fixed later. The plumber\u2019s invoice reflected the hourly rate that he actually charged, which was higher than the average of the other local plumbers. The homeowner refused to pay the invoiced amount because she believed that the plumber had misrepresented his hourly rate. The facts indicate that the plumber did not misrepresent his hourly rate, but that the homeowner misperceived it. The homeowner\u2019s misperception of the plumber\u2019s hourly rate, combined with her refusal to pay the contracted price, leads to the conclusion that the plumber is entitled to recover the contracted price less any damages he may have suffered as a result of the homeowner\u2019s breach. Pursuant to UCC \u00a7 2-711(3) and case law, damages for breach of contract are meant to restore the non-breaching party to his/her position prior to the contract. Thus, the plumber is entitled to recover only the difference between what he actually charged and what the average of the other local plumbers charged, plus any incidental damages.

The executive has sent a signed letter to the firm confirming the terms to which the parties have orally agreed while acknowledging that the salary has yet to be set.

The agreement to employ the executive for life is a contract that falls within the statute of frauds, which requires that any such contract be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. The confirmation letter is not signed by the consulting firm and, thus, fails to satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds. B is incorrect. The indefiniteness of the contract relates to its duration (i.e., lifetime employment), not to the time period during which the parties were negotiating. Thus, even if the parties had not reached an agreement on the executive\u2019s salary when they made the oral agreement, the agreement would still be considered indefinite under the statute of frauds. C is incorrect. The statute of frauds does not impose a requirement that the parties negotiate in good faith; rather, it is a requirement that any agreement be in writing and signed. D is correct.

This answer misstates the law with respect to when an implied-in-fact contract may be found.

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA contractor agreed to build a wood-frame house for a landowner for $300,000. The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC.

Although the express terms of a contract may be modified or eliminated by evidence of what the parties intended, any modification of a contract must be made in accordance with applicable statute (UCC \u00a7 2-209) or the contracting parties' agreement (UCC \u00a7 2-207). If the parties did not specifically provide for the modification of the contract in the event of a price-escalation, they are presumed to have intended that the contract be construed according to its terms. However, if the court finds that the parties did not intend to be bound by the express terms of the contract with respect to the particular situation that has arisen, it may modify the contract, but only to the extent necessary to carry out the parties' intentions. Thus, if the court finds that the landowner intended to pay only $300,000 but was confused by the absence of the price-escalation clause, the court will construe the contract to reflect that intent and will award the contractor $300,000, reflecting the current price of lumber."

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3.

Despite the engineer\u2019s best efforts, however, the county did not approve the project. Because of this outcome, the developer refused to pay the engineer for any of the engineer\u2019s services. In a breach of contract action by the engineer against the developer, which party will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The developer, because an express condition to the developer\u2019s performance obligation failed to occur.\nB. The developer, because the engineer breached the contract by failing to obtain the county\u2019s approval of the project.\nC. The engineer, because the developer breached the contract by not paying once the developer\u2019s obligation to pay the engineer became due.\nD.

There is no express condition. Under the rule of constructive conditions of exchange, the performance by one party is an implied condition to performance by the other party. Since the engineer performed all obligations, the developer breached by refusing to perform the developer\u2019s contractual obligation to pay the engineer. Answer B is incorrect. The engineer did not breach the contract, because the engineer had an obligation to \u201cuse best efforts to obtain county approval,\u201d not to obtain county approval. Answer D is incorrect.

Later that day, before the firm told the subcontractor of the award, the subcontractor told the firm that it was withdrawing its bid because it had recently undertaken a new project that would absorb all its capacity for the next 18 months. The firm nevertheless accepted the subcontractor\u2019s bid and demanded that it perform the electrical work on the plant, but the subcontractor refused. The firm had to hire another subcontractor to perform the electrical work, at a cost of $115,000. The firm completed the construction of the plant at a profit. Which of the following statements correctly describes the firm\u2019s legal rights, if any, against the first subcontractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The firm is entitled to recover nominal damages only, because it completed the construction at a profit.\nB. The firm is entitled to recover reliance damages, because it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid when it submitted its own bid to the municipality.\nC.

            "explanation": "B is correct. A bid for a specific contract may not be withdrawn after the time for submitting bids has expired or after the contractor has been awarded the contract. Once a bid is made, the bidder is bound to the terms and conditions of that bid for a reasonable time, if the situation permits. A reasonable time is a time that is reasonable in light of the circumstances of the particular case. The fact that the firm was able to employ another contractor does not, in and of itself, establish that a reasonable time had passed. Whether a reasonable time has passed is a question of fact. Therefore, B is correct. A is incorrect because the firm's construction of the wastewater treatment plant was a profitable undertaking. C is incorrect because the passage of time, in and of itself, will not establish that a reasonable time has passed. Whether a reasonable time has passed is a question of fact.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

            "explanation": "D is correct. A party who accepts a offer made by a other party may either 1) accept it completely (and thus form a contract) or 2) refuse it (and not form a contract). If a party accepts a offer, but does not intend to be bound until a later time, he has not accepted it completely. Instead, he has made an option contract. An option contract is a proposal that will be considered an acceptance of a offer if the other party accepts it before the expiration of the time stated in the proposal. If the other party does not accept the offer prior to the expiration of the time stated in the proposal, then the proposer may either 1) extend the time or 2) revoke the proposal. If the proposer extends the time, then he has made a offer that will be considered an acceptance of a offer if the other party accepts it prior to the expiration of the extended time. If the proposer revokes the proposal, then he has not made a offer, but rather simply made a statement that he was not interested in the other party\u2019s offer. Revocation of an option contract has no effect on a offer; it simply means that the proposer was not interested in the other party\u2019s offer. Revocation of a offer, on the other hand, has the effect of destroying the offer. If the owner had not made a offer to the buyer, but instead had merely made a statement that she was not interested in selling the car, then the buyer could have accepted that statement and a contract would not have been formed. But, because the owner made a offer that was accepted by the buyer, a contract was formed. The owner's promise was consideration for the buyer's promise, and the contract was supported by a adequate consideration exchange. Thus, the owner is entitled to recover the difference between the contract price and the price the owner received from the neighbor. B is incorrect. The owner's failure to respond to the buyer's email constituted a waiver of the owner's claim that the buyer breached the contract. A party's failure to object to a significant change in the terms of a contract may constitute a waiver of any objection to those changed terms. By not objecting to the change in time for delivery, the owner waived her claim that the buyer breached the contract. A is incorrect. Bad faith is not a valid defense to a breach of contract claim. A party's subjective bad faith is not sufficient on its own to avoid the consequences of a breach; there must be an independent violation of the law (e.g., fraud) to support a claim of bad faith.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3.

In return for his daughter\u2019s promise to pay $300,000 to his nephew at the time of the father\u2019s death, the father executed and delivered to his daughter a quitclaim deed to the land. The daughter took possession of the land. Two years later, in a signed writing, the father directed his daughter to pay to a neighbor, at the father\u2019s death, $50,000 of the $300,000 that was to go to the nephew. The daughter, who had long disliked the neighbor, told her father that she did not plan to honor his request. The father died, and his daughter has since refused to pay anything to either the nephew or the neighbor. The neighbor has sued the daughter for the $50,000. Is the neighbor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter did not consent to any modification of the contract she had made with her father.\nB. No, because the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, and the nephew\u2019s interest could not be modified without his express written consent.\nC. Yes, because the father retained a transferable interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Although a promise not to pay a debt after the death of the promisor (a promise to contractually waive the applicable statute of limitations) is generally unenforceable by the beneficiary of the promise (Bowen v. Foulk, 157 N.C. 548, 72 S.E. 525 (1911)), a promise to contractually waive the statute of limitations is an exception to this general rule. A promise to waive the statute of limitations after the death of the promisor is enforceable by the beneficiary of the promise if the promise was made prior to the time the statute of limitations ran. Thus, if the promise was made prior to the time the applicable statute of limitations ran (in this case, two years), then a promise to waive the statute of limitations after the death of the promisor is enforceable by the beneficiary of the promise. In this case, the promise was made prior to the time the statute of limitations ran, and the neighbor is entitled to enforce the promise. The facts are in accord with the facts in Mills v. Mills, 318 N.C. 74, 347 S.E.2d 242 (1986)."

The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

The issue is not whether the boy was a good or bad trespasser, but whether he had the mental capacity of a 10- or 11-year-old child. C is correct.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere.

The man will not be able to recover any damages from the owner or the manufacturer because they are not liable for the man's injuries. The owner and the manufacturer are each responsible for 25% of the man's injuries. The man's recovery from the customer will be reduced by the percentage of fault attributable to the man, which is 25%. Therefore, the man will be able to recover 25% of his damages from the customer and nothing from the owner or the manufacturer. C is incorrect. The man will be able to recover 25% of his damages from each defendant. A and B are correct."

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA doctor ordered chest X-rays for a patient who smoked cigarettes. After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC. Yes, because punitive damages awards are not authorized unless there is proof of willful or wanton misconduct on the defendant\u2019s part.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. Punitive damages are meant to punish a defendant for conduct that is so egregious that it shows malice, ill will, or gross negligence. In this case, the radiologist's failure to properly interpret the patient's X-rays was so egregious that it should be deemed to show malice, ill will, or gross negligence. A is incorrect because the fact, if it is one, that the jury awarded $3 million in compensatory damages is irrelevant to the issue of whether the punitive damages award should be vacated. A jury's award of substantial compensatory damages will not, on its own, justify an award of punitive damages. C is incorrect because it is possible to find that a defendant was negligent, but not that the defendant had malice, ill will, or gross negligence. A jury could, for example, find that the radiologist had acted with negligence in failing to properly interpret the X-rays, but that he had not done anything with malice, ill will, or gross negligence. The plaintiff would then not be entitled to punitive damages. D is incorrect because the fact, if it is one, that the patient smoked cigarettes is irrelevant to the issue of whether the punitive damages award should be vacated. The fact that the patient smoked cigarettes is relevant only to the issue of whether the jury's award of compensatory damages was appropriate. It is not unconstitutionally punitive damages."

An employee of the agency went to the buyer\u2019s home and knocked on the front door. When the buyer answered, the employee explained that he was there to repossess the car and asked for the car keys. The buyer handed the employee the keys but then asked the employee to allow her to retrieve her laptop computer from the car. The employee declined the request, explaining to the buyer that any possessions in the car could be reclaimed from the company after the car was repossessed. After pleading unsuccessfully with the employee, the buyer shoved the employee away from the door with such force that the employee fell and suffered a broken wrist. The buyer then ran to the car, which was unlocked, and retrieved the laptop. The employee has sued the buyer for battery. The buyer has moved for summary judgment, arguing that she was privileged to act as she did. Should the trial court grant the buyer\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a fact-finder could reasonably conclude that the buyer used excessive force in attempting to defend her property.\nB. No, because after the buyer handed the keys to the employee, the car was no longer her property.\nC. Yes, because a possessor can use nonlethal force to protect his or her property.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The buyer intentionally shoved the employee, which satisfies the prima facie case for battery. As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

            "explanation": "A is correct. The fact, if it is one, that the elevator was negligently maintained or installed is relevant on the issue of proximate cause, but it is not a sufficient reason for finding the defendant negligent. If the jury finds that the defendant was not negligent, then any act or omission of the passenger, no matter how outrageous, could not have been the cause of the passenger's injury. B is incorrect. The fact that the jury could find that the passenger's act contributed to his injury is not a sufficient reason to deny the passenger's request for the res ipsa loquitur instruction. A finding that the passenger's act contributed to his injury, while possible, is certainly not a finding that the defendant was not negligent. C is incorrect. In cases where the jury is permitted to infer negligence from the proximate cause of the injury, the court will usually instruct the jury to consider any act or omission of the plaintiff that might have contributed to his or her injury. This instruction, however, is not required in cases involving res ipsa loquitur. Thus, D is correct. The jury should be instructed that the defendant is presumptively negligent and that the plaintiff does not need to prove that the defendant was negligent.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3.

The debt collector was trying to collect a large debt owed to his client by the woman\u2019s impoverished adult son. Although the debt collector knew that the woman was not legally responsible for the son\u2019s debt, he called the woman multiple times each day and threatened to destroy her credit. He also told her that he knew where she lived and that he was going to withdraw the money from her bank account. As a result, the woman suffered great mental anguish, was unable to sleep, and ultimately suffered serious health consequences. Which of the following conclusions would best support a claim by the woman against the debt collector for intentional infliction of emotional distress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The debt collector could reasonably have foreseen that the calls and threats might cause harm to the woman\u2019s health.\nB. The debt collector\u2019s conduct caused the woman to fear that he was someday going to physically attack her.\nC. The debt collector\u2019s conduct failed to comply with industry custom.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. A claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires that the defendant have acted with malice toward the plaintiff, and that the defendant have intentionally caused severe emotional distress to the plaintiff. Malice is not a state of mind, but rather it is an intent to cause injury or suffering to the plaintiff. It is difficult to prove malice, and there is a significant burden shifting at trial from the plaintiff to the defendant. However, the defendant's malice can be shown by having acted with indifference to the consequences of his actions. In this case, the debt collector should win because he should be found to have had the malice necessary for a claim of IIED."

A conclusion that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous, combined with the fact that the woman experienced severe emotional distress and the fact that the debt collector was probably at least reckless with respect to the risk of causing her distress, will provide the woman with a plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman\u2019s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.   Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. Answer C is incorrect. A mere failure to comply with industry custom does not establish any of the elements of IIED.",

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nThe owner of a home in a rural area had for many years enjoyed unspoiled views of the surrounding countryside from her back deck. Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC. It is not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in places that are visible to neighbors.\nD.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Private nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with another's use or enjoyment of property. The fact that the farmer's items may cause offense or annoyance to the homeowner is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a nuisance. Whether an action for nuisance will be successful turns on whether the defendant's actions have caused a substantial, unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's use or enjoyment of her property. The best argument that the farmer can raise is that the homeowner has failed to prove that the farmer's actions have caused a substantial interference with the homeowner's use and enjoyment of her property. Thus, Answer C is correct, and Answers A, B and D are incorrect."

            "question_number": 99,
            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

Both the contractor and the homeowner, because neither posted a warning that the porch boards had been loosened.\nB. Neither the homeowner nor the contractor, because the friend was a licensee.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Under these facts, the contractor is an independent contractor and should be held strictly liable for the full extent of the damages arising from the negligent performance of the work. Although the homeowner is not a party to the lawsuit, she will be entitled to recover damages from the contractor to the extent that those damages exceed the contractor's liability to the friend. Thus, the contractor's liability to the friend is limited to $250,000, and the homeowner can recover $500,000. Because the contractor is strictly liable for the full extent of the damages, there is no distinction between active and passive negligence. Therefore, the contractor's negligence in loosening the porch boards in a deceptive manner, without posting a warning, will be sufficient to sustain the jury's finding of negligence."

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph \u201cis what the proponent claims it is.\u201d The witness\u2019s proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw it.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying. Here, the defendant\u2019s purpose for his wrongful conduct (killing the declarant) was revenge for a theft and not a desire to prevent trial testimony. Therefore, the prosecutor cannot make the showing of intent required for forfeiture of either objection. Answers A and B are incorrect for the reasons set out above.   Answer D is incorrect.

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant has been charged with selling cocaine. On the night of the alleged sale, a police officer arrested a woman and found a large package of cocaine in her car. The woman was brought to the police station for questioning. During her interrogation, she admitted to a police officer that she had sold cocaine and said that she had obtained the cocaine from the defendant, who was a local supplier. By the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, the woman has left the country. The prosecutor calls the police officer to testify that the woman told him that the defendant was her cocaine supplier. The defendant\u2019s attorney objects. Is the woman\u2019s statement to the police officer admissible to prove that the defendant sold cocaine?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the prosecutor has not shown that the woman\u2019s attendance at trial could not have been procured through process or other reasonable means.\nC. Yes, as the statement of the defendant\u2019s coconspirator.\nD. Yes, as the woman\u2019s declaration against penal interest.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "C is correct. The woman\u2019s statement that the defendant was her supplier is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. However, the statement is admissible as a declaration against penal interest. A declaration against penal interest is an out-of-court statement that is given by a person with knowledge of the facts and is made under belief that the statement might later be used in a criminal trial against the speaker. The statement must be made before a grand jury, judge, magistrate or other detached neutral authority and must be admissible to support the prosecution's case. The woman's statement that she received the cocaine from the defendant is a declaration against penal interest. The statement is admissible to support the prosecutor's case that the defendant sold cocaine."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The woman\u2019s statement is hearsay if offered to prove its truth\u2014that the defendant sold cocaine. There is no hearsay exception that would apply to admit her statement against the defendant. Answer B is incorrect. The prosecutor\u2019s failure to establish the woman\u2019s unavailability is not the reason that her statement is inadmissible. Because there is no hearsay exception that would make the woman\u2019s statement admissible to prove its truth, it would be inadmissible even if the prosecutor were to properly establish her unavailability. Answer C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement was made to a police officer following her arrest and not during a drug conspiracy with the defendant. The statement also certainly did nothing to further a drug conspiracy, even if one did exist. Answer D is incorrect. The portion of the woman\u2019s statement attributing fault to the defendant and suggesting that he was her drug supplier was not against the woman\u2019s penal interest. Indeed, once she was apprehended, her statement   shifted blame to the defendant and away from herself and was in fact self-serving.",

The production of evidence \u201csufficient to support a finding\u201d that the evidence is what the proponent (here the prosecution) claims it to be is the proper standard for authentication under FRE 901.

A finding by the court that the prosecution has made a clear and convincing showing that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be is not required.

Proof of chain of custody\u2014what happened to the evidence after it was initially seized from the apartment\u2014is one way of authenticating evidence, but it is not necessary here, since the prosecution has called a witness who will testify that he saw each of the items in the apartment.

But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect.

The grantor's future interest is a cloud on the friend's fee simple determinable estate and, if exercised, will terminate the friend's estate. In this case, the grantor's future interest is a reasonable one and, therefore, the termination will not violate the Rule Against Perpetuities. The termination of the friend's estate occurs automatically when the limitation is exercised and the friend cannot claim any sort of right of first refusal to prevent the termination. A is incorrect because the grantor's future interest is a cloud on the friend's fee simple determinable estate and, if exercised, will terminate the friend's estate.

            "explanation": "C is correct. A future interest is a right to possess, use, or enjoy property at some time in the future or upon the occurrence of a certain event. A future interest is usually created by a will or by operation of law where a grantor has reserved the future ownership of property. A future interest may be conveyed or transferred by deed, but possession does not pass immediately. Instead, the grantor retains possession and the right to use the property while the future interest is retained by the grantee. A future interest is void if the grantor who created it dies before the time the interest is to vest or before the happening of the contingency which is to bring it into existence. In this case, the woman executed and delivered to her nephew a warranty deed purporting to convey her home to him if he were to marry. The deed was recorded before the woman died and the nephew retained possession and the right to enter and enjoy the premises. The nephew\u2019s future interest became vested when the woman died. Because the nephew did not marry before the woman\u2019s death, he has no interest in the home and the executor is correct that the nephew has no interest in the home. A is incorrect. A recorded deed will normally be given effect by the applicable statute of frauds if the time period for possession has not expired. However, this is not the case where the deed is to a future interest. The applicable statute of frauds for a deed to a future interest is the statute which provides for the duration of the interest. In this case, the deed created a future interest which was to vest if the nephew married. The nephew\u2019s future interest became vested when the woman died. B is incorrect. A grantor may reserve a future interest in property by expressing in the deed that the interest is retained or by implication. Where a grantor has retained a future interest, the interest is vested immediately upon the execution of the deed and possession is retained by the grantor. The grantor has the right to reenter and possess the property, as well as the right to dispose of the property. The nephew retained possession and the right to enter and enjoy the premises. The nephew\u2019s future interest became vested when the woman died. D is incorrect. The woman could have executed and delivered a deed to her nephew purposely to prevent him from marrying. However, that was not the case. The deed was recorded promptly after the woman executed and delivered it to her nephew and the nephew retained possession. The nephew\u2019s future interest became vested when the woman died."

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

Her friend agreed to loan her the entire purchase price if, immediately following the purchase, the woman would deed the land to him. They also agreed that the woman would have 10 years in which to repay the loan and that the friend would deed the land back to the woman when the loan was fully repaid. Lastly, they agreed that during the 10-year period the woman could live on the land. The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her. The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB. No, because the contract between the woman and her friend merged into the deed.\nC. Yes, because the parties agreed that the woman could live on the land.\nD.

            "explanation": "C is correct. A mortgagee has the option of either foreclosing or accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. A deed in lieu of foreclosure is a conveyance of land from a mortgagor to a mortgagee in satisfaction of a mortgage debt and in order to avoid the expense and \"publicity\" of foreclosure. A mortgagor may offer to execute and deliver such a deed to a mortgagee if the mortgagor is in financial difficulty and the mortgagee is willing to accept the deed and to relieve the mortgagor of any further obligation on the mortgage. A deed in lieu of foreclosure is a good substitute for a foreclosure where the mortgagor is under severe financial duress and wants to avoid the \"stigma\" of a foreclosure on her credit report. The mortgagee is not required to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The mortgagor has no right to require the mortgagee to accept the deed. The decision whether to accept the deed is entirely within the discretion of the mortgagee. A mortgagee is more likely to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure if the mortgagor is current on her mortgage payments but is suffering from a temporary financial setback, such as loss of a job, or if the mortgaged property is worth significantly less than the amount of the mortgage. A mortgagee may also accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure to reduce the amount of money it will expend to foreclose. A deed in lieu of foreclosure is a voluntary conveyance by the mortgagor to the mortgagee and, therefore, does not require the approval of the court or any other governmental authority. The mortgagee, at its discretion, may either refuse the offer or accept the deed and take possession of the mortgaged property. If the mortgagee accepts the deed and takes possession, it will then bring an appropriate action to foreclose the mortgage if necessary to protect its security interest."

Further, the time for closing was extended by both parties (the seller\u2019s lawyer) and the buyer\u2019s failure to close was caused by his hospitalization and not by any mental or physical condition prior to the accident.

The fact that the land was originally conveyed to the city for park purposes, combined with the 10-year statute of limitations for title by adverse possession, means that time is of the essence in this case. B is incorrect. The court would likely not reach this conclusion because title by adverse possession requires the use of the land in a manner that is open and notorious, and for a substantial length of time. C is incorrect. The woman's son has no interest that would terminate simply because the woman died. A title acquired by adverse possession will be defeated by the owner's heir if the heir asserts their claim within 21 years of the time the adverse use began. D is incorrect.

A mortgage is usually given in conjunction with a signed note and is thus a security interest that is subject to the Statute of Frauds. The bank's mortgage on the commercial building is a mortgage within the statute, and therefore the Statute of Frauds applies to that mortgage as well. Pursuant to the statute, any mortgage on property owned by one person and given to secure a debt of another must be in writing and signed by both the grantor and the grantee. Here, the mortgage on the motel is also a mortgage within the statute. Both mortgages were promptly recorded, and nothing in the facts indicates that the bank's interest in the motel was not created until the time of the loan transaction. Accordingly, the Statute of Frauds applies to the bank's mortgage on the motel, and the bank cannot foreclose on the motel without producing a properly authenticated written and signed note and mortgage. B is incorrect. This answer correctly determines that the bank cannot foreclose on the motel, but it is incorrect in its determination that the mother is personally liable on the debt. The bank's mortgage on the motel is a mortgage within the statute, and the Statute of Frauds requires that the mother be joined as a party to the transaction. However, the bank's mortgage on the motel does not relieve the man of his personal liability on the debt. C is incorrect. The fact that the mother did not sign a promissory note is irrelevant to whether the bank can foreclose on the motel. D is incorrect. This answer correctly determines that the bank cannot foreclose on the motel, but it is incorrect in its determination that the bank does not hold an enforceable mortgage on the motel. The bank's mortgage on the motel is a mortgage within the statute, and the Statute of Frauds requires that the mother be joined as a party to the transaction.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n\n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation:  The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

A woman owned land across the street that did not have direct ocean access. For $10,000, the man executed a deed titled \u201cGrant of Pedestrian Right-of-Way\u201d to the woman and \u201cher heirs and assigns\u201d over a designated strip of his land between the street and the ocean. The deed was never recorded. Several years later, the woman sold her land. The woman made no mention of the easement, and the buyer had no actual notice of it. After the buyer took possession of the land, neighbors informed her about the pedestrian easement over the man\u2019s land, but when the buyer attempted to use the easement, the man informed her that it was no longer available and constructed a chain-link fence to block the way. The buyer promptly sued the man to establish her right to use the easement. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The buyer, because the easement was appurtenant to her land.\nB. The buyer, because the man received $10,000.\nC. The man, because the buyer purchased the land without notice.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is correct. This is a common situation in the law of easements. A grantor may convey a fee simple title to land but reserve an easement for themselves or a third party. The easement remains with the land and runs with it from owner to owner. In this case, the grantor retained the easement for himself, but it is still an easement in gross and runs with the land. The buyer is entitled to the use of the easement because it is appurtenant to her land. B is incorrect. $10,000 is not a large enough consideration to support a fee simple title. Title to the land would be vested in the buyer fee simple determinable, and the easement would be a title impediment that would terminate automatically if the man did not use the easement. C is incorrect. Notice to the buyer would have been adequate. The man's failure to record the deed or to object to the buyer's title would have given the buyer constructive notice of the easement. D is incorrect. The easement was created for the benefit of the neighbor, not the grantor. It is an easement in gross."

The man granted an express easement appurtenant to the woman \u201cand her heirs and assigns.\u201d The man\u2019s land was the servient estate, the woman\u2019s land was the dominant estate, and the easement benefits the woman\u2019s land. An easement appurtenant passes with the title, and now the buyer has the benefit of the easement. It is irrelevant that the buyer had no actual notice of the easement when she bought the land. Answer B is incorrect. The fact that the man received $10,000 is irrelevant. The man granted the woman an easement appurtenant, which runs with the dominant estate. An easement appurtenant may be granted by purchase or by gift. Answer C is incorrect. The buyer did purchase the land without any type of notice, but this is not a reason for the man to prevail. The easement is for the benefit of whoever owns the land. The buyer can still assert her right to the easement appurtenant because the easement has not terminated.   Answer D is incorrect. The easement was granted to the woman as the owner of the land across the street, which is the dominant estate. The easement was not granted to the woman in her personal capacity. It was an easement appurtenant and not in gross.",

The nephew then demanded immediate payment from the niece for half of the mortgage payments he had made. The niece refused. If the nephew sues the niece for contribution, who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of exoneration.\nB.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Where joint owners own property in common, one joint owner can mortgage or convey their interest without the consent of the other joint owner. However, if one joint owner makes an expenditure in which the other joint owner has a proprietary interest, then the joint owner making the expenditure has a right to reimbursement. This right of reimbursement arises only after the expenditure has been made, and it exists only between the joint owners. It is not a right against the world at large. If the nephew paid the mortgage obligation, then he has a right to reimbursement from the niece. This is not a right of exoneration; it is a right of reimbursement. A is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration applies where one owner improperly pays the debts of the others or where one owner improperly makes an expenditure on the property. Neither situation exists here. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the nephew is entitled to reimbursement from the niece, but it overstates the amount of time during which the nephew made the payments. The bank's mortgage was for 10 years, and the nephew's obligation to make the payments ended after 10 years as well. D is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the nephew is entitled to reimbursement from the niece, but it overstates the amount of time during which the nephew made the payments.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The nephew and the niece inherited the vacant land as tenants in common. While neither is personally liable on the mortgage, their failure to pay could result in a foreclosure. To avoid foreclosure, payment must be made to the bank, and as co-tenants, each is responsible for his or her share of the mortgage payment. The nephew paid more than his pro rata share and thus may recover the amount owed by the niece in a contribution action. Answer A is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration applies when land that is subject to a mortgage is acquired at the time of death and an attempt is made by the specific legatee to claim that the mortgage must be paid from general estate assets, a scenario that does not exist here. Answer C is incorrect. A partition action is not required before bringing an action for contribution for making mortgage payments that, if not made, might have resulted in the foreclosure on the property by the bank. Answer D is incorrect. Each tenant in common is required to make his or her pro rata share of payments such as mortgage payments, which if not paid could result in foreclosure on the property.

The mortgage will continue to be a lien on the property, and the assignee will be entitled to enforce the mortgage, including foreclosing, if necessary. B is incorrect.

Can the supplier be convicted of murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the shooting and the disposal of the body were separate events that cannot be viewed as a single scheme or plan.\nB. No, because the supplier did not intend that the fall from the cliff would kill the lookout.\nC. Yes, because both the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of the original plan to kill the lookout.\nD.

Thus, at most, the supplier could be convicted of attempted murder, and the dealer could not be convicted of murder or attempted murder. Because the dealer did not intend to kill the lookout and the supplier did not intend that the dealer would kill the lookout, the best answer is D. The dealer could be convicted of murder or attempted murder only if he intended to kill the lookout. He did not intend to kill the lookout.

The best evidence of a person's intent is what he or she has said. Thus, the woman's statement that she did not want to take possession of the bag is the best evidence of her intent. It is also clear that the agents did not entrap the woman. Entrapment occurs when law enforcement officers persuade a person to commit a crime that the person would not otherwise have committed.

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement.

Larceny is a specific intent crime, whereas embezzlement is a non-specific intent crime. Larceny requires that the defendant have the intent to steal, whereas embezzlement requires that the defendant merely have the intent to convert the property.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself.

Chosen Option Label: B\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant was charged in federal court under the Assimilative Crimes Act, which provides that the criminal law of the state in question applies to crimes committed on federal enclaves within the state. Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The man did nothing but offer to pay, and this conduct is not \u201cdangerously proximate\u201d to the commission of the offense as required by the common law. Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony. Additionally, the facts do not establish a misprision. That offense   occurs when a person fails to inform the authorities about a felony that the person knows about.",

However, the Supreme Court has recognized an exception to the warrant requirement where police are responding to an emergency. This exception exists because the time necessary to obtain a warrant could mean the loss of life or serious physical injury. The police, in this case, were responding to phone calls from concerned neighbors that a man was breaking windows and cutting himself. That is sufficient evidence to support that the police reasonably believed that a person was in imminent danger and that the time it would take to obtain a warrant could have resulted in death or serious physical injury. B is incorrect. The police do not need to believe that a crime is taking place in order to use the emergency aid exception. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the police can use the exception where they reasonably believe that a person is in imminent danger.

Strickland does not, however, list a defendant\u2019s decision to pursue a certain defense strategy as a factor that would render counsel\u2019s performance deficient. Counsel\u2019s decision to not investigate a defendant\u2019s background is an important part of the defendant\u2019s decision about how to plead guilty or go to trial. It is irrelevant to the jury\u2019s determination of what sentence should be imposed. B is incorrect. The facts supporting answer B are taken from Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364 (1993), which is the leading case on the standards for reviewing a sentence imposed in a capital case. The standard for reviewing a sentence in a capital case is not whether counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable, but whether the jury\u2019s determination of the sentence was reasonable. The fact that counsel\u2019s performance may have been reasonable does not mean that the jury\u2019s determination of the sentence was reasonable. C is correct. The facts supporting answer C are taken from Williams v. Runnels, 565 U.S. 504 (2012).

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
