            "explanation": "C is correct. For a suit to be properly brought in federal court, a party must have diversity of citizenship with the opposing party. This means that no plaintiff can sue a defendant where all the parties are citizens of the same state. To determine whether there is diversity, a court will look at the place where a party resides for the purposes of that party's \"general personal affairs.\" This is different from the party's \"legal residence\" for purposes of voting, for which the court will look to the place where one actually lives. For a corporation, the place to look for diversity is the place where the corporation is incorporated. If there is diversity, the case will be removed to federal court from state court if it originally was filed there. If there is no diversity, the case will stay in state court. B is incorrect because the minimum contacts analysis is for when a non-resident defendant is sued in a state where he has no contacts. The shareholder will likely allege that the company breached its duty to disclose important information about the company to shareholders, and that the breach caused shareholder loss. This is an issue of federal civil procedure, not constitutional law. A is incorrect because the distribution of a company's products is irrelevant for purposes of diversity. D is incorrect because the location of a company's headquarters is also irrelevant for purposes of diversity."

            "question_number": 1,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Here, the case was removed from the state court in State B to the federal court in State B, which is within the jurisdiction of the federal court that originally heard the case.

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants. Answer D is incorrect. Personal service under Rule 4 can occur at any location, not just the person\u2019s home.

Federal Rule 5(b)(2) provides that a party may serve an individual, partnership, or corporation with a complaint or an answer by mailing a copy of the complaint or answer to him or her at his or her dwelling or place of business. The party may also mail a copy to a dwelling or place of business that the person has previously designated in writing.

The 20-day period runs from the mailing of the complaint or answer. If the complaint is not returned within 30 days after service, the complaint is considered filed and served on the 31st day. C is incorrect because the defendant had 20 days from the date of service to return the waiver request. The plaintiff filed and served the complaint on the defendant 61 days after commencement of the action; thus, the defendant had 20 days from the date of service to return the waiver.

Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.",

            "explanation": "A is correct. The plain error standard is difficult to meet because it has three requirements: (i) the error must be plain, i.e., so obvious and clear as to be cited as an error; (ii) the error must affect substantial rights; and (iii) the error must result in an unfair advantage to the appellant. This standard is only applicable in very limited circumstances, such as in instances where the court has misstated the law or has failed to charge the jury on a mandatory matter. B is incorrect because a motion for a new trial must be made immediately after the jury has retired to consider its verdict. A motion for judgment as a matter of law cannot be used to raise error in jury instructions. C is incorrect because the court has broad discretion in the charge of the jury, and will only be reversed for abuse of discretion when the record shows that the court's instructions were misleading or confusing. D is incorrect because the defendant is responsible for objecting to instructional errors that occur during trial. Failure to do so will result in waiver."

Because the defendant did not object to any of the instructions, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51(d)(2) provides that the defendant\u2019s appeal can only be successful if the instruction affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, which is the standard for plain error. Answer B is incorrect. There is no obligation to seek a new trial before challenging jury instructions on appeal, so long as the applicable plain error standard can be satisfied. Plain error is the standard because the defendant failed to object at trial. Answer C is incorrect. Plain error, not abuse of discretion, is the standard for reviewing instructions that the parties did not object to, as was the case here. Answer D is incorrect. The errors were not waived by the failure to object. Rather, the failure to object waived full review, with the result that the standard for assigning error was raised to plain error.",

In its answer, the manufacturer included the affirmative defense of contributory negligence. Applicable state law had recently abolished contributory negligence as a defense in such actions. Before trial, the judge allowed the parties to submit proposed jury instructions. The manufacturer\u2019s attorney proposed an instruction that the jury should not return a verdict for the consumer if it found that the consumer had been contributorily negligent.

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer D is incorrect.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect.

However, the woman\u2019s goal is to dismiss and refile the action. Submitting the described affidavit would not achieve that goal.",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

The governor, as head of the state, would certainly have standing to challenge his detention on constitutional grounds. The director of the federal detention facility would be the proper respondent.

B is incorrect. The company's suit is not moot just because the bridge is complete; the company is seeking a declaratory judgment that the federal government violated the law by not awarding the contract to the company, and this declaratory judgment would have substantial value to the company even if the construction of the bridge is completed.

This is known as the federal government's enumerated powers. Any action taken by Congress that does not fall within an enumerated power is considered to be beyond the scope of federal power and thus may be struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. In this case, Congress has enacted a statute making the possession of a certain type of tea a misdemeanor. Whether or not that statute falls within Congress's power is a two-prong test. The first prong is to ask whether the activity is commercial or non-commercial. If it is commercial, Congress has the power to regulate it under the commerce clause. If it is non-commercial, Congress does not have that power and the statute will be struck down as unconstitutional. The second prong is to ask whether the item has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. If it does not, then Congress also lacks the power to regulate it and the statute will be struck down. In this case, the tea is not a commercial item, and the activity of boiling the water is a non-commercial one.

This is known as the federal enclave exception to the taxation of the federal government. The taxation of the federal government is within the power of the states because the federal government is a creature of the states and its power is limited by the Constitution. Therefore, the state may tax the federal government and its property within the state when the state does not impair federal supremacy. This is an area where the federal government shares sovereignty with the state. For that reason, the state must respect and not impair federal supremacy. If the state does impair federal supremacy, the federal government can sue the state in federal court for an injunction to stop the violation of federal law. The federal government will usually prevail because the state is the party that must respect federal law, not the other way around. Therefore, D is incorrect. B is incorrect because payment of the tax may have unduly burdened the contractor's ability to complete the work in a timely manner. For example, if the tax were high or if the timing of the payments caused cash flow problems for the contractor, payment of the tax may have unduly burdened the contractor's performance of the work. A is incorrect because the tax was not paid directly from federal funds. The contractor paid the tax from a separate account funded by the federal government. Therefore, the tax was not an undue burden on a federal function."

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect.

If a state law is potentially applicable to the federal government, the state law will be construed by the federal courts to determine whether or not it impedes federal supremacy. In doing so, the federal court will consider the following factors:\n   1. The nature of the federal government's involvement;\n   2. The nature of the state law;\n   3. The history of the relationship between the federal and state government; and\n   4. The effect that the state law has on the federal government's ability to perform its constitutional duties.\nIf the state law applies to the federal government, the court will examine the constitutionality of the state law, taking into account the following standards:\n   1. The federal government has plenary power to control the territory and property within a state when it is doing so as a means to carry out a federal governmental function; and\n   2. A state may not impede the federal government's ability to control the territory and property within a state when the federal government is doing so as a means to carry out a federal governmental function.\nIn this case, the state law imposes a tax on all leases of real estate. The tax is calculated on gross rent and is imposed on the lessee at the beginning of each lease term. Because the United States Social Security Administration is leasing office space in the state, the state may consider the United States to be the lessee of the office building and therefore subject the United States to the tax.

This question requires you to distinguish between the rules for negotiating the price of a contractual services agreement (which is an agreement to provide a specified quantity of services) and the rules for negotiating the price of a pure labor agreement (which is an agreement to provide services until some specified condition is met). The key distinction is that, in a contractual services agreement, the parties must agree on the price for the entire quantity of services to be provided. In a pure labor agreement, however, the parties only need to agree on the price for the time necessary to satisfy the specified condition. In this case, the facts indicate that the homeowner and the plumber entered into a contractual services agreement. This is because the homeowner asked the plumber to unclog her basement drain, which would require the plumber to provide a specified quantity of services \u2013 the unclogging of the drain.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Pursuant to UCC \u00a7 2-206(1), a party's acceptance of a job offer where the terms are not fully expressed in the offer is considered an acceptance that is subject to the terms of the offer. In this case, the executive's acceptance of the offer by sending the letter was an acceptance that was subject to the terms of the offer. Pursuant to UCC \u00a7 2-206(3), a party may not renege on an acceptance merely by making a lower offer. Thus, the consulting firm must accept the executive's employment at the salary the executive has put forward, unless the executive's proposal is unreasonable. Thus, the parties have a binding contract, as evidenced by the consulting firm's failure to respond to the executive's letter. C is incorrect because the agreement is not subject to the statute of frauds. A is incorrect because the confirmation letter does not satisfy the statute of frauds, as the letter is not a signed writing. B is incorrect because the agreement is not too indefinite to be enforced; the terms of the agreement are clearly expressed in the oral agreement and the executive's letter."

Answer A is incorrect. A \u201clifetime\u201d employment agreement is not subject to the statute of frauds, because it could be performed within a year if the employee dies within that time period. Answer C is incorrect. While it is true that a \u201clifetime\u201d employment agreement is not subject to the statute of frauds, when the parties fail to expressly agree to an essential term in a contract, there is no requirement that they negotiate for agreement on that term in good faith. Answer D is incorrect. A \u201clifetime\u201d employment agreement does not fall within the statute of frauds, so the confirmation letter is not necessary to enforce any contract formed.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC.

Therefore, a court will consider the facts of the case and reform the writing to reflect the parties\u2019 intent.

Pursuant to UCC 2-711(3) and 2-706(3), a party whose bid or proposal is accepted may retract the bid or proposal if done prior to acceptance or within a reasonable time after acceptance.

Thus, the subcontractor's bid was still open for acceptance within the meaning of UCC 2-711(3) for a reasonable time after the firm accepted it.

Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

Although the lender did not verify any of the information contained in the man's application before funding the loan, the lender's verbal questioning of the man and the man's response to that questioning constituted an assent by the man to the lender's additional condition precedent to funding the loan: the man must disclose to the lender all facts that would cause the man\u2019s original statement of his financial condition to be a misrepresentation. Because the man failed to do so and the lender learned of the man\u2019s true financial condition before disbursement of the funds, the lender was entitled to cancel disbursement of the funds and rescind the loan agreement. C is incorrect because concealment is not a necessary condition for the lender to exercise this option. A is incorrect because the lender's failure to verify the information in the man's application before funding the loan is not a sufficient condition for the lender to cancel disbursement of the funds and rescind the loan agreement. B is incorrect because the man did not affirmatively misrepresent his financial condition at any time. However, the man did not disclose to the lender all facts that would cause the man\u2019s original statement of his financial condition to be a misrepresentation, which was a condition precedent to funding the loan that the man assented to when he answered the lender\u2019s question about his changed financial condition."

Two years later, in a signed writing, the father directed his daughter to pay to a neighbor, at the father\u2019s death, $50,000 of the $300,000 that was to go to the nephew.

An assignment of a contract is the delegation by a party of a right or duty under a contract to another party. By contrast, a modification of a contract is a change in the terms of the contract made by the agreement of the parties to the contract. In this case, the facts indicate that the father devised a way to ensure that his favorite relative would receive a gift upon his death by executing a quitclaim deed to his daughter and directing her to make a payment to his nephew after his death. Because the father's intent was to have his favorite relative receive a gift upon his death, his quitclaim deed to his daughter should be considered an assignment of a future interest rather than a modification of his will. The daughter's subsequent failure to honor her father's directive to make the neighbor a payment after his death would constitute a breach of the assignment."

After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC.

An employee of the agency went to the buyer\u2019s home and knocked on the front door. When the buyer answered, the employee explained that he was there to repossess the car and asked for the car keys. The buyer handed the employee the keys but then asked the employee to allow her to retrieve her laptop computer from the car. The employee declined the request, explaining to the buyer that any possessions in the car could be reclaimed from the company after the car was repossessed. After pleading unsuccessfully with the employee, the buyer shoved the employee away from the door with such force that the employee fell and suffered a broken wrist. The buyer then ran to the car, which was unlocked, and retrieved the laptop. The employee has sued the buyer for battery. The buyer has moved for summary judgment, arguing that she was privileged to act as she did. Should the trial court grant the buyer\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

In cases involving assumption of risk, the plaintiff can still prevail by showing the defendant breached the duty to use reasonable care, that the defendant's breach caused the damages complained of, and that the plaintiff assumed the risk knowingly and voluntarily. If the plaintiff can show that the defendant breached a duty to use reasonable care and that the defendant's breach caused the damages, and the plaintiff also assumed the risk knowingly and voluntarily, the plaintiff will prevail despite the defense of assumption of risk. B is incorrect because if the plaintiff can show that the defendant breached a duty to use reasonable care and that the defendant's breach caused the damages, and the plaintiff also assumed the risk knowingly and voluntarily, the plaintiff will prevail despite the defense of assumption of risk. C is incorrect because the man was a licensee for part of his stay at the beach house, and a landowner owes a licensee a limited duty to conduct inspections for hidden defects in the premises. The man, however, became a trespasser when he entered the unfinished basement without the owner's knowledge. A trespasser has no duty to use care for his own safety.

D is incorrect because with regard to punitive damages, the plaintiff must show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's acts were intentional or reckless, and the jury verdict must be unanimous.

Although the facts indicate that the homeowner was disturbed by the farmer's actions, the facts do not indicate that the farmer's actions caused a substantial, unreasonable interference with the homeowner's use or enjoyment of her property. Therefore, D is the farmer's best argument against liability. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because they are not relevant to the determination of whether the farmer will be held liable for private nuisance."

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

An admissible opinion about the cause of the price drop cannot be based on the stockholder\u2019s perception; it requires an expertise that he does not possess. His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue. Answer D is incorrect.

There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth.

            "explanation": "A grantor can convey future interests in land, as well as present interests. Where a grantor conveys future interests subject to a restriction, the grantee has the right to possession of the land subject to the restriction and the grantor retains the power to revoke the interest if the grantee violates the restriction. If the grantor chooses to exercise this power, the grantor must provide the grantee with reasonable notice of the termination of the interest and an opportunity to cure the violation. If the grantor fails to provide such notice and an opportunity to cure, the interest will not terminate automatically but will be subject to the statute of frauds. In this case, the facts indicate that the grantor gave the friend both possession of the property and the right to remain in possession so long as he did not sell alcohol on the property. Four years later, the friend violated the restriction by opening a tavern and selling alcohol on the property. The grantor had not given the friend advance notice of the restriction or an opportunity to cure the violation; thus, the interest will not terminate automatically but will be subject to the statute of frauds. Because the facts indicate that the friend was in possession of the property at the time of the condemnation and that the grantor had not given the friend notice of the violation and an opportunity to cure, the interest will terminate automatically upon condemnation and the condemnation proceeds will be awarded to the grantor. Therefore, answer D is correct."

The equitable servitude was in writing and was recorded, providing constructive notice of it; actual notice was not required. Answer A is incorrect.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Pursuant to UCC 9-102(a)(3) and UCC 1-201(21) a security interest is created in certain specified situations by possession of a right to possession of land. When a party is granted a license to possess land, a security interest in that land is automatically created if the licensee uses the land as a home. Where the licensee makes improvements to the land, a security interest is created if the licensee has an option to purchase the land, or if the licensee is obligated to make payments to the licensor. Where the licensee is not obligated to make payments to the licensor, however, a security interest will only be created if the licensee has a right to possession of the land. Where the licensor retains possession of the licensee's keys, as in this case, the licensee will have a right to possession if the licensor fails to demand return of the keys for a period of one year. In this case, the woman had a license to possession of the land, which was subsequently converted to a lease by the parties' agreement that the woman could continue to live on the land. A rebuttable presumption arises that a license has been converted to a lease where the licensee has improved the land, paid the licensor, or both. Where the licensor retains possession of the keys, as was the case in this question, the license will be converted to a lease where the licensor fails to demand return of the keys for a period of one year. Because the woman had the friend's permission to stay on the land, the license was converted to a lease and the woman had a right to possession of the land. The friend's failure to demand return of the woman's keys for 10 years will create an automatic interest in the land for the woman. Therefore, C is incorrect. A is incorrect because the rebuttable presumption that a license has been converted to a lease does not apply where the licensee is granted the right to possession of land. B is incorrect because the UCC 9-102(a)(3) interest will only be created if the licensor fails to demand the return of the keys after one year. Where the keys were not returned for 10 years, the friend's interest would have been automatically forfeited to the woman."

If the amount necessary to cure the default exceeds the value of the property, the party in default may also offer the lender a deed to the property as full satisfaction of the debt. If the lender accepts the deed, the lender shall return any money paid by the party in default to cure the default. This is known as a pre-foreclosure \"cure\" option.

If the grantor performs one of these acts after the grantee has possession or title, the grantor will automatically terminate the grantee\u2019s interest in the portion of land affected by the act."

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

If the owner is not available, the lender may either obtain a court order allowing the mortgage to be recorded or obtain a note and mortgage from a family member who has been specifically empowered to mortgage the owner's property. A mortgage given solely to secure a loan to a family member is known as a private mortgage. The holder of a private mortgage has all the usual remedies for an default, including the right to bring a foreclosure action to enforce the mortgage. In this case, the facts indicate that the mother granted a mortgage on her motel to the bank to secure her son's loan. Although she did not sign the promissory note, she gave the bank the right to enforce the mortgage if her son defaulted. Therefore, the mother will be able to stop the foreclosure on the motel."

Under the statute of frauds, any contract with regard to land, including a mortgage, must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged in order to be enforceable. In this case, the facts indicate that the nephew made the mortgagee's interest in land subject to the mortgage more difficult to enforce by making the monthly payments himself without the niece's knowledge or consent.

The doctrine of exoneration applies when land that is subject to a mortgage is acquired at the time of death and an attempt is made by the specific legatee to claim that the mortgage must be paid from general estate assets, a scenario that does not exist here. Answer C is incorrect. A partition action is not required before bringing an action for contribution for making mortgage payments that, if not made, might have resulted in the foreclosure on the property by the bank.

When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement. Under the applicable statute, the degree of the crime (and, hence, the severity of the authorized punishment) depends upon the value of the property embezzled. Of what crime, if any, could the woman properly be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Embezzlement of $200,000.\nB. Embezzlement of $100,000.\nC. Embezzlement of $80,000.\nD.

            "explanation": "The woman was the trustee of a trust fund and had possession and control of the certificate of deposit. By cashing the certificate and investing the proceeds in a speculative stock, the woman breached her duty to preserve the trust fund for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The sale of the stock resulted in a personal financial benefit to the woman, which she should have left in the trust fund for the beneficiaries. With the sale of the stock, the woman converted trust property to her own use, and she is criminally responsible for the embezzlement of the $100,000 of the certificate of deposit."

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled. Answer D is incorrect because the woman did embezzle $100,000; see the explanation for answer B.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Defense counsel should request an instruction on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. On the facts described, a jury could potentially conclude that the woman did not act with the sort of aggravated recklessness necessary to constitute depraved-heart homicide or extreme-indifference murder, even though she was intoxicated and driving in an unlawful manner. Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself. Even if understood as the offense of \u201cpublic intoxication,\u201d this offense would be a poor choice because public intoxication is not a lesser included offense of murder.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

Thus, the jury could rationally find the defendant guilty of simple theft, even though the jury found the defendant guilty of aggravated theft. B is incorrect because the value of the property is an element of the offense of aggravated theft. If the jury finds the value of the property was not more than $1,000, it will find the defendant guilty of simple theft, not aggravated theft. A is incorrect because the court may instruct the jury on any lesser included offense of a charged offense. The defendant must request the instruction, however. D is incorrect because the jury may find the defendant guilty of aggravated theft, if it finds the value of the property was more than $1,000.

            "explanation": "A conspiracy is an agreement by two or more persons to commit a criminal offense, and the agreement must include the intent that the offense be committed and an agreement to aid one another in its commission. In order for the man to be guilty of the conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the man must have agreed with his friend to commit a robbery, and the robbery must have involved an intent to steal and the use of an arm (any weapon or dangerous implement) that could be used to inflict death or serious bodily harm. The fact that the friend had a gun does not, by itself, mean that the robbery involved the use of any weapon or dangerous implement; it depends on whether the friend intended to use the gun during the robbery. If the friend intended to use the gun to frighten the victim into handing over her purse, the robbery would not involve the use of a weapon, but merely a fear that one would be used. On the other hand, if the friend intended to use the gun to take the purse, then the robbery would involve the use of a weapon. Likewise, the fact that the friend wore a gun does not, by itself, mean that the robbery involved the use of any weapon or dangerous implement; it depends on whether he intended to use it during the robbery. If he intended to use it to frighten the victim into handing over her purse, then no weapon was used. If he intended to use it to take the purse, then a weapon was used. Thus, if the man agreed with his friend to commit a robbery that involved the use of a weapon or dangerous implement, then the man could properly be convicted of the conspiracy to commit armed robbery. On the other hand, if the friend's intent was to use only fear to achieve the taking of the purse, then no weapon was used and the man could not properly be convicted of the conspiracy to commit armed robbery."

If the motion is not made before trial, the defendant is deemed to have waived his or her right to raise the issue of illegal search and seizure. B is incorrect. The good-faith exception does not apply to violations of the Fourth Amendment. And the statute at issue here violates the Fourth Amendment. C is correct. The police can obtain a DNA sample from a person who has been arrested for a felony if the person agrees to the collection. The person, however, has the option to refuse. The defendant did not refuse, so the collection of the DNA sample here was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but the police acted unconstitutionally by not giving the defendant the option to refuse. D is incorrect. The good-faith exception does not apply to violations of the Fourth Amendment. And the statute at issue here violates the Fourth Amendment."

Explanation: (Analysis of the facts supporting the best possible answer choice for the scenario, taking into account relevant laws and principles)\n3. Chosen Option Label: (The letter corresponding to the correct answer choice)\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAssigned counsel for a capital defendant had heard that his client had an unsavory background and a highly dysfunctional childhood. He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Yes, because defense counsel is required to present any known mitigating factors in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A is correct. Ineffective assistance of counsel is shown by (1) actual representation, (2) that was deficient, (3) resulting in prejudice. Actual representation is present in this case because the defendant was represented at trial. Deficient representation is present if the representation falls below the standard for reasonableness at the time of the proceeding, considering the facts of the case and the experience of counsel. The third prong is not applicable because there has not yet been a judgment of conviction. B is incorrect because the standard for reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel is the prejudice standard, not the reasonableness standard. C is incorrect because the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient, not that the defendant wishes to relitigate the factual basis for the conviction. D is incorrect because the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient, not that mitigating evidence was not presented."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
