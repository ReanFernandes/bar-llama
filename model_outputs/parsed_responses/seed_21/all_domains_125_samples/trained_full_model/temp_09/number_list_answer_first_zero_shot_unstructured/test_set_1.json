            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The car manufacturing company's distribution of cars is not relevant to the analysis of diversity jurisdiction because the Erie doctrine applies in diversity cases and under it, a court is required to apply the state law's definition of what constitutes a \"residence\" for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. See, e.g., Mullane v. Direct Marketing Assocs., 501 U.S. 44 (1991); O'Connor v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 399 U.S. 279 (1970). B is incorrect. Minimum contacts is relevant to personal jurisdiction, not diversity jurisdiction. See, e.g., Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., 480 U.S. 102 (1987). C is incorrect. A party's residence is not necessarily where its headquarters are located. Moreover, for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the term \"residence\" is defined according to state law. D is correct. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the term \"residence\" is defined according to state law. Therefore, the shareholder's attorney needs to know where the company is incorporated."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. Here, the first defendant is not a citizen of the state in which the original lawsuit was filed. B is correct. The removal statute calls for a 30-day deadline after which any claim that was not timely removed will be deemed to have been waived.

Instead, the original state claim is still pending and the action is simply now governed by the removal statute. As explained above, this means that the removal is timely. D is incorrect. Here, the original lawsuit was filed in State B because that is where the first plaintiff was a citizen. However, the second defendant was a citizen of State C. Therefore, there was no diversity between the parties when the lawsuit was initially filed.

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

However, the defendant has waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by failing to raise it in her initial answer. By failing to raise the defense, the defendant waived the defense. Here, the waiver of the defense is effective because it is timely. Pursuant to Federal Rule 12(h), a defense that is not presented in the first reply or answer to a complaint will be considered waived. Therefore, because the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction was not presented in the defendant's initial answer, it is waived. B is incorrect. Here, the court may consider the merits of the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, but for the reasons stated above this defense is waived. C is incorrect. The minimum contacts requirement applies only to suits in foreign countries, not to suits in federal court against out-of-state defendants. See Carnegie-Mellon University v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 (1988). D is incorrect. There is no requirement that process be personally delivered to the defendant.

The defendant is not domiciled in State A and only visits there periodically for reasons unrelated to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Answer A is incorrect. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h) permits litigants to raise personal-jurisdiction challenges for the first time in an answer that is amended as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1). Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants. Answer D is incorrect. Personal service under Rule 4 can occur at any location, not just the person\u2019s home. State A nonetheless lacks personal jurisdiction because the defendant was not served in State A and lacks minimum contacts with State A, as explained above.",

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. It is true that a party must be served with a complaint before that party may be required to answer it. However, under Federal Rule 4(e), when a request for waiver of service is included in the initial papers served on a defendant, the party making the service request is not required to effect personal service: \"A request to waive service under this rule does not require personal service.\" Therefore, it is permissible to effect service by mail as the plaintiff did. B is correct. Under Federal Rule 5(b)(2)(B), a court may enter a default judgment when a party against whom judgment has been entered does not return a request to waive service within 30 days. Here, the defendant did not return the waiver request within 30 days. Instead, 61 days passed with no response from the defendant. Therefore, the court cannot enter a default judgment against the defendant. C is incorrect. Under Federal Rule 5(b)(1)(B), a court may enter a default judgment when a party against whom judgment has been entered fails to plead or otherwise defend a claim in the action after being properly served. Here, the defendant failed to plead or otherwise defend the claim after being properly mailed a request to waive service. Therefore, the court can enter a default judgment against the defendant. D is incorrect. Here, the plaintiff followed the correct procedure for mail service under Federal Rule 4(e): the plaintiff mailed the request to waive service, two copies of the request, and a copy of the complaint to the defendant's managing agent. The only requirement that must be met for effective service by mail is that the request must be mailed to the person to be served or to that person's last known address. Because the plaintiff followed the correct procedure for mail service, no further action is required on the plaintiff's part."

Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

However, it is irrelevant whether the evidence or witnesses are local when deciding whether to transfer a case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406. B is correct. The best argument in support of a motion to transfer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406 is that the case involves common questions of fact with similar actions that are pending in another federal court and those actions are a means of preventing the same claim or controversy from being tried twice. C is incorrect. The argument in C is a venue argument, not a transfer argument. For the sake of convenience, we will sometimes refer to arguments regarding transfer and arguments regarding venue as \"motions\" even though they are actually requests.

Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect.

Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

In describing the events that led to the false accusations, the complaint quoted a statement of a competitor made to the employer about the worker\u2019s alleged theft. During discovery, the worker deposed the competitor. One week after discovery closed, the worker moved to amend the complaint to add the competitor as a defendant. The competitor opposed the motion on the ground that the statutory limitations period had expired. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery has closed, and the competitor will be prejudiced.\nB. No, because the amendment would not relate back and thus would be futile.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Courts may deny leave to amend when the claim to be added is futile. Here, the claim is futile on limitations grounds unless relation back applies. Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.",

Even if the instructions were erroneous, the defendant has to show that the errors affected the defendant's substantial rights.

A court has discretion over which instructions to give, and that discretion is subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review on appeal.

Answer B is incorrect. There is no obligation to seek a new trial before challenging jury instructions on appeal, so long as the applicable plain error standard can be satisfied.

Plain error, not abuse of discretion, is the standard for reviewing instructions that the parties did not object to, as was the case here. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer D is incorrect. For most objections to jury instructions, the objection must be made before the instruction is given to the jury. There is no 28-day window after the jury is instructed to object to any instructions.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC. The court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law because he implicitly assumed the risk of the manager\u2019s carelessness.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is correct. A motion for summary judgment will be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A question of fact exists as to whether the friend was a mere passive observer or actually intended to take possession of the padlock. However, the friend is not the party seeking to recover from the store; the delivery driver is. The delivery driver has stated an actionable claim against the store for negligence, and the friend is her assignee. Under the facts of this case, the assignee has the same rights as the assignor, so the friend has a viable negligence claim against the store. The issue in this case is not the friend\u2019s right to recover, but rather the applicability of an assumption-of- risk defense. This is a pure question of law, and the court can and should rule on it as a matter of law. B is incorrect. The court cannot deny both motions. Motions for summary judgment are decided on an issue-by-issue basis. If there is no genuine issue of material fact on an issue, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on that issue. If there is a material fact in dispute, the court does not consider the issue at all, but instead considers the appropriateness of a motion for directed verdict. C is incorrect. An action assumes risk when the plaintiff voluntarily and with full knowledge of the risks undertakes a dangerous activity that is unreasonably dangerous to his or her own safety. It is an affirmative defense to a negligence claim that the plaintiff assumed the risk of the defendant\u2019s carelessness. The friend did not voluntarily and with full knowledge of the risks undertake to retrieve the padlock. He was asked to retrieve it by the driver, and he did so only after the manager had cut the rope holding the boxes in place. The friend\u2019s action was reactive, not voluntary, and there is no indication that he knew of the risks associated with walking toward a pile of boxes that were potentially being held in place by a rope. D is incorrect. The court should not rule in the store\u2019s favor based on the assumption of risk. As stated above, an assumption-of-risk defense is an affirmative defense to a negligence claim. If the defendant does not plead and prove an assumption of risk, the plaintiff can prevail in a negligence claim if she can prove breach of duty by the defendant and damages. If the defendant does plead an assumption of risk, the plaintiff cannot prevail unless she can"

Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect.

The complaint alleged that the fire had been caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the house\u2019s electrical system in accordance with the applicable housing code. The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent. In opposition to that motion, the tenant argues that under federal law, contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defendant who wishes to assert the defense must plead in an answer or other responsive pleading. Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB. Federal law, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control pleading in federal court.\nC. State law, because the application of federal law would be outcome-determinative.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The burden imposed by Federal Rule 8(a)(2) is a procedural burden: it requires parties to file a complaint that provides a short and plain statement that gives the court and opposing parties notice of the party's claims or defenses. B is incorrect. Federal Rule 8(a)(2) does not impose a burden on parties when they file an answer or other responsive pleading. C is correct. The burden of pleading is an important part of the case or controversy requirement, which is an indispensable part of the constitutional requirement that there be a complete and final adjudication of a dispute. Therefore, the burden of pleading is a substantive requirement that is particularized to the case or controversy at issue. A party does not need to plead an affirmative defense, such as contributory negligence, if it is not a necessary element of the claim or defense being asserted. Therefore, whether a state requires plaintiffs to plead contributory negligence or not is an issue that may be litigated in a case or controversy if it is an element of the plaintiff's claim. However, if it is not an element of the plaintiff's claim, then the plaintiff does not need to plead it, and the defendant can assert it as an affirmative defense. Therefore, which state's law governs depends on whether the tenant's claim or the landlord's defense is the claim or defense that has the burden of proof. Here, the tenant's claim is a negligence per se claim, and the state's law that applies to the elements of that claim determines the elements of the claim. That is an issue for state law because each state has its own negligence per se standard. Therefore, the tenant does not need to plead contributory negligence, and the landlord cannot assert it as an affirmative defense. D is incorrect. The tenant's rights under the lease are determined by federal common law, which does not incorporate the state's rules regarding the burden of pleading."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. When a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure is valid and on point, it controls over a conflicting state rule. Rule 8(c)(1) is on point because it specifically provides that contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defending party must assert in its answer to the complaint. The rule is a valid exercise of the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power, because the manner of pleading defenses is an issue that can rationally be classified as procedure and the rule itself regulates the manner and means by which the parties\u2019 rights are enforced. Answer A is incorrect. The question of who has the burden of pleading, in contrast to the burden of proof, in federal actions is a procedural matter within the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power. Answer C is incorrect. The \u201coutcome determinative\u201d test applies only when asking whether a state rule that conflicts with a judge-made federal practice should be followed. It does not apply when federal law comes from a valid and on- point federal rule. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. Federal question jurisdiction extends to any case in which a well-pleaded complaint asserts either a claim arising under federal law or a claim in which a federal question is central to the action and has enough substance to provide the complexion of the action. Here, the investor\u2019s claim against the broker is based on a violation of federal securities law, which does in fact assert a claim arising under federal law. Therefore, the court has federal question jurisdiction over this case. B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are so related to claim in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy. Here, the contract claim is related to the investor\u2019s claim in the action within the original jurisdiction of the federal court because the contract claim involves the same transacting party, involves the same subject matter, and seeks a legal determination. Therefore, the contract claim has supplemental jurisdiction. C is incorrect. A counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of a claim against a party in the original action; if the original claim and the counterclaim do not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, the counterclaim is instead a claim against a person for whom the original plaintiff has insufficient legal authority to file suit. Here, the investor\u2019s claim against the broker arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the broker\u2019s contract claim, because the contract claim involves the same transacting party, involves the same subject matter, and seeks a legal determination. Therefore, the contract claim may be brought as a counterclaim. D is correct. Counterclaims are either compulsory or permissive. A claim is compulsory if it is so essential to the maintenance of the action that it must be litigated if the case is not dismissed. A claim is permissive if it is merely asserted to supplement a claim that has sufficient merit to support a separate lawsuit. Here, the contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim because it is essential to the maintenance of the broker\u2019s action against the investor. Without the contract claim, there would be no legal or factual basis for the broker\u2019s claim against the investor, and the court would be required to dismiss the broker\u2019s action."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

That provision does not require the advice and consent of the Senate for removal, so long as the presidential appointee has been confirmed by the Senate. Here, the statute creating the new agency provides that the director must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Because the director has not been appointed by the President, but has been confirmed by the Senate, the Constitution does not require the advice and consent of the Senate for removal. A is incorrect. Congress cannot create the office of the director and place conditions on her removal. The Constitution gives the President the power to remove executive officers, and the Constitution does not condition that power on any kind of pre-removal proceeding. C is incorrect. Separation of powers is not the appropriate constitutional issue here. The issue is not whether Congress has usurped too much power from the President, but whether the statute violates the Constitution by requiring the advice and consent of the Senate for the removal of a presidential appointee when the statute created the position without any such requirement. D is incorrect. Congress may impose any conditions on the removal of a presidential appointee that does not violate the Constitution. Here, the Constitution does not require the advice and consent of the Senate for removal because the director is not an appointee of the President, but was instead confirmed by the Senate."

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts.

Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard.

A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race.

Under UCC \u00a7 2-206, an offer made by an order of goods may be accepted by the shipment of goods or by a prompt promise to ship. Here, the shipment of the laptops constituted the manufacturer\u2019s acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer and the terms set forth in the offer. Answer A is incorrect. The manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops was a reasonable mode of acceptance and gave rise to a contract. Answer B is incorrect. The retailer\u2019s order constituted an offer, and a contract was formed when the manufacturer shipped the laptops. Therefore, the exclusion of consequential damages in the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment constituted a request to modify that contract. The exclusion would become a term of the parties\u2019 agreement if the retailer assented to it, which did not occur here.   Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The plumber's website contained a price term that the parties implicitly agreed to when the plumber accepted the homeowner's job. The website's price term was not unconscionable and therefore is enforceable. A is incorrect. The terms of a contract may be expressed or implied. Implicit contract terms are enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought had reason to know of the term. Here, the parties had an implied-in-fact contract for the plumber to unclog the drain and charge the homeowner an hourly rate comparable to that of other local plumbers. This contract was enforceable because the plumber had reason to know of the express price term on his website. C is incorrect. The homeowner may not take advantage of the plumber's reliance on his promise to pay a reasonable sum if there is an enforceable contract that specifies a different amount. However, there is no such contract here because the parties did not agree on a price. D is incorrect. The restitutionary interest is the amount of damages that a party is entitled to receive for a breach of contract. The amount is intended to restore the party to the position he or she occupied before the breach. The homeowner is not entitled to recover damages for breach of contract (because that is an expectation interest), but only the reasonable value of the services (a restitutionary interest)."

On numerous occasions, the wife\u2019s brother had offered to buy the farm from her, but she had always refused. The husband died suddenly in an accident. The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The wife's strongest argument for rescinding the contract is that the contract was unconscionable at the time that it was made. Specifically, the contract was unconscionable because it did not provide the wife with enough time to obtain independent legal advice regarding the contract, and it did not adequately provide for the wife's future needs. A is incorrect. Duress cannot be the basis for rescinding a contract unless the contract has been coerced into existence by an illegal threat of force or constraint. At common law, a husband cannot be duressed into executing a deed of land on behalf of his wife. The husband's execution of the deed is required by statute, and his execution is not coerced into existence by any threat. B is incorrect. A contract may be voidable on grounds of mistake if the contract was entered into based on a mistake of fact or law that was made by the parties at the time of contracting and that materially affected the parties' legal rights and obligations under the contract. However, the time for contracting for mistake of fact is short. If the mistake is one of fact that is discovered within a year after the parties enter into a contract, the contract is voidable. Here, the wife's mistake of fact relating to the need to sell the farm to support her children materialized within a year of the parties' contract. Therefore, the contract may be voided on grounds of mistake. However, unconscionability is a broader basis for rescission than mistake. Mistake of fact that is not material or that is not made by the parties at the time of contracting does not suffice to avoid a contract. In addition, unconscionability is relevant in determining whether a court will enforce a contract that is not supported by bargained-for consideration. Here, the wife has an argument that the contract is unconscionable and thus may be avoided. A is incorrect. Duress is not the only type of improper pressure that may render a contract void. Pressure to enter into a contract that takes unfair advantage of the other party's weakness is also sufficient. Here, the wife's argument is that the contract is unconscionable because the brother took advantage of the wife's grief and lack of business experience to obtain a signature on an important document that was not fully explained to her. D is incorrect. Undue influence is irrelevant to the wife's argument for rescinding the contract. Undue influence is a basis for avoiding a will, not a contract.

The Statute of Frauds mandates that promises made to answer for the debt of another generally fall within the suretyship clause of the statute and therefore must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute. However, the promisor is not generally considered a surety, and therefore not subject to the statute, when the promise is for a fixed duration and the amount of compensation is determinable with certainty. Here, the executive's promise to the consulting firm is to be the firm's president for life. Although the parties have not yet agreed on the executive's salary, they have agreed to the \"terms of the employment except for the salary,\" which can be determined by reference to the prevailing salary for such positions in the area and therefore is an amount that can be fixed in the parties' writing. Because the executive's promise to be the firm's president for life does not fall within the suretyship provision of the statute, the agreement is oral and thus enforceable. A is incorrect. The Statute of Frauds does not apply to promises to answer for another's debt if the promisor is not a surety. Here, the executive is not a surety because the promise is for a fixed duration and the amount of compensation is determinable with certainty. C is incorrect. The Statute of Frauds does not apply where the promisor is not a surety. Although the executive's promise to be the firm's president for life might appear at first blush to be a suretyship promise, it is not subject to the suretyship provision of the statute because the parties have not made a promise to answer for the debt of another but rather have made an employment contract that can be enforced without a writing under the oral employment contract rule. D is incorrect. Because the executive's promise is not a suretyship promise, the Statute of Frauds does not apply. The executive's employment contract with the firm is oral and thus enforceable."

However, the requirement does not apply where the contract involves a unilateral mistake of fact that the party against whom enforcement is sought had no reason to know or suspect, and where the party seeking enforcement is the innocent party and had no knowledge of the mistake. Here, the contractor purchased lumber at a cost of $60 per 100 board feet, a price that was unknown to both parties when they signed the writing. The contractor is entitled to recover the difference between the contract price and the market price, and, therefore, is the innocent party with a valid claim against the landowner. A is incorrect.

The parol evidence rule will not bar the introduction of the written evidence of the contractor's performance. The writing will be reformed to reflect the intent of the parties. D is incorrect.

The neighbor and the heir later discovered that the painting was worth over $900,000. Would the heir be likely to prevail in an action to rescind the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the heir bore the risk of any mistake as to the true value of the painting.\nB. No, because the neighbor possessed no specialized knowledge of the true value of the painting.\nC. Yes, because enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable, given its disadvantageous impact on the heir.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Mistake can be the basis for rescission of a contract where the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract and results in a substantial difference between the contracted-for good and its market value. Under the UCC, which governs the sale of goods, a contract for the sale of goods is subject to rescission if the contract was entered into through mutual mistake of fact relating to a fundamental assumption of the contract and there is a material difference between the contracted-for good and its market value. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of mistake even if the contract does not involve a error of law. Here, the facts indicate that the heir and the neighbor both made a mistake as to the value of the painting. More importantly, the painting had a market value of over $900,000 at the time of contracting, which is more than double the contract price, and therefore the painting's value is material to the parties' contract. Therefore, the contract may be rescinded on grounds of mistake. A is incorrect. Many jurisdictions will enforce the contract, even where one party bears the risk of a mistake, as long as the mistake does not involve a violation of law or a fundamental assumption of the contract (which is the case here). B is incorrect. An individual's lack of expertise in appraising art does not preclude her from entering into a contract for the sale of a painting, nor does it make her liable for the other party's losses in the event of a mistake. C is incorrect. Unconscionability relates to the procedural aspects of a contract (e.g., whether the other party was given a fair opportunity to understand and assess the contract), while mistake relates to the substance of a contract (whether the contracted-for good conformed to the parties' expectations). Unconscionability and mistake can overlap (e.g., a contract may be unconscionable because it fails to reflect the parties' agreement, which was reached after the heir and the appraiser mistakenly believed that the painting was not valuable), but unconscionability is not the only basis on which a contract may be rescinded."

            "explanation": "C is correct. Generally, an express condition to a contract obligation will be excused if the condition occurs or occurs in good faith. However, if the contract involves a public purpose and the condition is one that cannot reasonably be expected to occur in the usual course of things, then the condition is not excused even if there was no fault or good faith lacking. In this case, the engineer-developer contract involved a public purpose (the development of a project involving a large public interest) and the condition that failed to occur was the engineer's obligation to obtain government approval. Therefore, the engineer is likely to prevail, because the failure to obtain government approval will be excused by governmental action. A is incorrect. The condition to the developer\u2019s obligation to pay was that the engineer obtain government approval of the project. As explained above, the failure of this condition will be excused by governmental action. B is incorrect. It is true that breach of contract may give rise to liability for the breaching party's expectation damages (i.e., the reasonable value of what the non-breaching party gave up by reason of the breach). However, expectation damages are not the only kind of recoverable damages. In some cases, a breaching party may also be liable for restitution of the benefit conferred on the non-breaching party (i.e., the reasonable value of what the breaching party received). Here, the engineer appears to have provided a reasonable benefit to the developer: The engineer's services in completing a feasibility study and master plan undoubtedly gave the developer a legally enforceable property interest in its plans and helped ensure that its investment in those plans would not be wasted. Therefore, the engineer is entitled to recover not only expectation damages (which, as explained above, are not measured by the reasonable value of what the engineer gave up by reason of the developer's breach), but also restitution of the reasonable value of the engineer\u2019s services, and thus to recover all of the amount owed to him by the developer. D is incorrect. If a contract involves a public purpose and the condition is one that cannot reasonably be expected to occur in the usual course of things, then even if there was no fault or good faith lacking, the condition is not excused. Therefore, it is not necessary to show that the government's action was purposefully or consciously wrongful. In this case, the condition that failed to occur was the engineer's obligation to obtain government approval. Therefore, as explained above, the failure of this condition will be excused by governmental action."

            "explanation": "C is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a contract is conditioned upon the happening of an event, even if the contract does not explicitly state that the event is a condition. However, when one party materially breaches a condition to the other party's duty to perform, the breaching party is discharged of its duty to perform. Here, the subcontractor's bid was conditioned upon its being accepted by the engineering firm. When the subcontractor bid $100,000 to do the electrical work on the project, that bid was not accepted. Therefore, at the time the subcontractor withdrew from the contract, the condition to the subcontractor's duty to perform had not occurred. Because of the subcontractor's material breach, the engineering firm is excused from performing under the contract. A is incorrect. Nominal damages are given for breach of contract where the breach has caused only a minor or trivial harm. Here, because the engineering firm was able to complete the project at a profit, the breach is not trivial and thus the engineering firm is entitled to expectation damages, which are calculated to give the injured party the benefit of the bargain. B is incorrect. Reliance damages are recoverable where an injured party has justifiably relied on a contract, even if the contract was not completely integrated. However, an injured party cannot take advantage of the other party's silence or inaction, even if it would induce the injured party to rely. Here, the subcontractor was not required to bid on the project; the bid was voluntary. Therefore, the engineering firm cannot claim reliance damages in connection with the subcontractor's bid. D is incorrect. If a contract involves consideration of an indefinite duration, a party may detach itself from the contract at any time by giving notice of termination. However, if consideration has been given for a specified period of time, the detaching party is still bound to perform for the duration of the contract. The subcontractor's bid was for a specified period of time, and its end was set by the subcontractor's completion of the work. Therefore, the subcontractor was only obligated to perform for 18 months."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

The only requirements that must be met for a conveyance of land to be valid (and thereby transfer legal title in that land from one party to another) are execution and delivery of the deed. The execution requirement is satisfied as long as the deed is signed by the party to be charged (the seller). Delivery of a deed is established by a proven intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. Execution and delivery of a deed, however, will not suffice to transfer title where the deed is void. A void deed is one that fails to meet a legal requirement that must be satisfied for the deed to be enforceable.

A quitclaim deed, however, must be accompanied by a writing that recites the consideration the grantor has received (or will receive) in exchange for the quitclaimed property. The absence of such consideration language in the father's deed to his daughter indicates that the deed is void ab initio (Latin for \"from the beginning\"), and thus he never executed it. Therefore, it was never delivered. B is incorrect. A contract for sale of land falls within the statutory execution and delivery requirements for all contracts if the contract meets the statutory description of a \"writing.\" A contract for sale of land is a writing if it is memorialized in any form that is evidence of a contract. In this case, the only writing the parties have provided is the deed, which is an instrument of conveyance, not a contract for sale. As such, it does not satisfy the requirements for a writing under the statute. Because there is no writing that can be offered as evidence of the contract, the contract is void ab initio, and the daughter did not receive any interest in the land as a result of the contract. C is incorrect. The daughter, not her father, owned the land, which was her mother's sole property when her father executed the deed to her. As such, her mother had no interest in the proceeds of her daughter's promise to pay $300,000 to her brother. Her mother had only a general reference to her daughter's promise in her father's will. D is incorrect. Consideration is required to support an exchange of promises (i.e., a contract). Consideration is not required, however, to support a transfer of property (an exchange of titles).

            "explanation": "B is correct. The company\u2019s strongest defense is that the homeowner suffered an injury that was not foreseeable. Ordinarily, a negligence action will not lie for pure economic loss unless the injury is foreseeable. In this case, the company's defense is that a reasonably prudent person would not have foreseen that placing the free furniture notice on the website would cause injury to the homeowner. This choice may seem tricky because it is a negligence issue, and the question asks for the company's strongest defense. Remember, however, that foreseeability is the province of negligence, and the company's strongest defense is the one that would most likely prevail if offered. A is incorrect. The company has a duty to exercise reasonable care in conducting its business. That duty may extend to its customers, if the company has a foreseeable risk of injury to a customer. C is incorrect. The First Amendment does not prohibit all tort actions based upon speech. In this case, the company's website is not state action and thus is not governed by the First Amendment. D is incorrect. If there is an issue of fact as to the company's carelessness, a negligence issue cannot be decided on summary judgment.

The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals.

But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB. No, because the former employee could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts.\nC.

            "explanation": "B is correct. This is an issue of intent. The former employee is not allowed to compete with the established cemetery by inducing purchasers to breach their contract with the established cemetery. The established cemetery's contract with its customers was not a unilateral contract, which would allow customers to terminate their contract at any time for any reason. Instead, it was a bilateral contract, which meant that both parties had to take a unilateral action in order to terminate the contract. Therefore, the only way that a customer could get out of the contract was if the established cemetery agreed to let her out of it. The former employee is not allowed to step in and induce those customers to get out of their contract with the established cemetery without the established cemetery's consent. The established cemetery's right to a cancellation fee is a material part of its bargain with its customers, and thus NON-COMPETE is the appropriate way to analyze this situation. Thus, A, C, and D are incorrect. B is the best choice. A is a legal conclusion. The issue is not what the purchaser intended, but whether the former employee interfered with a valid contract. C is an incorrect statement of law. A customer who purchases a pre-need funeral plan has a terminable at-will contract, subject to a penalty. The contract is not terminable at the option of the customer, nor is it terminable at the option of the cemetery. D is incorrect because the issue is not whether the former employee was in competition with the established cemetery, but whether the former employee interfered with a valid contract."

The customer is responsible for 25% of the man's damages because the customer's negligence was equal to that of the man's. The owner is responsible for the other 25% of the man's damages because the owner's negligence was also equal to that of the man's. When the man's own fault is equal to the combined fault of the other parties, the man can recover all of his damages, minus the percentage that his own fault is of the total, from each defendant. The man's 25% fault in walking in front of a gun barrel is offset by his 25% recovery from each of the other parties. Thus, A is correct. B is incorrect. The man can recover 25% of his damages from the customer because the customer's negligence was equal to that of the man's.

The Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits a court from granting a plaintiff punitive damages in an amount that is so excessive as to amount to a deprivation of property or liberty interest in violation of substantive due process. Because the determination of what is excessive is an issue for a judge or jury to decide, the due process standard does not give juries a set ceiling on the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded. B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages if the plaintiff's injury was a foreseeable result of the defendant's conduct. Because the radiologist's failure to detect cancer on the X-ray was foreseeable, the patient's death due to cancer qualifies as the type of injury for which punitive damages may be awarded. C is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the due process clause does not require proof of willful or wanton misconduct before a plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages. Instead, proof of negligence is sufficient. D is incorrect. Contributory negligence is only a defense to an action for pure comparative negligence. The patient's smoking is irrelevant to the determination of his claim against the radiologist because the radiologist did not allege or prove that the patient's injury was a result of the patient's contributory negligence.

This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

            "explanation": "B is correct. The passenger was a licensee, not a customer, so the negligence per se rule does not apply. However, a jury could find the company negligent under a theory of res ipsa loquitur. Under this doctrine, if a negligent defendant allows a perilously dangerous machine to be placed in the care of a plaintiff and the machine causes an injury to the plaintiff, and the defendant fails to offer an explanation of how the injury occurred that satisfies the plaintiff's burden of proof, then the jury may (but is not required to) find the defendant negligent. Here, the company placed the elevator in the care of the passenger, and the elevator caused an injury to the passenger, so the company must prove that it was not negligent or a jury will find it to be negligent under a theory of res ipsa loquitur. C is incorrect. The court must tell the jury that it must find the company negligent if it was the proximate cause of the passenger's injury. However, a jury is not required to find the company negligent under a theory of res ipsa loquitur. Thus, the court should not instruct the jury to consider the passenger\u2019s carelessness if it finds the company liable. A is incorrect. The company cannot argue that the passenger\u2019s conduct was the cause in fact of his injury because the company placed the machine in the passenger\u2019s care, and it was the machine that caused the injury. D is an incorrect standard. The company does not get to argue that the passenger was negligent as a matter of law. A jury could find the company negligent under a theory of res ipsa loquitur if it so finds."

            "explanation": "A is correct. The assumption of risk instruction is an appropriate instruction in a negligence case where a defendant's duty of care has been breached and the plaintiff has been injured as a result. Assumption of risk is an affirmative defense, and must be asserted by the defendant. If it is not, the plaintiff can prevail in a negligence action as a matter of law. However, if the defense is successfully asserted, then the plaintiff's injury must be deemed to have resulted not from the defendant's breach of duty, but from a risk that the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly assumed. Because assumption of risk is an affirmative defense, the burden of proving it by a preponderance of the evidence falls on the defendant. Therefore, the instruction begins with the phrase \"If you conclude,\" because the jury must be instructed that the defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. A is also the best choice because it correctly states the appropriate burden of proof. Some jurisdictions require that the plaintiff bear the burden of showing that assumption of risk is inapplicable, but for the majority of the country, the burden shifts to the defendant once the issue is joined. B is incorrect. This answer begins with the word \"If,\" indicating that it is an instruction, but it is a faulty instruction. The instruction should not begin with \"If,\" because in this case, the plaintiff will not prevail if the defense of assumption of risk is successful. The plaintiff will lose if the defendant successfully asserts the defense. Therefore, \"If\" is the wrong word to begin the instruction. In addition, the phrase \"But that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk\" is an inaccurate statement of the law. Voluntariness and knowledge are irrelevant to the determination of whether assumption of risk is applicable. In addition, the phrase \"encounter the risk\" is also inapplicable because assumption of risk applies to the creation of a risk through the plaintiff's activity, not to the mere exposure to a foreseeable risk. C is an incorrect choice. Licensees have a number of rights and privileges, but they also have a number of corresponding duties and obligations. In contrast to a tenant who is occupying land as a lessee (and thus has the status of an invitee) for the purpose of finding and exploiting the land's economic potential, a licensee is one who is merely allowed by the owner to enter onto the property for some other purpose ("

The man\u2019s status as a licensee is not relevant to whether he assumed the risk of falling down the stairs. Answer D is incorrect.

The debt collector\u2019s threat to the woman that he knew where she lived and that he was going to withdraw money from her bank account was sufficient to cause the woman to reasonably fear that the debt collector was going to physically attack her. The debt collector intentionally caused the woman to suffer emotional distress through the threat of bodily harm and thus is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress. A is incorrect. Reasonable foreseeability is not the correct test for intentional infliction of emotional distress. In addition, the woman\u2019s great mental anguish, inability to sleep, and serious health consequences are not the only requirements that must be proven; the defendant\u2019s intentional actions must cause the victim to suffer emotional distress. C is incorrect. Industry custom is relevant to determine whether an action is extreme and outrageous, but it is not the only thing that must be proved for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Additionally, even if the debt collector\u2019s actions failed to comply with industry custom, the woman\u2019s great mental anguish, inability to sleep, and serious health consequences still would not be sufficient if the debt collector did not intend to cause her emotional distress. D is incorrect. Extreme and outrageous behavior is one of the four requirements that must be proven for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.

None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight.

Unlike a public nuisance, which is a violation of the common law and is actionable per se, a private nuisance is evaluated in light of the foreseeable and actual sensibilities of the community. In this case, the farmer is not creating a public nuisance, which would warrant a different burden of proof, because his placement of the items is not a violation of the common law and is not a public concern. Instead, the placement of the items is a private nuisance, which is evaluated in light of the foreseeable and actual sensibilities of the community. The farmer\u2019s best argument against liability is that his placement of the items is not extreme and outrageous, and thus it does not interfere with the homeowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her property. A is incorrect. The market value of the property may or may not be affected by the nuisance, depending upon the foreseeable and actual sensibilities of the community. In this case, the farmer\u2019s placement of the items may or may not have affected the market value of the property, depending upon how the members of the community feel about the items. If it is extreme and outrageous, it has gone beyond mere annoyance and has interfered with her property rights. Thus, the fact that the items have not decreased the market value of the property is not the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability. B is incorrect. Physical intrusion is not required. A private nuisance occurs when a party\u2019s activity interferes with another\u2019s use or enjoyment of their property, causing significant actual or potential harm. Physical intrusion is not required. In this case, the items do not intrude physically onto the homeowner\u2019s property, but they do interfere with the homeowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her property by creating an unwelcome view. C is incorrect. While this statement may be true, it is not relevant to a determination of the farmer\u2019s potential liability for private nuisance. It is important to remember that each case is evaluated in light of the foreseeable and actual sensibilities of the community. In this case, the items may or may not be common in the area, depending upon the foreseeable and actual sensibilities of the community.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

Evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to flee satisfies FRE 401\u2019s definition of relevance: it shows his consciousness of guilt and makes his guilt more probable than it would be without the evidence.

FRE 401 defines relevance as evidence having \u201cany tendency to make a fact [of consequence] more probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evidence that the defendant tried to flee from prosecution\u2014that he purchased an airplane ticket to another country using an alias\u2014satisfies the definition of relevance, because it shows his consciousness of guilt. Answer B is incorrect. Evidence of an intent to flee is relevant to show the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt but not to show his motive to commit the crime. The defendant\u2019s attempt to flee the jurisdiction after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime. Answer D is incorrect. Proof of motive is generally relevant and admissible, but evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to flee after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime. Because the evidence is irrelevant to motive, it is inadmissible if offered to prove motive.",

Explanation: (Analysis of the facts supporting the best possible answer choice for the scenario, taking into account relevant laws and principles)\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA plaintiff who lives near a factory has sued the company that owns it, alleging that a toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff to suffer a respiratory disease. The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the contractor and the homeowner, because neither posted a warning that the porch boards had been loosened.\nB. Neither the homeowner nor the contractor, because the friend was a licensee.\nC.

The homeowner\u2019s duty required him to make the porch reasonably safe for the plaintiff's use and to warn the plaintiff of any hidden dangers that were not open and obvious. The homeowner's duty did not extend to the contractor, because the contractor was an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the homeowner. The contractor had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the course of his work, and if that carelessness caused injury to the plaintiff, the plaintiff would have a claim against the contractor. Because the contractor was not the homeowner's agent or employee, however, the homeowner has no vicarious liability for the contractor's negligence. A is incorrect. If the homeowner had hired a painter directly to paint the porch, and if the painter had failed to warn the plaintiff of the loosened boards, the plaintiff could have a claim against the painter for the homeowner's benefit on a theory of respondeat superior.

The statement in the question is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted, namely that the man made defamatory statements about the woman. As such, it is hearsay.

Therefore, the woman can testify as to the contents of the letter without having to produce the letter itself. A is incorrect. The statement in the question is hearsay, but it is admissible as a statement of a party opponent. As such, the hearsay rule does not apply, and the statement can be used to impeach the man.

C is incorrect. Here, because the stockholder has no formal education or training in economics or the stock market, the stockholder cannot testify as an expert. Without sufficient education or experience in the relevant subject matter, the stockholder cannot articulate an opinion that has sufficient scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge. D is incorrect. The fact that the stockholder is a property owner does not mean that he can testify as an expert regarding the value of the corporation's stock. Here, because the stockholder has no formal education or training in economics or the stock market, the stockholder cannot testify as an expert. Without sufficient education or experience in the relevant subject matter, the stockholder cannot articulate an opinion that has sufficient scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The stockholder is a lay witness seeking to give testimony on causation that requires the specialized knowledge of an expert witness. Under FRE 701, the stockholder\u2019s testimony is inadmissible.   Answer B is incorrect. If otherwise qualified, an expert witness can have a personal interest in the outcome of the action and still testify. The expert\u2019s personal interest can be explored on cross-examination. In this case, however, the stockholder is not qualified as an expert. Answer C is incorrect. An admissible opinion about the cause of the price drop cannot be based on the stockholder\u2019s perception; it requires an expertise that he does not possess. His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue. Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 701, property owners are entitled to express opinions on the value of their property, but here the stockholder is expressing an opinion on the cause of the publicly traded stock\u2019s price drop. Such testimony requires a witness with specialized knowledge about the stock market.",

            "explanation": "A is correct. The statement to the police officer is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that the defendant sold the cocaine. As such, it is hearsay, and it does not fall into any exception to the hearsay rule. B is incorrect. The statement to the police officer is inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause of the Constitution because the woman is unavailable as a witness and the defendant has no opportunity to cross examine her. There is no other statement from the woman that could be used to fill the gap in the chain of custody, or to show that the defendant had the intent to go behind the back of the local official and sell cocaine. There is no other statement from the woman that would be admissible as a prior consistent statement or as a record of regularly conducted business. C is incorrect. The statement to the police officer is not a statement of a party opponent. It is a statement from a government informant, and it is being used against the defendant. D is incorrect. There is no evidence to show that the woman made the statement under threat of penalty to her or to show that the statement was made in response to a claim that she had made against the defendant. There is no evidence of any penalty that the woman suffered or is threatened with. The statement was made prior to the trial, and there is no evidence of any statement or conduct by the defendant that prompted the statement."

There is no hearsay exception that would apply to admit her statement against the defendant. Answer B is incorrect. The prosecutor\u2019s failure to establish the woman\u2019s unavailability is not the reason that her statement is inadmissible. Because there is no hearsay exception that would make the woman\u2019s statement admissible to prove its truth, it would be inadmissible even if the prosecutor were to properly establish her unavailability. Answer C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement was made to a police officer following her arrest and not during a drug conspiracy with the defendant. The statement also certainly did nothing to further a drug conspiracy, even if one did exist. Answer D is incorrect. The portion of the woman\u2019s statement attributing fault to the defendant and suggesting that he was her drug supplier was not against the woman\u2019s penal interest.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Preponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof that must be met to admit evidence in a civil case. In a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the proponent of the evidence (here, the prosecution). However, in a prosecution for a felony, the court is not required to instruct the jury that it must find all the elements of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the jury must find the elements of the charge by a preponderance of the evidence. Because this is a felony prosecution, the jury is not required to find all the elements of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt; instead, it must find the elements of the charge by a preponderance of the evidence. As such, the standard that should be used to determine whether the items have been properly authenticated is whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the items are what the prosecution claims them to be. A is incorrect. Clear and convincing evidence is the standard that must be met to prove the elements of a civil case or claim. There is no such thing as a \"clear and convincing\" burden of proof in a criminal case. B is incorrect. Chain of custody is important if the item of evidence is a sample of your urine (drug test), a hair follicle (also for a drug test), or other specimens that can be used for DNA analysis. However, in this case, there is no chain of custody requirement because the items are not biological samples subject to DNA analysis. C is an incorrect standard. This is the standard of proof in civil cases. In criminal cases, the proponent of the evidence (here, the prosecution) must prove the elements of the charge by a preponderance of the evidence."

The production of evidence \u201csufficient to support a finding\u201d that the evidence is what the proponent (here the prosecution) claims it to be is the proper standard for authentication under FRE 901.

A finding by the court that the prosecution has made a clear and convincing showing that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be is not required. That is too high a standard and would result in keeping relevant evidence from the jury. Answer B is incorrect. Proof of chain of custody\u2014what happened to the evidence after it was initially seized from the apartment\u2014is one way of authenticating evidence, but it is not necessary here, since the prosecution has called a witness who will testify that he saw each of the items in the apartment.

The defense may offer extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for the limited non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness after the witness has been given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Answer A is incorrect. The witness\u2019s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose. And since there is no applicable hearsay exception for the witness\u2019s statement to the investigator, it cannot be admitted to prove that the plaintiff did not fall.",

There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception.

However, the story can be used as a prior recorded statement under Rule 803(5) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Here, the newspaper article is admissible as a recorded recollection under Rule 803(5) because it reports on the plaintiff's bankruptcy proceeding and was prepared by the newspaper as a record of the proceeding.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(7), \"statements\" that are defined as a writing, recording, or photograph are self-authenticating; the requirement that the statement be under oath does not apply to these defined statements. However, the newspaper article is not a writing, recording, or photograph. Therefore, it must be authenticated by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the article is what its proponent claims."

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect.

Although the party to be charged (the grantee) does not sign the deed of gift, the covenant (and its accompanying obligation) still runs with the land, and is enforceable by and against the grantee. The purchaser had no actual notice of the covenant (it was never described in the purchase contract or in the title commitment, for example), but that lack of notice will not relieve her of the burden of the covenant. The covenant is enforceable by the mother, who retained ownership of a lot to which it was conveyed. A is incorrect. The mother is not estopped to enforce the covenant. She did not breach the covenant by constructing a three-story house on her own lot; she had the right to do so, since she had a lot to which the covenant applied. Her construction of a three-story house did not waive or modify the covenant. B is incorrect. Even if consideration is not required for an enforceable covenant, consideration is required for a valid transfer of rights via a warranty deed.

The fact that the woman chose not to sell it to the buyer produced by the broker is irrelevant. The only requirements that must be met for a valid real estate commission are that there be a bona fide sale of land and that the sale be at a price that is not less than the last recorded value. In this case, there was a bona fide sale of land (from the woman to the corporation) and the sale price ($249,000) was not less than the last recorded value of the property ($250,000). Thus, the woman is not required to pay a commission. A is incorrect. The fact that the listing agreement was not recorded has no bearing on the woman\u2019s obligation to pay a commission. It is important to note, however, that the sale of real property by a seller who is the agent of a buyer, even if the sale is at the price the property is worth, is still considered to be a sale by an agent. If the seller is the agent of the buyer, the sale is still subject to the commission. In this case, however, the woman was not the agent of the buyer; she was the sole owner of the property and had no agent. Thus, there is no requirement that she pay a commission to any real estate broker. B is incorrect because the sale to the corporation was after the termination of the listing agreement. Even if the buyer had been produced during the term of the listing agreement, the sale still would not have supported payment of a commission if it was at a price that was less than the last recorded value of the property. In this case, the sale price of $249,000 was not less than the last recorded value of $250,000. D is incorrect because it is irrelevant that the woman rejected the buyer.

The only requirements that must be met for a conveyance of land to be valid (and thereby transfer legal title in that land from one party to another) are execution and delivery of the deed. The execution requirement is satisfied as long as the deed is signed by the party to be charged (the seller). Delivery of a deed is established by a proven intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. Execution and delivery of a deed, however, will not suffice to transfer title where the deed fails to meet a specific writing requirement that is imposed by statute. In this case, there is no such statute. Although the deed to the nephew only called for delivery on the date of his marriage, it was sufficiently executed and delivered at the time it was given to the nephew to create a gift of a future interest. As such, the woman retained title to the property until the nephew married, at which time the deed would automatically transfer to him. Because the woman died before the nephew married, no interest in the property ever vested in the nephew, so answer B is correct. Answers A and C are incorrect. Answer D is incorrect because it suggests that the nephew\u2019s failure to marry before the woman\u2019s death caused the conveyance to fail.

The woman and the friend's agreement to deed each other the land after 10 years does not need to be included in the deed because it was superseded by the writing of the deed. The woman's attempt to enforce an oral agreement after the deed has been delivered and accepted is too late. A is incorrect because the fact that a rebuttable presumption may arise does not change the rule that a deed controls over any prior agreement. The agreement may be relevant evidence if the parties' intent is not clear from the deed, but it will not control if there is an unmodified, delivered deed. C is incorrect because the woman's right to possession was a right incident to the ownership of the land and was not unique to the woman. Any party to a property transaction has a right to possess that property. D is incorrect because an equitable mortgage is not the appropriate device to use in this situation. An equitable mortgage involves an obligation that secures a debt that is not yet due. In this case, the debt is already due and payable; it is simply unpaid. An equitable servitude is a restriction on the use or enjoyment of land that is part of the property.

The fact that the woman chooses not to redeem, or is unable to redeem, does not mean that she has lost her equitable right to do so. B is incorrect. There is no statute requiring a foreclosure sale for residential property. C is incorrect. Although a voluntary transfer of land, such as a quitclaim deed, cannot be the basis for a foreclosure, a mortgagee has the power to accelerate a mortgage (require payment in full on a mortgage) even if the debt is not due. Therefore, a mortgagor may make payments on a mortgage, even if the debt is not yet due, in order to keep the mortgage current. If the mortgagor stops making payments and defaults on the mortgage, the mortgagee may accelerate the mortgage, requiring payment of the entire outstanding balance of the mortgage, even if the mortgagor did not owe that amount when the mortgage was given. Therefore, the woman still owes the bank the amount of the outstanding mortgage balance, which amount the bank may collect by requiring the woman to pay the entire balance, even if she did not owe that amount when the mortgage was given. D is correct. A short sale is a sale of real property for an amount less than the outstanding debt on the property. In a short sale, the proceeds from the sale go to the holder of the first mortgage, who in turn agrees to release the debt (the second mortgage) that it holds against the property. In this case, the facts indicate that the woman owes more on her property than it is worth, and she has a first mortgage on it. If she finds a buyer for the property for an amount less than the amount owed on the first mortgage, the buyer (who has no knowledge of the second mortgage) would pay the proceeds of the sale to the first mortgage holder (the bank), which in turn would agree to release its claim on the second mortgage (the woman's mortgage) from the property. The sale of the property for less than the amount of the outstanding debt is a short sale."

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. It may or may not be enforceable, depending on whether the failure to perform was excused. B is incorrect. The statement that \"time is of the essence\" makes a contract that is silent as to time otherwise enforceable, but it does not make a contract that has a specific time for performance unenforceable. For example, if a contract called for a closing date of \"within 30 days,\" and the seller refused to perform after the 30th day had passed, the buyer could bring an action to enforce the contract. However, if the contract said \"we will close 30 days after the contract date,\" and the buyer failed to appear at the closing on the 30th day, the seller would not be required to perform. Here, the contract did not have a specific closing date. Instead, it provided that the closing would occur \"30 days after the date of the contract.\" Therefore, it was enforceable until the 30th day had passed. The seller's email made the closing date \"of the essence,\" which means that if the buyer failed to perform on the 30th day, the seller would not be required to perform. Because the buyer did not appear at the closing on the 30th day, the seller did not breach the contract. Therefore, the contract is enforceable. C is incorrect. The buyer's excuse for not appearing at the closing was not sufficient to excuse the failure to perform. Although the buyer was hospitalized and therefore not in a position to perform, he was not incapable of performing. He was not injured and therefore was not justified in not appearing at the closing. D is correct. The contract was not enforceable by its terms because it called for a performance that was to occur 30 days after the contract date. The seller did not breach the contract by failing to perform on the 30th day, because at the time the contract was entered, the seller did not intend to perform on that specific date."

Time may be made of the essence later if there is a reasonable time between the notice and the new date. Answer A is incorrect. A buyer can request a change in the closing date.

            "explanation": "The only way an owner can lose land through adverse possession is if the owner fails to have exclusive possession of the land for the length of the statutory period, maintains that possession continuously and without permission, and excludes others from possession. In this case, the woman was the owner of the property when it was conveyed to the city 20 years ago. At that time, the woman had an exclusive possessory interest in the land, which she maintained continuously (by not revoking the city's permission to use the land as a park) and without permission (because she did not give the city permission to stop using the land as a park). The city's use of the land as a parking lot for the last 17 years has been inconsistent with the woman's exclusive possession and has excluded others (the public) from using the land. Therefore, the son has lost his mother's land through adverse possession."

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect.

In this case, the mortgage on the motel was never recorded. Therefore, it is not enforceable, and the bank does not hold a lien on the motel. A is incorrect. The mortgage on the motel was not enforceable because it was not recorded. Therefore, the motel was not voluntarily mortgaged to secure the man's debt. B is incorrect. Although a mortgage creates personal liability on the debt secured by the property, a mortgage must be recorded on that property before the personal liability can be enforced. In this case, the mortgage on the motel was not recorded, so the mother has no personal liability on the man's debt. Therefore, the bank cannot hold the mother liable on the debt. C is incorrect. A promissory note must be secured by a mortgage (or another form of security) when it is executed. However, if the mortgage on the property is not enforceable, as in this case, no note is secured.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The requirement that a seller provide marketable title may be satisfied in one of two ways. The first way is for the seller to provide \"absolute\" title, which means that the title to the property is free of encumbrances (such as mortgages, restrictive covenants and easements). The second way is for the seller to provide \"complete\" or \"reasonable\" title, which means that the property is free of encumbrances that will not impair the buyer's ability to use and enjoy the property. Which of these two standards is applicable depends upon whether the contract involves a \"future advance\" (where the parties are exchanging a promise to convey a later gift) or a \"present sale\" (where the parties are exchanging a promise to convey an immediate gift). A title issue may be the basis for rescission of a contract for a future advance if the risk of loss has not been assumed by the buyer or if the title is not marketable. However, if the contract involves a present sale, a title issue may be the basis for rescission only if the property is not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it is being sold. In this case, the contract involves a present sale because the parties did not reserve any future rights or interests in the property. Therefore, the seller is required only to provide reasonable (complete) title, not absolute title. In the present sale context, a title issue will not allow the buyer to rescind the contract unless the property is not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it is being sold. Because the buyer intended to construct a gas station on the land, and can do so without violating any restrictive covenants (because he has paid the \"price\" of purchasing the property), the property was reasonably fit for that purpose, and the seller was not required to provide absolute but only reasonable (complete) title. A is incorrect. In the present sale context, as stated above, a title issue will not allow the buyer to rescind the contract unless the property is not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it is being sold.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The only requirements that must be met for a conveyance of land to be valid (and thereby transfer legal title in that land from one party to another) are execution and delivery of the deed. The execution requirement is satisfied as long as the deed is signed by the party to be charged (the seller). Delivery of a deed is established by a proven intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. Execution and delivery of a deed, however, will not suffice to transfer title where the deed violates the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds mandates that any contract for the sale of land must meet the execution and delivery requirements for a valid conveyance of land, or it will be void. In this case, the facts indicate that the woman purported to give the man title to the property by a deed, which should have satisfied the execution requirement, but that the man never accepted the deed. As such, the deed was never delivered to the man, and it is the statute of frauds that makes it void. A is incorrect. The deed to the man was not valid because it violated the statute of frauds. B is incorrect. Probate of a will does not serve to transfer title to the property that is bequeathed in the will. In this case, the man's will bequeathed his property (including the apartment building) to his wife, but it was the woman who executed and delivered a deed naming the man as the owner of the property. As such, the deed, not the will, controls the disposition of the property, and the deed's restrictions on transfer to the man's wife render her statutory right to take possession of the property after the man's death irrelevant to the ownership of the property at the time of the man's death. C is incorrect. Intent to revoke a gift of land may be shown by a return of the deed, but only if the grantee has accepted it. In this case, the woman's statement that she wanted to take back the deed was irrelevant because the man had not accepted it."

In this case, there is no evidence that the supplier intended to kill the lookout. The fact that the supplier and the dealer believed that the lookout was dead is irrelevant because the non-aggravated murder statute requires proof of an intent to kill. B is incorrect. The supplier did not have to intend that the fall from the cliff would kill the lookout; the supplier had to have the intent that the lookout be killed. The disposal of the body, in this case, is a foreseeable consequence of the intent to kill. Therefore, the supplier can be convicted of murder. C is incorrect. The disposal of the body need not be foreseeable if the murder is committed in the course of an aggravated robbery. However, in this case, the drug dealing operation is a non-aggravated murder scheme, and the murder of the lookout only becomes an aggravated robbery murder if the disposal of the body was foreseeable. Because the disposal of the body was foreseeable, an aggravated robbery is present and a jury could convict the supplier of aggravated murder. See Commonwealth v. Cummings, 366 Mass. 21 (1974).

She used her position to enrich herself, converting trust property, and should be convicted of embezzlement if the property embezzled was worth $100,000 or more. However, the woman only converted $100,000 worth of trust property, not the requisite amount of $200,000, to sustain a charge of embezzlement of the first degree (at common law). Embezzlement of the second degree requires proof of the conversion of property of the value of $200 to $500.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA), which applies this question's fact pattern, is designed to make sure that federal enclaves within a state are not areas where state law crimes go unpunished. However, the ACA does not make the federal court a forum for prosecuting state crimes; it simply applies the state's criminal law to federal enclaves within a state. As such, the ACA offense is the same as the state's offense, and the federal court must instruct the jury on the state's offense, not a federal offense. Because this is a state offense, the jury instructions must be modified to reflect the fact that this is a criminal justice system, not a federal one, and that the value of the property stolen is only a sentencing factor, not an element of the offense. A is incorrect because a court can instruct on a lesser included offense if the prosecutor has not charged the greater offense. In this case, the prosecutor has charged the defendant with aggravated theft, which requires proof of an element that the value of the property taken is over $1,000. Simple theft is a lesser included offense of aggravated theft because it requires proof of an element that the value of the property taken is less than $1,000. Therefore, if the jury finds the value of the property to be less than $1,000, then it must find the defendant guilty of simple theft, and not aggravated theft. Thus, the defense is entitled to an instruction on simple theft. C is incorrect because a court is not required to instruct on a lesser included offense. Instead, a court must give an instruction on a lesser included offense if the prosecutor has charged the greater offense and the evidence would not support a conviction of the greater offense but would support a conviction of the lesser included offense. In this case, the prosecutor charged the defendant with aggravated theft, which requires proof of an element that the value of the property taken is over $1,000. Simple theft is a lesser included offense of aggravated theft because it requires proof of an element that the value of the property taken is less than $1,000. However, the prosecution's evidence would not support a conviction of aggravated theft, but it would support a conviction of simple theft.

A is incorrect. An attempt is an act done with the intent to commit a crime where the act falls short of the full commission of the crime. In an attempt to commit murder, the man did not commit any act that would fall short of the full commission of the crime of murder, because he did, in fact, commit the act of offering to pay the officer to commit the murder.

An accomplice is one who encourages or assists another person in the commission of a crime. Here, the friend encouraged and assisted the women in the commission of bank robbery by driving the getaway car after the robbery. A is incorrect. An accessory after the fact is one who helps or encourages another person who has already committed a crime. Here, the friend did not help or encourage the women to commit the bank robbery after the fact; rather, he drove the women to the bank with the intent that they use his car to drive away after the robbery. Thus, the friend is an accomplice, not an accessory after the fact. C is incorrect. Conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a crime. Here, the friend did not agree with the women to commit a bank robbery. Instead, he agreed to drive them to the bank for a ride. D is incorrect. The friend is criminally responsible for the robbery committed by the women and is an accomplice to the crime."

Through a window, the officers saw a man, whose hands were bleeding, shouting and throwing things, but no one else appeared to be present in the home. When the officers knocked on the door, the man refused to respond. The officers then asked if he needed medical assistance. The man told them to leave and not come back unless they had a warrant. The officers then entered the home, and the man pointed a shotgun at them. The officers withdrew but later arrested the man for felony assault on a police officer. Alleging that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment, the man has moved to suppress the officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the man lacks standing to complain of an entry under the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment.\nB. No, because the warrantless entry was reasonable under the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because officers cannot use the emergency aid exception to justify a warrantless entry when only the suspect himself needs aid.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement does not apply to police officers seeking to render emergency aid to a private citizen; it applies only to police officers seeking to render emergency aid to a suspect or defendant. Because the man was only the owner of the property, the police officers were not rendering emergency aid to a suspect or defendant, and thus, the warrantless entry was unconstitutional. B is incorrect. The emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment does not authorize warrantless entries into private residences when the owner of the property is not a suspect or defendant. See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980). The fact that the owner of the residence needs medical attention does not make the police officers\u2019 entry reasonable under the emergency aid exception. C is incorrect. The emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment does not authorize warrantless entries into private residences when the owner of the property is not a suspect or defendant. See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980). The fact that the owner of the residence needs medical attention does not make the police officers\u2019 entry reasonable under the emergency aid exception. D is incorrect. A motion to suppress evidence based on a Fourth Amendment violation must be supported by an actual, or imminent, unlawful invasion of a private interest by the state. The man cannot claim an unlawful invasion when the officers were merely seeking to provide medical aid, which is a privilege, not a right."

            "explanation": "D is correct. There is no overt act requirement for conspiracy to commit armed robbery, and, because the woman ran away, there is no overt act requirement for conspiracy to commit robbery. However, because the friend did not have a license to carry a weapon, the showing of the gun in answer D violated the friend's obligation under the common law. As an obligation of the conspiracy, the man must be held criminally responsible for the friend's violation of the firearm laws. Therefore, a conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery would be proper, and conspiracy to commit robbery would also be proper. A is incorrect. Armed robbery requires proof of an intent to steal while actually having a weapon. Here, the friend did not have the intent to steal, and thus, there is no armed robbery. B is incorrect. Robbery requires proof of an intent to steal while actually having a weapon. Here, the friend did not have the intent to steal, and thus, there is no robbery. C is incorrect. Neither conspiracy offense can be committed without the intent that the overt act be committed. Because the friend did not have the intent to commit a robbery, there is no conspiracy to commit robbery.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The woman's actions in driving above the speed limit, losing control of her vehicle, and hitting the truck can all be considered as actions (whether intentional or not) that caused the death of the driver. As actions that caused the death of another, they are sufficient actus reus for a homicide charge. In addition, the woman's actions were done with recklessness toward human life, which is sufficient mens rea for a homicide charge. Because the woman's actions were both the cause-in-fact and the proximate cause of the man's death, she can properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter. A is incorrect. There is no evidence that the woman killed the man with premeditation and deliberation, which is the requisite mens rea for a murder charge. There is also no evidence that the woman's actions were done with the intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm, which would be sufficient for a felony murder charge. C is incorrect. While the woman's actions could properly be the basis for a manslaughter charge, manslaughter is a lesser included offense of the misdemeanor of reckless driving. As such, it cannot be the basis for a more serious homicide offense. D is incorrect. Because the woman's actions were sufficient to cause the death of another human being, the woman can properly be convicted of a homicide offense."

Under state law, police are required to obtain DNA samples from all persons arrested for felonies and to store those samples in a state registry.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The police obtained the DNA sample at the behest of the state, and the Supreme Court has held that such a sample is a \"biological sample\" under the Fourth Amendment. See Maryland v. King, 133 S.Ct. 1958 (2013). Therefore, the collection of the DNA sample must be reviewed under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. Here, there were no exigent circumstances justifying the collection of the DNA sample without a warrant. Thus, the court should suppress the sample. A is incorrect. The defendant's objection was timely both because his acquittal on the burglary charge (based on a motion to suppress the DNA evidence) constituted a final judgment, and because his objection could have been made earlier if he had not been convicted. See United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27 (2000) (concluding that Fourth Amendment challenge to warrantless DNA extraction from blood sample taken at hospital after automobile accident is timely even though blood was drawn pursuant to a properly issued search warrant). B is incorrect. Because the DNA came from a swab of the defendant's cheek, it is a \"biological sample\" under the Fourth Amendment. See Maryland v. King, 133 S.Ct. 1958 (2013). Therefore, the state's collection of the DNA violated the Fourth Amendment, and it should be suppressed. C is incorrect. Here, the police acted under the good-faith belief that the collection of the DNA sample was lawful. In United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27 (2000), the Supreme Court held that a Fourth Amendment challenge to the warrantless extraction of DNA from a blood sample taken at a hospital after a car accident is timely, notwithstanding a valid warrant to draw the blood. Nevertheless, the sample may be suppressed if the officer who obtained it did not have probable cause to believe that a warrantless seizure was lawful. Id. at 33-34. The police in this case acted under a good-faith belief that the DNA collection was lawful, based on the state statute requiring such collections from felony arrestees. However, because there is no exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement for the obtaining of a biological sample under the Fourth Amendment, the collection was unconstitutional."

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. A decision by counsel not to investigate, even if it was part of the defense strategy, can still be ineffective. In addition, a decision not to investigate cannot be strategic if it is based on counsel's reasonable belief that there is no merit to the claim or that the potential evidence is not strong enough to overcome the aggravation. Here, counsel's failure to investigate was not strategic because it was based on his concern that any information about the defendant's background would reflect badly on the defendant. Therefore, it was not a decision to forgo a potential defense. B is incorrect. The Constitution requires counsel to make an individualized assessment of the circumstances in each case and to present mitigating evidence when it exists. There is no \"objective\" standard here. Instead, counsel's performance must be measured by whether it was reasonable under the circumstances. In this case, the defendant's counsel failed to make an individualized assessment of the circumstances, which requires an investigation into the defendant's background for mitigating evidence. Instead, the counsel simply repeated the defendant's denials of the allegations against him from the guilt phase. Counsel's failure to do more than that is not constitutionally adequate. C is correct. A defendant's decision to plead guilty to a capital murder charge and to waive his right to a jury trial in the penalty phase does not waive his constitutional rights to counsel and to present mitigating evidence. Here, the defendant did not waive his constitutional rights when he waived his right to a jury and chose to have a judge determine his sentence. The Constitution requires that a judge must make an individualized assessment of the circumstances in each case and to present mitigating evidence when it exists. Therefore, the defendant's counsel's failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. D is incorrect. The Constitution requires counsel to present any known mitigating factors in the penalty phase of a capital murder case. In this case, the defendant's counsel failed to do so. Because the defendant's constitutional rights were violated, the court should grant the petition."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
