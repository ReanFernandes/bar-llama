Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Although it burdens the rights of individual owners, that burden is outweighed by the public interest. A is incorrect.

The state law does not impede interstate commerce in oil and gas production. C is incorrect. Inheritance is not a fundamental right, so a state may regulate it without strict scrutiny. D is correct.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the government may not punish an individual for wearing a political button, distributing a political pamphlet, or putting a political bumper sticker on his car. The government may not penalize an individual for such expression simply because it believes the message will influence voters in an election. Thus, A is incorrect. Also, the government may not penalize an individual for his or her associations simply because the government disapproves of the views of the organization with which the individual is associated. Thus, D is incorrect. C is incorrect. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder is incorrect. The mayor\u2019s action in rejecting the owner\u2019s bid because of the bumper stickers violates the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association and is thus a constitutional violation. The mayor\u2019s action is a viewpoint-based restriction of expression, and it is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. Thus, D is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

However, it has more limited power to provide financial assistance to states. Under the spending clause of Article I, Congress can provide such assistance to states, but the Supreme Court has held that this power is subject to several limitations. One such limitation is that Congress cannot require a state to enact a law or to administer a federal program. Here, because the state law at issue (the two-year residency requirement) is a state law that administers a state exemption from judgment creditors, it would be a violation of the spending clause for Congress to require the state to enact this law. A is incorrect because automobile negligence is a commercial activity.

B is incorrect because Congress can commandeer state legislatures to enact laws that implement federal policy as long as the spending bill containing the provision is passed to exercise spending power.

Because the easement is in use by the public, the state is bound by the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. That clause requires that any such taking be justly compensated. There is no indication that the owner was given any compensation for the taking of the easement. Therefore, the law is unconstitutional."

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land. Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here. Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue. Answer D is incorrect. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the taking serves a public purpose.",

The law here was passed after the woman committed the crime, so the law may not be applied to her.      Answer B is incorrect. Procedural due process requires that the government provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before depriving someone of a liberty interest or of an interest in property. The woman received that notice prior to trial, and the law provides an opportunity for a hearing. However, the law is an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to the woman. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest is not the proper standard. The ex post facto clause is violated by laws that increase the punishment for a crime after the crime was committed, even if the law furthers a legitimate interest. Answer D is incorrect.

In response to these complaints, the city council has enacted an ordinance that substantially limits the number and the size of billboards that may be erected along designated scenic roadways. A company that owns many of the billboards affected by this ordinance has filed suit, claiming that the ordinance violates the company\u2019s freedom of speech. Should the court uphold the ordinance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the ordinance burdens political speech and is not necessary to further a compelling government interest.\nB.

A is incorrect because the ordinance does not burden political speech. It burdens commercial speech because it regulates the location of commercial advertisements.

The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect.

And because the city has not shown that the ordinance will serve a compelling government interest and that it is the least restrictive means of serving that interest, the ordinance will not pass strict scrutiny. B is incorrect. While the ordinance is overly broad, this fact alone will not doom the ordinance to failure under strict scrutiny. Because the ordinance only prohibits a narrow category of expressive activity, it will satisfy the requirement that the city narrowly tailor its regulation to serve a compelling governmental interest. C is incorrect. The beach is not a public forum because the city did not intentionally open the beach for expressive activity. D is incorrect. This is not a sufficient reason on its own for finding the ordinance unconstitutional. Because the ordinance is a reasonable regulation of a limited public forum, it will pass strict scrutiny."

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The ordinance is overbroad because prohibiting all First Amendment activities on the beach restricts substantially more speech than the First Amendment allows to be restricted. Answer A is incorrect. The ordinance does not create a prior restraint on speech. Prior restraints are injunctions or administrative systems that prevent speech from occurring. The ordinance here is a mere prohibition of speech, penalizing speech after it occurs. Answer C is incorrect. A public beach is not a traditional public forum. The Supreme Court has limited such forums to streets, sidewalks, and parks. Nor is there an indication on these facts that the city had dedicated the beach as a speech forum. Answer D is incorrect. These facts are not sufficient to prove that the city enacted the ordinance because officials disapproved of the message of the protesters. The facts indicate that swimmers were unable to use the beach for several days because of the demonstrations. The concern for swimmers is a content-neutral interest that would permit the city to regulate demonstrations at the beach more narrowly.",

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect.

King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency.

That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v.

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

They connected the incidents because the vandal left specific graffiti at each site, and investigation provided the police with a reasonable suspicion that the perpetrator was a specific local resident. Using an online directory that the resident had joined, the police obtained the resident\u2019s cell- phone number. The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB. No, because the subpoena was based on a cell- phone number that the resident had voluntarily placed in the public domain.\nC. Yes, because a subpoena must be based on probable cause.\nD.

A is incorrect because a person does not have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party if that person has placed that information in the public domain.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

B is correct. A defendant is entitled to a jury that has been selected free of bias. Although the Constitution does not provide for a jury that is free of all potential bias, a court must excuse for cause any juror who has reason to believe he or she cannot judge the case fairly. When the juror in this case expressed some doubt whether she could be impartial, the court should have excused her for cause.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The issue in this case is what actions the woman was justified in taking when she saw the man breaking into her car. It is important to distinguish between defense of property and defense of self. In defense of property, the use of deadly force is never allowed, even to protect one's home. In defense of self, deadly force may be used in defense of one's home, but only in response to unlawful force against one's self or one's family. Because the woman was not being unlawfully threatened with force, she was not justified in using deadly force to defend her car. A is incorrect. The majority of states that recognize a right to stand one's ground and use deadly force in self-defense also require that the defendant make a proper retreat if feasible. Even if the woman had a right to use deadly force in defense of her property, she would still need to show that she made a proper retreat if feasible before using deadly force. Because the woman was within her house and thus could not properly retreat, a court would likely not give the jury the instruction requested. C is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct because the common law rule that deadly force cannot be used in defense of property remains the rule in virtually every state today. Answer A is incorrect. The \u201cduty to retreat\u201d rule, which has been removed in most states, limits one\u2019s ability to use deadly force in self-defense. The rule does not apply in defense-of-property cases because in that context deadly force is categorically disallowed. Answer C is incorrect because the act described\u2014intentionally shooting a man with a shotgun\u2014clearly qualifies as \u201cdeadly force.\u201d Although states define the term in various ways, \u201cdeadly force\u201d is generally regarded as the kind of force that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death whether or not the serious bodily injury or death actually occurs. Answer D is incorrect because the woman used deadly force, not in defense of her dwelling or real property, but in defense of her personal property\u2014namely, her car and her laptop.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

The defendant had retained private defense counsel. As part of the prosecution\u2019s case, a federal agent testified regarding incriminating statements that the defendant\u2019s confederate, who by the time of trial was a fugitive, had made during a prior interview. Though this testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, the defense attorney raised no objection. The jury ultimately convicted the defendant. The defendant has now hired new counsel for his appeal and argues that the admission of the federal agent\u2019s testimony was erroneous. If the appeals court finds that the trial court should not have admitted the testimony, does it have the authority to reverse a conviction when the trial attorney raised no objection to the challenged testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because failure to object waives a defendant\u2019s rights.\nB. No, because the sole remedy is a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nC. Yes, because a defendant cannot be penalized for an attorney\u2019s failure to object.\nD. Yes, because an appeals court may correct plain error affecting substantial rights.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct because, under the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, an appellate court may remedy an error that was plain or obvious if that error affected substantial rights. Here, the error was obvious, of constitutional dimension, and likely prejudicial. Consequently, the court of appeals has authority to reverse the conviction. Answer A is incorrect because, although a defendant\u2019s failure to object can change the standard of appellate review, it does not foreclose review. Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on direct appeal. For such errors, the defendant is not required to claim or prove ineffective assistance of counsel. Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, \u201cpenalized\u201d by an attorney\u2019s failure to object. Because the attorney did not object, the defendant must now meet the stringent requirements of the plain-error standard. Had the error been preserved by a contemporaneous objection, the standard of review would be more favorable to the defendant.",

The seller was aware that the car\u2019s actual mileage was approximately 90,000. Unaware of the car\u2019s actual mileage, the woman resold the car to a friend seven months later. At the time of the resale, the friend looked at the odometer, which read 30,000 miles, and said, \u201cGreat!\u201d By then, the actual mileage was 95,000.

Assuming no applicable statutes, is the friend likely to prevail in an action to rescind his purchase of the car from the woman?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the friend\u2019s reliance on the odometer reading was unreasonable, given that he did not have his mechanic check the mileage before he bought the car.\nB.

Before the subcontractor performed, it discovered that it had made an error in computing the size of the foundation and should have quoted the general contractor $18,000 for the work. The subcontractor informed the general contractor of the mistake and asked whether the general contractor would agree to pay $15,000 for the foundation, which would cover the subcontractor\u2019s costs. After determining that other subcontractors would charge at least $18,000 for the work, the general contractor agreed in writing.

Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the party seeking the modification and given by the party to whom the modification is sought. In this case, the subcontractor's mistake was unilateral; it conferred a benefit on the general contractor by allowing the general contractor to pay less for the work. In exchange for this benefit, the general contractor promised to pay the subcontractor $15,000. Although the modification is oral, it is supported by consideration, so the subcontractor will probably be able to recover $15,000. A is incorrect. the contract modification was supported by consideration. Therefore, a party cannot argue that the modification is unenforceable because of a lack of consideration. B is incorrect. the subcontractor's mistake was unilateral; it conferred a benefit on the general contractor by allowing the general contractor to pay less for the work. In exchange for this benefit, the general contractor promised to pay the subcontractor $15,000. D is incorrect. the value of the benefit the subcontractor conferred on the general contractor was $15,000, not $18,000. The subcontractor made a mistake in calculating the amount of the work to be performed, resulting in an overpayment of $3,000. The general contractor accepted this overpayment and agreed to pay the subcontractor $15,000. The general contractor did not promise to pay $18,000 in exchange for the subcontractor's mistake."

The builder has sued the homeowner for the $30,000 contract price of the first bathroom, which remains unpaid. What is the most likely result of the builder\u2019s suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The builder will recover nothing, because he materially breached the contract.\nB. The builder will recover the reasonable value of his work.\nC. The builder will recover in restitution the amount by which the bathroom increased the value of the homeowner\u2019s house, not to exceed $30,000.\nD. The builder will recover $30,000, because the contract is divisible into two parts.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Because the homeowner had no duty to pay the contract price for the second bathroom, there is no basis for recovery on that claim. B is incorrect. it is unlikely that a court will award the builder the reasonable value of his performance, because a breaching party is not entitled to recover damages measured by the difference between the contract price and the reasonable value of performance. C is incorrect. it is unlikely that a court will award the builder the amount by which the bathroom increased the value of the homeowner\u2019s house, because such an award would violate the doctrine of unjust enrichment. D is incorrect. the contract is divisible, which means that each party is free to perform a separate obligation, but a divisible contract is still a single agreement for purposes of the doctrine of constructive conditions. Thus, it is incorrect to suggest that the builder will automatically recover $30,000."

The ledger includes detailed information regarding the defendant\u2019s purchases and sales of drugs over a two-year period. The prosecutor is considering two alternative ways to lay the foundation for admission of the ledger as a business record. The first alternative is to call the police officer who executed the search warrant to testify that she found the ledger in the defendant\u2019s home. The second alternative is to call a codefendant, who has pled guilty, to testify that he was the defendant\u2019s drug supplier for over two years and that he was present when the defendant used the ledger to record their transactions as well as transactions with other buyers and sellers as they occurred. Which of the following is correct regarding the ledger\u2019s admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ledger may be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant.\nB. The ledger may be admitted through the codefendant but not through the officer.\nC.

A judge, however, can order a witness to testify if the judge finds that the witness has been properly subpoenaed and that the witness refuses to answer questions that are pertinent to the trial. Here, the plaintiff has not refused to testify; rather, he objects to the order that he testify first. B is correct. The trial judge has the authority to determine the order in which evidence is presented at trial. Her decision to require the plaintiff to testify first is an important part of that decision. Because the judge made the order to testify first to assist in the proper presentation of the evidence, she has not exceeded her authority. C is incorrect. A party is permitted to present evidence in the order of its choosing during its case-in-chief, but a party cannot unilaterally determine the order of presentation of evidence when other parties have witnesses to present. D is incorrect. Prejudice to the defendant is not a sufficient reason on its own for the judge to grant the plaintiff's request to present his evidence in an alternative order.

Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation.

One year later, a fire completely destroyed the woman\u2019s house and its contents, and she learned that the policy covered the cost of rebuilding the house but not the cost of replacing the contents. The woman sued the insurance company for breach of contract, claiming that when the agent sold her the policy, he did not notify her, as was legally required, that she would have to purchase a supplemental policy to cover the house\u2019s contents. At trial, the woman testified that the agent had not provided the required notice. The agent\u2019s supervisor plans to testify that the company issues thousands of policies through its agents each year and that it is the routine practice of those agents to discuss supplemental policy options with each customer. The woman\u2019s attorney has objected to this proffered testimony. Should the court allow the supervisor\u2019s testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because evidence of routine practice is not admissible when an eyewitness denies that the practice was followed.\nB. No, because issuing insurance policies to individuals is not sufficiently automatic to constitute a routine practice.\nC.

In this case, the supervisor\u2019s testimony would show that the insurance company has a routine practice of issuing policies through agents that does not require the agent to give a notice to the customer about the need for a supplemental policy. Because the supervisor\u2019s testimony is being offered for the company, it is admissible. A is incorrect because the supervisor\u2019s testimony is admissible as evidence of the company\u2019s routine practice, not because the woman\u2019s testimony would prevent its admission. B is incorrect because issuing insurance policies to individuals is a sufficiently automatic practice to be considered a routine practice. C is incorrect because the supervisor\u2019s testimony is admissible as evidence that the agent acted in a thorough manner when dealing with customers.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The routine practice of the company\u2019s agents in discussing supplemental policy options with customers is admissible under FRE 406. Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury. Answer B is incorrect. To constitute habit evidence, an organization\u2019s practice need not be \u201cautomatic\u201d but only routine\u2014something that is regularly done. The supervisor\u2019s testimony here is that the agents\u2019 regular practice is to discuss supplemental policy options with customers. Answer C is incorrect.

The court denied the motion. When the child entered the courtroom to testify, the defendant became unruly, moving as though he was about to lunge from his chair toward the child. The judge warned the defendant to stop the behavior. After a second warning, the judge told the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to behave inappropriately. The defendant then shouted a threat at the child. At that point, the court ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom. When the child finished testifying, subject to full cross-examination by defense counsel, the defendant was allowed back into the courtroom. The trial concluded, and the jury convicted the defendant. The defendant appealed the conviction, challenging only his exclusion from the courtroom. Should the court of appeals reverse the conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The defendant objects to the roommate\u2019s testimony. Is the roommate\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is improper character evidence.\nB. No, because the defendant was never convicted of the previous acts.\nC. Yes, because it is probative of intent, and intent is an element of the charged crime.\nD. Yes, because it is probative of the defendant\u2019s knowledge about drugs.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Thus, the prior bad act is irrelevant and should be excluded. A is incorrect because the roommate\u2019s testimony is not being offered to show that the defendant is a bad person. In addition, even if it were being offered for that purpose, it would still be irrelevant to the charged offense of manufacturing methamphetamine with intent to distribute. B is correct because the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts of using cocaine are irrelevant to the charged offense of manufacturing methamphetamine with intent to distribute and will be excluded.

Answer B is incorrect. The general contractor and the subcontractor were both joined by the corporation as defendants.      That makes them codefendants under Rule 13(g). Answer C is incorrect. Even if the corporation\u2019s claim against the general contractor has been dismissed, as long as the crossclaim remains undetermined, the general contractor and the subcontractor remain in the suit for purposes of that claim. Answer D is incorrect. Rule 13(g) specifically provides that a crossclaim may include a claim that the co-party is or \u201cmay be\u201d liable for all or part of the claim asserted in the main action. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure often allow for the assertion of contingent claims to avoid multiple lawsuits and encourage resolution of the entire controversy among the parties with a minimum of procedural steps.",

B is incorrect.

C is incorrect. While the extension of time to complete discovery may facilitate settlement, the court is not likely to grant the motion solely on this basis. D is correct.

Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect.

The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

B is correct. Here, the attorney\u2019s argument will be that he has a reasonable excuse for failing to appear and that the court should grant him an extension of time, much like the arguments a litigant makes when seeking relief from a default judgment under Federal Rule 60. C is incorrect. A default judgment is valid if the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant and the defendant is duly served with the summons and complaint.

An interlocutory appeal of a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is only available for a claim or issue that is separate and distinct from any other claim or issue in the case. C is incorrect. Plain errors that affect a substantial right may be corrected on an appeal after the final judgment, even if the error is not brought to the court\u2019s attention until after the entry of the final judgment. D is incorrect. The employees do not have an absolute right to an interlocutory appeal. There must be a significant case or controversy, and the order must be an interlocutory order, and the potential errors must be errors that affect a substantial right. Here, the grant of summary judgment is an interlocutory order, and the denial of the employees\u2019 motion for summary judgment would affect their substantial rights, so an interlocutory appeal would be appropriate if the other requirements are met."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

However, a final judgment is entered automatically when a timely filed appeal is taken from a judgment that is otherwise appealable. Therefore, the mere filing of the appeal operates as an entry of a final judgment. B is incorrect. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a), the court of appeals does have appellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal because the district court\u2019s order is an order that \u201crefuses an application for a injunction or refuses to dissolve an injunction\u201d and that \u201cgrants or refuses an injunction on an interlocutory appeal.\u201d C is incorrect. Although an interlocutory appeal may be taken from an order refusing an injunction, the appellate court has discretion whether to hear such an appeal. D is correct. Here, the district court\u2019s order refusing to grant an injunction is an interlocutory order, and the scientist\u2019s timely filed appeal means that the order is deemed a final judgment for purposes of appeal.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As the state-law claim remains to be decided in the action, there is not yet a final judgment on the merits of the entire action, and thus an appeal is not allowed under the final judgment rule. Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Answer C is incorrect. To obtain a discretionary interlocutory appeal, the party seeking to appeal must apply to both the district and appellate courts to meet the statutory standards. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Because the scientist has appealed without attempting to satisfy that requirement, the appeal cannot be treated as a discretionary interlocutory appeal. Answer D is incorrect. Under the final judgment rule, a judgment is not final until all the claims in the action have been resolved. While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC. Yes, because acceleration is required before a foreclosure action can be initiated.\nD.

Therefore, where the owner cured the default by reinstating the policy, the lender lost its right to accelerate. A is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the owner tendered the amount of the delinquent payment to the lender after the acceleration. By the time the owner tendered the payment, the lender no longer had the right to accept it. C is incorrect. Acceleration is not a condition precedent to a foreclosure action. D is incorrect. The lapse in insurance did not constitute a material default under the mortgage.

While typically triggered by nonpayment of the mortgage debt, they can also be triggered by the mortgagor\u2019s failure to satisfy other conditions in the mortgage, such as timely payment of insurance premiums. Answer A is incorrect. Once acceleration has properly occurred, the consequences cannot be avoided because the owner attempts to pay the delinquent insurance premium. Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect. The desire to bring a foreclosure action does not create a right to accelerate a mortgage. Rather, the right to accelerate depends upon whether a term of a mortgage has been breached.

An easement is a right to use another\u2019s land for a specified purpose. Although an easement is a property right, it is not inherent in land like the usual incidents of ownership (such as the right to possess, the right to exclude, and the right to alienation). Instead, an easement is a right to use another\u2019s land. Because the easement is a right to use the man\u2019s land, it can be transferred by deed. However, unlike other incidents of ownership, an easement does not need to be mentioned in the deed for the transfer to be valid. Instead, the easement will be implied in the grant unless the language of the deed indicates otherwise. In this case, the man did not state in the deed that he was granting an easement to the neighbor. However, because the neighbor\u2019s use of the easement was visible to the man, the man will have implied in the grant that he was creating an easement. Because the neighbor did not explicitly reject the implied easement, she cannot now seek to relocate it. B is incorrect. The neighbor\u2019s reason for wanting to relocate the easement is irrelevant to the neighbor\u2019s rights under the easement. Whether or not the neighbor would have sought to relocate the easement if her cabin had not been destroyed by fire is irrelevant to the neighbor\u2019s rights under the easement. Whether or not the neighbor would have sought to relocate the easement if her cabin had not been destroyed by fire is irrelevant to the neighbor\u2019s rights under the easement. Answer C is incorrect because the neighbor\u2019s use of the easement did not require any consideration to be binding. Whether or not the neighbor would have sought to relocate the easement if her cabin had not been destroyed by fire is irrelevant to the neighbor\u2019s rights under the easement. Answer D is incorrect because the neighbor\u2019s use of the easement on the west did not imprint that location on the easement.

The buyer financed the purchase, in part, with a $250,000 loan from a bank, secured by a mortgage on the house. Before the closing, the buyer\u2019s attorney advised him to purchase a standard-form, $300,000 title insurance policy naming the buyer as the insured. Because the buyer had forgotten to bring his checkbook to the closing, his son, who had accompanied him to the closing, paid the premium for him. One year later, the buyer died. Under his will, the house passed to his son. Two years later, the son was successfully sued by a previous record owner with a superior title to the house. The previous owner\u2019s claim had not been excepted in the buyer\u2019s title insurance policy through the carelessness of a title company employee. At the time of the lawsuit, the house was still subject to the bank\u2019s mortgage. The son immediately sought indemnification for the loss from the title insurance company. Is the son entitled to indemnification from the title insurance company?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the son was not named as an insured on the title policy.\nB. No, because when a mortgage remains outstanding, a title policy protects only the mortgagee from any loss.\nC. Yes, because the house passed to the son under the buyer\u2019s will.\nD.

The son is insured because he was the devisee of the house under the buyer\u2019s will. It is irrelevant that the son is not a named insured. Answer B is incorrect. A title policy protects whoever is the named insured (and heirs or devisees), whether that person is the buyer or the mortgagee. Here the buyer was the named insured. Answer D is incorrect.

The man built a home on the land that fully complied with the zoning law and moved into it. Subsequently, the man was diagnosed with a chronic debilitating disease.

His daughter offered to take care of him for the rest of his life if he would build her a small home on the westerly portion of his land. The man agreed, but because there was no way to site a home on the westerly portion of the land so that it was surrounded by two acres of vacant land, he applied to the local zoning board for a variance. Should the variance be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because hardship variances are not granted where the land is used for residential purposes.\nB.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other.

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter.

Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee.

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. It is not necessary that the trucker establish that the farmer was the proximate cause of the injury in order to bring a res ipsa loquitur claim. In addition, it is irrelevant to the determination of the propriety of a res ipsa loquitur instruction whether another party may also be responsible for the injury. B is correct. A res ipsa loquitur claim requires that a plaintiff establish that a defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care, that the defendant's conduct fell below the standard of reasonable care, and that the plaintiff was not responsible for the injury. A claim based on res ipsa loquitur is one in which a plaintiff seeks to establish liability for negligence based upon the \"learned profession\" doctrine. Under this doctrine, a plaintiff must establish that he was not responsible for the injury, that the defendant had exclusive control of the instrumentality during the relevant time, and that the injury was of a type that would ordinarily not have occurred in the absence of negligence. Here, the trucker's evidence would establish that the farmer had exclusive control of the cattle, that the cattle had escaped, and that the trucker was not responsible for the escape. In addition, it is for the jury to determine whether the escape was \"of a type that would ordinarily not have occurred in the absence of negligence.\" C is incorrect. Landowners are not strictly liable even for injuries to business invitees. In addition, the fact that cattle escaped from the pen does not necessarily mean that the farmer was negligent. D is incorrect. The jury may, but is not required to, find for the trucker based on the \"ordinary negligence\" requirement of res ipsa loquitur. Because the farmer's cattle were able to escape, however, it is possible that the jury could find for the farmer if it found that the trucker failed to exercise reasonable care in driving his truck at a high rate of speed on a dark, isolated road."

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and the trucker did not contribute to the accident, so the jury is permitted to conclude that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. Answer A is incorrect. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and since the trucker did not contribute to the accident, the jury can infer that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect. The trucker needs to establish that the farmer was in exclusive control of the pen, that the accident would not have occurred but for negligence, and that the accident was not due to the trucker\u2019s own actions. Answer C is incorrect. Strict liability does not attach to raising cattle, which is not an abnormally dangerous activity.",

The rupture resulted from a defect in the tire that existed at the time it was sold by the manufacturer to a retailer, who sold it to the driver and installed it on her car. The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year. After discovering this memorandum, the driver\u2019s attorney filed a timely amended complaint, adding a claim for battery. The manufacturer has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the battery claim, based on the undisputed facts set out above. If no additional facts are provided to the court concerning the risk of tire rupture, should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care to prevent ruptures.\nB.

            "explanation": "A is correct. A battery consists of the unlawful application of force to the person resulting in bodily injury or offensive touching, without consent or privilege. Battery is a general intent crime, and the force need not be applied directly. Here, the manufacturer would be held responsible for the harm to the driver if it could be shown that the manufacturer placed a defective tire into the stream of commerce with knowledge that it would harm or offend a reasonable person. Because a reasonable jury could find that the manufacturer did not take reasonable care to prevent the defect that caused the harm, the court should deny the manufacturer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. B is incorrect. B is a correct statement of the battery requirement, but it is irrelevant in this case because a reasonable jury could find that the manufacturer had exercised reasonable care in designing and manufacturing the tires. C is incorrect. It is unclear from the question whether the driver is seeking to recover for the harm to her person or for the harm to her property. If it is the former, then a strict products liability claim is available, and the battery claim would be inconsistent with it. However, if the driver is seeking recovery for the harm to her car, then a strict products liability claim would be inconsistent with a negligence claim, but not with a battery claim. D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The driver might have a valid strict products liability claim against the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support a finding\u2014required for battery liability\u2014that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect.

A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a finished product by the product\u2019s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the component is what rendered the finished product defective.

In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability.

The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met).

The father\u2019s threat to harm the bus driver was an assault, which is a battery if the threat is accompanied by an intent to carry it out and the victim reasonably believes it will be carried out. An assault is a general intent crime, and the intent to commit a battery can be proved by having the defendant engage in the assaultive conduct, or by having the defendant make a threat that is communicated to the victim and that causes the victim reasonably to fear for her safety. Battery is a general intent crime that requires that the defendant commit an assault and then bring about harmful or offensive contact with the victim. C is incorrect. IIED is a general intent tort that requires that the defendant\u2019s intentional conduct cause severe emotional distress in the victim. The father\u2019s threatening language was communicated to the bus driver and did cause her to suffer emotional distress, but this is not enough for IIED because the bus driver did not have a reason to fear that the father would actually harm her. D is incorrect. Trespass to chattels is a specific intent crime that requires that the defendant intentionally use a deadly weapon to damage the victim\u2019s property. The father\u2019s threatening language was communicated to the bus driver and did cause her emotional distress, but this is not enough for trespass to chattels because the bus driver did not have a reason to fear that the father would actually harm her."

A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver. Even under the \u201cextended personality\u201d doctrine\u2014which, for example, allows a battery plaintiff to establish the necessary contact element if the defendant touches an article of clothing the plaintiff is wearing\u2014making contact with the bus is almost certain not to count as contacting the driver\u2019s person. Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect. The driver is not likely to be considered to have a possessory interest in the damaged bus, and therefore trespass to chattels would not be a viable claim.",

Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

The farmer did not communicate with the manufacturer of the milking system or any of its agents before purchasing the system. The distributor knew that the farmer had several lucrative contracts with milk wholesalers, but the manufacturer was unaware of these contracts. The system never operated properly because of a manufacturing defect, and as a result the dairy farmer lost much of the wholesale contract revenue. Does the farmer have a viable strict products liability claim against the manufacturer for recovery of his lost revenue?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because of the economic loss doctrine.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was not aware of the farmer\u2019s wholesale contracts.\nC. Yes, because the consequential damages rule of contract law does not apply in a products liability action in which the product was in fact defective.\nD. Yes, because the milking system\u2019s defect proximately caused the farmer\u2019s loss of revenue.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Instead, the plaintiff must simply show that there was a defect in the product and that the defect caused the plaintiff's injury. In this case, the farmer's strict products liability claim against the manufacturer is viable because the defect in the milking system was unanticipated and not the fault of the farmer. The manufacturer is responsible for the defect, and the defect caused the farmer to lose revenue. Thus, D is correct, and A, B, and C are incorrect."

In this case, the only harm suffered by the farmer was lost revenue, and strict products liability does not apply when a defective product causes only economic loss, as opposed to personal injury or property damage. Answer B is incorrect. The problem is not the manufacturer\u2019s lack of knowledge about the farmer\u2019s contracts but the rule that prevents an injured party from recovering for purely economic loss caused by a defective product. Answer C is incorrect. The statement is true, but it does not entitle the farmer to damages. The contract law rule of consequential damages is irrelevant to the resolution of a tort claim.

No, because there is no indication that the manufacturer was negligent.\nC. Yes, because a new RV will not spontaneously catch fire in the absence of negligence by its manufacturer.\nD.

            "explanation": "C is correct. A strict products liability claim will lie for defects that cause harm to the plaintiff, but not for harm to other property. Here, the RV was completely destroyed by the fire, so it is clear that the couple suffered harm. It is also clear that the manufacturer was not negligent in the way that it built the RV, because if it had been, the couple would have suffered less damage and would have had personal property remaining in the RV. Thus, A, B, and D are incorrect. D is the most egregious of these incorrect answers. A is incorrect because the couple did not need to have personal property in the RV before the fire occurred for the couple to have a valid products liability claim. B is incorrect because it is possible that the manufacturer was negligent and simply did not act with the appropriate level of care in designing or building the RV. C is correct because it is the only answer that properly distinguishes between a defect that only caused harm to the RV and one that also caused harm to the couple. D is incorrect because it is overly broad. It states that the manufacturer is strictly liable for the defect without providing any justification for that conclusion."

Under the sponsorship agreement, the dealership was required to arrange for licensed and trained emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to be present during the race. The dealership contracted with a licensed and reputable emergency medical services (EMS) firm that supplied EMTs for events such as these. A motorcyclist participating in the race was injured when he lost control of his motorcycle. The motorcyclist was treated at the scene by the EMTs. In removing the motorcyclist\u2019s helmet, one of the EMTs twisted the motorcyclist\u2019s neck, causing him to become permanently paralyzed. The motorcyclist has sued both the EMS firm and the dealership, alleging that the EMT\u2019s careless conduct caused his paralysis. Assuming the validity of the motorcyclist\u2019s negligence claim against the EMS firm, which of the following best characterizes the dealership\u2019s potential liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The dealership is directly liable for hiring the EMS firm.\nB. The dealership is vicariously liable, because it owed a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care for the race.\nC.

            "explanation": "B is correct. A business hires an independent contractor to perform specialized services is normally only liable for negligence in hiring if the business has special skills or expertise which the contractor needs to perform the work. However, if the business places special duties upon the contractor, or if the contractor is performing a service which the business should reasonably expect to cause harm to others, the business may be liable for the contractor's negligent performance. In this case, the dealership placed a nondelegable duty upon the EMS firm to provide emergency medical care for the race participants. Because the EMTs were negligent in their care of the motorcyclist, this suggests that the dealership may also be responsible for their actions. A is incorrect. The dealership is not directly liable for hiring the EMS firm because the dealership likely would only be liable for negligent hiring if the dealership had special skills or expertise which the contractor needed to perform the work. C is incorrect. The dealership is not vicariously liable simply because the EMT was careless. D is incorrect. The dealership may be liable for the EMT's negligence either directly or vicariously."

Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is also no basis for direct liability.
