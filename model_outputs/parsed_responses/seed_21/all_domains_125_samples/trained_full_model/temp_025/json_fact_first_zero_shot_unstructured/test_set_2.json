Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": " The state law at issue in this question is a regulatory law, not a law that takes property for public use. And, because it is a regulatory law, it will be subject to rational basis review, which would uphold the law if there is a rational basis for it. In this case, it is rational for the state to believe that the confusion and expense that results from having to include so many heirs in oil and gas extraction contracts detracts from the state's ability to foster oil and gas resource development. Thus, the law is constitutional."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

There is no rational basis for this classification. A is incorrect because rational basis is not the test for this classification. B is incorrect because the government is not substantially burdening the owner's right of expression or association. The government is not limiting what the owner can say or do. Rather, the government is limiting the economic benefits that the owner can receive because of what he has said or done.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

The Fourteenth Amendment's privileges and immunities clause supports the federal bankruptcy amendment because it only prohibits states from treating out-of-state residents differently than state residents. The amendment does not do that. A is incorrect because the commerce clause does not prohibit Congress from enacting legislation that has a rational relationship to a legitimate federal interest. B is incorrect because Congress can commandeer a state legislature to enact legislation if the legislation is designed to serve a compelling federal interest.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss. While the city\u2019s motion was pending, the city council passed an emergency ordinance requiring both prior notice and property owner consent before the removal or replacement of any electric meter.

Here, the injury is not one that can be redressed by a claim for money damages because the injury is not one that is particular to the homeowner. That is because the city\u2019s actions in replacing the meters do not infringe upon a property right that the homeowner can vindicate through a claim for money damages. B is incorrect. The voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct does not make the case moot because the homeowner sought an injunction against the city\u2019s future actions. C is incorrect. The case is not moot because the homeowner sought an injunction against the city\u2019s future actions. D is correct.

Answer A is incorrect. \u201cCapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d applies only in situations where litigation is unlikely to be completed because of the short-term nature of an issue, such as review of an explicitly short-term legal mandate. Answer B is incorrect. The voluntary cessation exception does not apply when it is unreasonable to expect that the allegedly unlawful conduct will recur.

Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

            "explanation": " The city's ordinance is unconstitutional because it is overly broad. The ordinance bans \"all First Amendment activities,\" which would include expressive activities protected by the free speech clause of the First Amendment. Because the ordinance is written so broadly that it would prohibit protected speech, it is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect because the ordinance does not amount to a prior restraint on speech. A prior restraint is an action by the government that prohibits the communication of a message before the communication takes place. Here, the ordinance does not prohibit the communication of a message. Instead, it prohibits the gathering of people for the purpose of communicating a message. Thus, it is not a prior restraint. Answer C is incorrect because the beach cannot be considered a public forum. A public forum is an area where the government has purposefully opened the land for expressive activity. Here, the government did not open the beach for expressive activity. Instead, the swimmers were able to use the beach before the demonstrators took it over. After the demonstration ended, the city enacted an ordinance that banned \"all First Amendment activities.\" Thus, the beach was not a public forum because the government did not purposefully open the land for expressive activity. Answer D is incorrect because the government may not enact an ordinance to protect against the content of the speech. The government may only limit the time, place, and manner of speech if the restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Here, the government's interest in preventing further protests is not compelling because the demonstrators were allowed to use the beach before the ordinance was enacted. Thus, the restrictions on speech are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest."

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect.

Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect.

That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed.

In this situation, the doctrine of transferred intent applies to hold him liable for the intentional killing of the officer. Answer A is incorrect. To be guilty of capital murder, the man would need to have acted with the intent to kill a police      officer. Answer C is incorrect because the man acted with premeditation and malice. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, the man is therefore guilty of the more serious offense of first-degree murder. Answer D is incorrect because the question asks for the most serious crime.

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

Using an online directory that the resident had joined, the police obtained the resident\u2019s cell- phone number. The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB. No, because the subpoena was based on a cell- phone number that the resident had voluntarily placed in the public domain.\nC. Yes, because a subpoena must be based on probable cause.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the state. This protection extends to electronic communications and data. However, the Fourth Amendment does not protect information that a person has voluntarily disclosed to a third party. Here, the defendant placed his cell phone number into an online directory, which is publicly available information. Because the number was available to the public, police did not need a warrant to obtain it, and their subpoena of the cell-phone provider for a year's worth of historical data was not a search under the Fourth Amendment. A is incorrect. The expectation of privacy must be reasonable, and the fact that information was shared with a third party does not, on its own, make the expectation unreasonable. However, as stated above, the Fourth Amendment does not protect information that a person has voluntarily disclosed to a third party. C is incorrect. A subpoena does not need to be based on probable cause when the information being sought is not subject to Fourth Amendment protection. Here, because the cell-phone number was not obtained through a warrantless search, the subpoena did not need to be based on probable cause. D is incorrect. The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the state. This protection extends to electronic communications and data.

Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

In this case, the woman did not use a weapon or dangerous implement, but rather used her shotgun to defend her property. However, the woman's use of the shotgun to defend her property qualifies as aggravated assault because it was an offensive or threatening use of the weapon or dangerous implement. The woman's defense to the charge of aggravated assault is that she was acting in self-defense. In order to succeed in her defense, the woman must show that the defensive use of the shotgun was necessary to protect her from the imminent use of unlawful force. The court should give the jury the instruction on self-defense that requires the jury to find: 1) the defendant believed that the action taken was necessary to prevent the unlawful force from occurring; and 2) the belief that the unlawful force was imminent and necessary to protect the defendant from it. The instruction that the woman's attorney is seeking is a correct statement of the law and should be given to the jury. A is incorrect. The majority of states that recognize a right to stand one's ground rather than retreat limit the right to an owner who is confronted in his home by an intruder. In this case, the woman was not in her home and, even if she were, the majority of states would not require her to retreat before using deadly force. B is incorrect. The majority of states do not have a specific statute prohibiting the use of deadly force to protect property. In such jurisdictions, the defendant would be required to show that the force was necessary to protect the defendant from the imminent use of unlawful force. C is incorrect.

However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing.

When a jury is discharged from its duty without agreeing upon a verdict, the court may order a new trial if it appears that the jury has been impaired in its function by the influence of extraneous matters. Here, the jury was instructed to also consider the lesser included offense of second-degree murder. When the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the lesser offense of second-degree murder, the court should have determined whether the jury was impaired in its function by the influence of extraneous matters and, if so, order a new trial on the first-degree murder charge. Because the jury was not impaired in its function and did in fact return a verdict on the second-degree murder charge, the court should not order a new trial on the first-degree murder charge. A is incorrect. The jury's verdict of guilty to the lesser included offense of second-degree murder does not constitute an acquittal of the defendant of first-degree murder. In addition, even if the jury did \"effectively\" acquit the defendant of first-degree murder, a new trial would still be proper because the jury was impaired in its function by the influence of extraneous matters and, as stated above, a new trial would be ordered if that were so. B is incorrect. The vindictive-prosecution doctrine does not preclude a state from prosecuting a defendant for the same offense after the defendant has been acquitted or convicted and then successfully appealed the conviction or acquittal. Here, the defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, and then successfully appealed the conviction on an unrelated evidentiary ground. Because the defendant was not acquitted of the charge, and was not punished for taking the appeal, the vindictive-prosecution doctrine does not apply. C is incorrect. It is the defendant who bears the burden of persuasion in a motion for a new trial on the ground of jury impairment, and the defendant cannot establish the necessary impairment by simply showing that the jury was instructed to consider a lesser included offense. In addition, it is the prosecution that must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the charged crime, not the other way around. Therefore, even if the defendant sought a lesser included offense instruction, it does not establish the necessary precondition for a new trial on the ground of jury impairment."

Three witnesses testified for the state that the defendant approached the victim in a bar, engaged in a brief conversation with him, and then, without warning, drew a gun and shot the victim in the stomach. One witness for the state testified that just before the defendant drew his gun and shot the victim, the victim twice kicked the defendant in the groin. The state\u2019s evidence clearly established that the victim died as a result of the gunshot wound. The defendant did not testify or offer any evidence. The defendant requested that the jury be instructed on voluntary manslaughter based upon heat of passion from adequate provocation. The state argued that murder should be the only form of homicide submitted. Should the court instruct on voluntary manslaughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant did not meet his burden of producing evidence of heat of passion from adequate provocation.\nB. No, because the weight of the evidence indicated that the victim did nothing amounting to adequate provocation.\nC.

Even      though it is a single witness who recounts this event, a jury can credit a single witness\u2019s testimony. Answer A is incorrect because the state offered evidence of a serious battery on the defendant, which can constitute an adequate provocation, no matter which party presented the evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the judge\u2019s job is not to weigh the evidence but is only to determine whether a reasonable jury could find adequate provocation. The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis. For instance, if there were no evidence of provocation, but the defense sought a manslaughter instruction, such an instruction should be denied.",

After trial, defense counsel learned that the prosecution had failed to disclose that the key witness against the defendant had previously been convicted of perjury in another case. The defense filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court rejected the defense argument and upheld the conviction because state discovery rules did not require the disclosure. The defendant then filed an appeal, arguing that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose this prior perjury conviction had violated his federal constitutional rights. Can the state appellate court overturn the conviction based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the witness\u2019s prior perjury conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery is regulated by state rather than federal procedure.\nB. No, because the prior conviction was mere impeachment rather than evidence of actual innocence.\nC.

Answer A is incorrect because, although generally discovery is governed by state rules, the due process clause contains some core rights, such as the right to disclosure of critical exculpatory evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the scope of due process is not limited to proof of actual innocence. The government must disclose any evidence favorable to the defendant that could affect the outcome of the case. Answer D is incorrect because the due process clause requires disclosure only if the evidence is significant enough to affect the outcome.

Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on direct appeal.

Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, \u201cpenalized\u201d by an attorney\u2019s failure to object.

After determining that other subcontractors would charge at least $18,000 for the work, the general contractor agreed in writing. When the work was completed, the general contractor tendered the subcontractor $12,000. The subcontractor refused to accept the payment. If the subcontractor prevails in a suit against the general contractor, how much will the subcontractor be likely to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $12,000, because the contract modification was not supported by consideration.\nB. $12,000, because the subcontractor\u2019s mistake was unilateral.\nC. $15,000, because the contract modification was fair and equitable under the circumstances.\nD. $18,000, because that is the value of the benefit the subcontractor conferred on the general contractor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "C is correct. A unilateral mistake of fact may be considered a constructive condition precedent to the duty of the obligation that the mistake concerned. If the subcontractor's mistake of fact relates to a constructive condition precedent, the failure to satisfy the condition will excuse the obligation of the contract. In this case, the subcontractor's mistake related to the amount of work required to perform the contract, which is a constructive condition precedent to the subcontractor's duty to perform. When the subcontractor discovered the mistake, she informed the general contractor and requested a time extension to allow her to perform the contract according to its terms. The general contractor refused to grant an extension and instead proposed a contract modification that would have the subcontractor perform the same amount of work for $15,000. The subcontractor refused to perform under the contract modification and sought to avoid it on the ground that it was not supported by consideration. However, the subcontractor's mistake related to a constructive condition precedent, which excused her obligation to perform. Therefore, the subcontractor was not bound by the contract modification and will recover $18,000, the reasonable value of her services. A is incorrect. Consideration is not required to support a unilateral mistake of fact that relates to a constructive condition precedent. B is incorrect. The general contractor's refusal to grant an extension to the subcontractor when she sought one does not justify the subcontractor in performing under a contract that is not supported by consideration. D is incorrect. The value of the benefit conferred on the general contractor is irrelevant to the determination of what the subcontractor is entitled to recover. The subcontractor is entitled to recover $18,000 because the contract modification was not supported by consideration, and the subcontractor's mistake related to a constructive condition precedent."

Subject to the man\u2019s claim for damages for breach, how much is the contractor likely to recover for the work he performed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $50,000, on a theory of reliance.\nB. $60,000, on a theory of divisible contract.\nC. The value of the benefit conferred, on a theory of restitution.\nD. Nothing, because the contractor\u2019s breach was willful.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. A party that materially breaches a contract is nevertheless entitled to recover under a theory of restitution the amount of the value of the benefit that the breaching party\u2019s part performance conferred on the victim of the breach. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374. Answer A is incorrect. A breaching party cannot recover on a theory of reliance. Answer B is incorrect. This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 240. Answer D is incorrect. Contract law generally does not distinguish between willful breaches and other breaches. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374; Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 12.3. This situation would not require a court to consider the reason for breach.",

If a buyer repudiates a contract for unfinished goods, the seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment proceed in any reasonable manner, including finishing the goods for resale. UCC \u00a7 2- 704(2). The seller\u2019s damages in that situation are the difference between the contract price and the resale price. UCC \u00a7 2- 706(1). Here that amount is $8,000. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale. Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale rather than seeking costs and lost profit. Note that this has the effect of reducing the seller\u2019s damages.      Answer D is incorrect. In the common law case of Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co., 35 F.2d 301 (4th Cir. 1929), the court held that the seller had a duty not to complete a bridge after the buyer repudiated.

Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury. Answer B is incorrect. To constitute habit evidence, an organization\u2019s practice need not be \u201cautomatic\u201d but only routine\u2014something that is regularly done. The supervisor\u2019s testimony here is that the agents\u2019 regular practice is to discuss supplemental policy options with customers. Answer C is incorrect. Character evidence is not admissible in civil cases to prove conduct. See FRE 404(a) and (b). This evidence is admissible only if it is habit evidence\u2014evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice\u2014under FRE 406.",

One trial witness was a child who had seen one of the killings. Before calling the child to testify, the prosecution moved to remove the defendant from the courtroom, arguing that the child would be intimidated by seeing the defendant. The court denied the motion. When the child entered the courtroom to testify, the defendant became unruly, moving as though he was about to lunge from his chair toward the child. The judge warned the defendant to stop the behavior. After a second warning, the judge told the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to behave inappropriately. The defendant then shouted a threat at the child. At that point, the court ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom. When the child finished testifying, subject to full cross-examination by defense counsel, the defendant was allowed back into the courtroom. The trial concluded, and the jury convicted the defendant. The defendant appealed the conviction, challenging only his exclusion from the courtroom. Should the court of appeals reverse the conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a defendant may be excluded from the courtroom to protect a minor witness from further trauma.\nB. No, because the right to be present can be forfeited by disruptive behavior.\nC.

As explained above, under FRE 704(b), an expert in a criminal case may not state an opinion about whether a defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. Thus, the first part of the psychiatrist\u2019s proposed testimony is admissible, as it will be helpful to the jury, but the second part is not. Answer B is incorrect. FRE 704(b)\u2019s prohibition on expert testimony about a defendant\u2019s mental state applies to both parties\u2019 experts in a criminal case. Answer D is incorrect. An expert may testify that a defendant suffered from schizophrenia but may not testify that the defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. The latter testimony is barred by FRE 704(b).",

The court, on its own initiative, ordered the attorney to show cause why the attorney should not be sanctioned under Rule 11. Would sanctions against the attorney be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) requires that factual contentions presented by an attorney to the court have evidentiary support. Attorneys may rely on affidavits and documents provided by their clients unless the circumstances suggest that it would be unreasonable to do so or that further inquiry is needed. Answer A is incorrect. The \u201csafe harbor\u201d requirement in Rule 11 applies only when a party moves for sanctions, not when the court acts on its own initiative. Answer C is incorrect. Under Rule 11(b), attorneys certify that factual contentions they present to the court have evidentiary support, not that they are true. As indicated above, there is nothing in the facts suggesting that the attorney should have questioned either the signed covenant or the president\u2019s affidavit as containing false information. Answer D is incorrect. There is no general rule requiring attorneys to verify signatures on documents before presenting them to a court. Rather, the inquiry under Rule 11(b) is whether the attorney acted to the best of the attorney\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry under the circumstances.

There is no authority under Rule 13(g) to allow an attempt to assert a defense against the plaintiff so as to shift direct liability for damages owed to the plaintiff to a codefendant. Answer B is incorrect. The general contractor and the subcontractor were both joined by the corporation as defendants.      That makes them codefendants under Rule 13(g). Answer C is incorrect. Even if the corporation\u2019s claim against the general contractor has been dismissed, as long as the crossclaim remains undetermined, the general contractor and the subcontractor remain in the suit for purposes of that claim.

Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond.

The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect.

In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial.

Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim.

While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

The grantee of the land is bound by the restrictions, but the grantor of the land is still bound by the restrictions as well. In this case, the facts indicate that the man, the original grantee, has promised that a restriction will be included in any deeds he conveys in the future. Therefore, the man is still bound by the restriction, and his promise to include a restriction in any deeds he conveys in the future is enforceable against him. The issue is whether the entrepreneur, the subsequent grantee, is also bound by the restriction. To determine whether an obligation is enforceable against a subsequent grantee, it is necessary to determine whether the subsequent grantee had notice of the restriction. In this case, the facts indicate that the entrepreneur had no actual notice of the man's promise to the woman to include a restriction in any deeds to the easterly tract of land. However, the facts do not indicate that the entrepreneur had inquiry notice of the restriction. Inquiry notice is not sufficient, because it indicates only that the subsequent grantee had a suspicion that there might be a restriction on the land. To have actual notice, the subsequent grantee must have been told of the existence of the restriction. Therefore, answer B is correct. A is incorrect because the type of index system used in the jurisdiction will not be relevant to determining whether a grantee is bound by a restriction. C is incorrect because whether the entrepreneur had a duty to search the title is irrelevant if the subsequent grantee had no actual notice of the restriction.

The contract was silent as to the condition of the property, but the seller's communication that he was selling the property \"as is\" created a rebuttable presumption that the seller had no knowledge of the condition of the property. The buyer's decision to not inspect the property despite the seller's statement that he was selling \"as is\" and the buyer's own statement that she was an experienced land buyer, constituted an acceptance of the risk. Therefore, the buyer assumed the risk and will not recover for the damage to the property. A is incorrect. The UCC controls for a sale of goods transaction, and this is a contract for the sale of land. B is incorrect. The fact that the deed was warranty does not change the fact that the buyer assumed the risk and will not recover for the damage to the property. D is incorrect.

The seller asked the buyer whether she wanted to inspect the property, but the buyer declined.

A court will enforce an \u201cas is\u201d clause in residential sales as long as there is no positive misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment, neither of which is present in these facts. Answer B is incorrect. A warranty deed provides protection for title issues, not issues of physical condition. Answer D is incorrect. The merger doctrine is irrelevant. Under that doctrine, acceptance of the warranty deed extinguishes all contractual promises of the seller relating to the quality of title. Here, the suit is about the condition of the residence, not its title. The \u201cas is\u201d clause extinguishes claims based upon termites, as that clause eliminates any contractual duty of the seller to deliver a residence free of termites.",

            "explanation": "D is correct. The only requirements that must be met for a conveyance of land to be valid (and thereby transfer legal title from one party to another) are execution and delivery of the deed. The execution requirement is satisfied as long as the deed is signed by the party to be charged (the seller). Delivery of a deed is established by a proven intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. In this case, there is no dispute as to the seller's execution of the deed (because the deed was signed by the father), but the title document was not delivered to the grantee (the son) because it was the son who obtained his father's signature on it. The only issue is whether the son's execution of the deed to himself raises any issues as to its validity. The only way a conveyance of land can be rendered void is if the grantee's execution of the deed can be proven. In this case, the grantee's execution of the deed can be proven, because the grantee (the son) was the one who obtained his father's (the grantor's) signature on the deed. Therefore, the deed is void, and answer D is correct. A is incorrect. The grantee's execution of the deed is what makes it void, not the grantor's actual signature on it. B is incorrect. The grantee's execution of the deed is what makes it void, not the fact that the investor was an innocent purchaser. C is incorrect. The grantee's execution of the deed is what makes it void, not the fact that the will was executed before the deed was delivered."

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other. Which party is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because a default will be implied by the court under these facts.\nB.

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter.

Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Res ipsa loquitur is an inference of negligence against a defendant based on the plaintiff's right to have the use of his or her property, and the fact that that use has been interrupted by an unnatural, unreasonable use of that property by the defendant. The doctrine is generally applied in situations where negligence clearly occurred, but the defendant has not breached a duty owed to the plaintiff. In such cases, the plaintiff has the burden of showing negligence, and may do so by showing that the defendant had exclusive control of the instrumentality during the time that injury occurred, and that the injury would not ordinarily occur in the absence of the defendant's negligence. The farmer's introduction of evidence that his pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail, suggests that the farmer was not negligent in his use of the cattle pen. The jury could certainly find that the escape was not the result of negligence on the farmer's part, and that the injury would not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence. Therefore, the court should not give the res ipsa loquitur instruction to the jury. A is incorrect. The third party could be responsible for the injury, but this would not be a defense for the farmer to assert. If the farmer were to assert this defense, it would be an affirmative defense, which shifts the burden to the farmer to prove that the third party was responsible for the injury. The farmer has not been charged with any wrongdoing, and thus has no burden to prove anything. B is incorrect. The trucker does not need to show negligence by the farmer with regard to the construction of the pen. Whether the pen was constructed in a negligent manner is irrelevant to the issue of whether the farmer was negligent in his use of the pen. C is incorrect. The farmer is not strictly liable for harm caused by his escaping cattle. Strict liability is a theory of liability that allows a plaintiff to recover for harm caused by a dangerous or abnormally dangerous activity or use of a product, without proof of negligence. The escape of the cattle would not qualify as a dangerous or abnormally dangerous activity, as it is a normal use of the land that just happened to cause harm in this instance. The farmer is not strictly liable for the escape of his cattle."

Answer A is incorrect. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and since the trucker did not contribute to the accident, the jury can infer that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect.

Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture.

In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer A is incorrect. The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met). Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer D is incorrect. The mere knowledge that the sand needed to be properly mixed with water and cement to make sound concrete is not sufficient to render the distributor liable for an injury caused by the defective concrete.",

The doctor can implead the grocery store, because the fact-finder could find that the negligence of both the grocery store and the doctor contributed to the total injury suffered by the shopper, including the worsening of her injury resulting most immediately from the doctor\u2019s malpractice. Answer A is incorrect. The question is not about the standard of care applicable to the doctor and the store, but rather whether the store, if found negligent, can be held responsible along with the doctor not only for the shopper\u2019s initial injury but also for the worsening of the injury as a result of the doctor\u2019s malpractice. Answer B is incorrect. The mere fact that the doctor\u2019s malpractice happened after any possible negligence on the part of the store does not defeat the imposition of liability on the store for the worsening of the shopper\u2019s injury caused by the doctor\u2019s malpractice.

The fact that the doctor\u2019s negligence and the store\u2019s negligence (if any) both contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s injury provides a basis for why the doctor can implead the grocery store.",

A is incorrect. The company did not need to expressly authorize the security officer's acts for the company to be responsible for the officer's tortious behavior.

Intrusion upon seclusion is one of the four privacy torts recognized by the Second Restatement of Torts and most states. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A\u2013E (1977). Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the company did not expressly authorize the security officer\u2019s specific actions does not necessarily allow it to avoid liability. The security officer was an employee of the company, and the company both directed the officer to investigate the woman and provided the officer with her phone number. On this basis, a jury could reasonably hold the company liable based on the officer\u2019s actions. Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s breach of the noncompetition agreement, if any, would not prevent a reasonable jury from concluding that the company is liable to the woman for intrusion upon seclusion. Whether the company has a cause of action against the woman for breach of the agreement is a separate question. Answer C is incorrect.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The father's threatening language and actions constituted a battery against the bus driver because there was an intentional (with malice) harmful or offensive contact. The actual touching need not be done personally by the defendant as long as the defendant set into motion an action with purpose or knowledge to a substantial certainty that the offensive or harmful touching would result. In this case, the father's actions scared the bus driver, and, because he knew that his actions would be offensive and would cause harm, he committed a battery. A is incorrect. An assault is an attempt to commit a criminal battery. Here, the father did not attempt to commit a criminal unlawful touching of the bus driver. He threatened to commit a criminal unlawful touching, but did not commit the crime of assault because there was no attempt to commit a criminal unlawful touching. C is incorrect. The bus driver's claim does not state a prima facie case for IIED because the father did not act with the intent to cause emotional distress. D is incorrect. Trespass to chattels is a general claim for damage to a person's property. Here, the issue is not damage to the bus, but rather the harm to the bus driver's emotional well-being."

A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver.

Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. The manufacturer affirmatively misrepresented a material fact when it falsely stated that it had no plan in place to cease doing business in State A. Answer D is incorrect. This answer points to a fact\u2014the manufacturer\u2019s reservation of a right to do business with other distributors\u2014that is irrelevant to the question of whether the manufacturer is subject to liability for fraud.",

The packaging indicated that the pills were \u201ccoated\u201d but did not list the ingredients in the coating. A few days after she bought the medication, because the daughter was in extreme pain, the mother gave the daughter three times the recommended dose of the medication. Thirty minutes later, because the daughter had a very rare allergy to an ingredient in the coating, she had a severe allergic reaction, for which she was hospitalized. The mother was aware of the daughter\u2019s allergy, but she did not know that the medication contained the ingredient to which the daughter was allergic. In a failure-to-warn action brought against the manufacturer of the medication, which of the arguments below would be the LEAST promising as a defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter\u2019s allergy to the ingredient in the coating was very rare.\nB. The manufacturer\u2019s duty was to warn learned intermediaries, not consumers of the medication.\nC. The mother should not have given her daughter a triple dose of the medication.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The call of the question is a failure-to-warn claim, which is a warning-based negligence claim. The manufacturer had a duty to warn the mother of the risks of taking the medication, which would be satisfied by providing a warning on the label of the medication. The mother, aware of her daughter's allergy, would have been able to determine whether the medication was safe for her to take. A is incorrect. The rarity of the daughter's allergy is irrelevant to the merits of the failure-to-warn claim. B is incorrect. The manufacturer's duty would be to warn the ultimate consumer (the mother), not just learned intermediaries. C is incorrect. The mother's actions in giving her daughter a triple dose of the medication would not provide a defense for the manufacturer in a failure-to-warn claim. The manufacturer would still be required to warn the mother of the risks of taking the medication, and the mother would be entitled to rely on the warning on the label."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

The farmer did not communicate with the manufacturer of the milking system or any of its agents before purchasing the system. The distributor knew that the farmer had several lucrative contracts with milk wholesalers, but the manufacturer was unaware of these contracts. The system never operated properly because of a manufacturing defect, and as a result the dairy farmer lost much of the wholesale contract revenue. Does the farmer have a viable strict products liability claim against the manufacturer for recovery of his lost revenue?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because of the economic loss doctrine.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was not aware of the farmer\u2019s wholesale contracts.\nC. Yes, because the consequential damages rule of contract law does not apply in a products liability action in which the product was in fact defective.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Strict liability can be imposed upon the manufacturer of a defective product for the harm caused by that product to the farmer. The product was in fact defective, and the manufacturer is the proximate cause of the farmer's injury. Therefore, the farmer can recover for the loss of revenue that he sustained as a result of the malfunctioning milking system. A is incorrect. The economic loss doctrine does not bar the farmer's claim because the claim is for physical harm to the farmer's property (the milk). B is incorrect. The manufacturer had constructive knowledge of the wholesale contracts because the distributor knew of them. Constructive knowledge of the farmer's expectations is sufficient to impose a duty of care. C is incorrect. The consequential damages rule of contract law does not apply only to breach of the express terms of a contract. In addition, the application of that rule would be beside the point, because the farmer's claim is a products liability action, not a breach of contract action. The product was in fact defective, and the manufacturer is the proximate cause of the farmer's injury."

In this case, the only harm suffered by the farmer was lost revenue, and strict products liability does not apply when a defective product causes only economic loss, as opposed to personal injury or property damage. Answer B is incorrect. The problem is not the manufacturer\u2019s lack of knowledge about the farmer\u2019s contracts but the rule that prevents an injured party from recovering for purely economic loss caused by a defective product. Answer C is incorrect. The statement is true, but it does not entitle the farmer to damages. The contract law rule of consequential damages is irrelevant to the resolution of a tort claim.

            "explanation": "C is correct. Strict liability can be imposed upon the manufacturer of a defective product for the harm caused by the product, even if there was no negligence on the part of the manufacturer. To bring a products liability claim based on strict liability, a plaintiff must show that the product was in a defective condition or unreasonably dangerous to the user's expectations, and that the defective condition was a proximate cause of the harm. If a manufacturer is aware or should be aware of the danger, the product is considered unreasonably dangerous. In this case, the facts indicate that the manufacturer should have been aware of the danger, because a new RV will not spontaneously catch fire in the absence of negligence. Therefore, the manufacturer is liable for the strict products liability claim brought by the couple. A is incorrect. The couple's claim is not a negligence action, because there is no allegation of negligence on the part of the manufacturer. B is incorrect. There is an allegation of negligence on the part of the manufacturer. D is incorrect. Strict liability is not the appropriate standard in this case. In a strict liability claim, the plaintiff need only show that the product was in a defective condition or unreasonably dangerous to the user's expectations. In a negligence claim, the plaintiff must show not only that the product was in a defective condition, but also that the manufacturer was negligent."

The dealership contracted with a licensed and reputable emergency medical services (EMS) firm that supplied EMTs for events such as these. A motorcyclist participating in the race was injured when he lost control of his motorcycle. The motorcyclist was treated at the scene by the EMTs.

Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is also no basis for direct liability.
