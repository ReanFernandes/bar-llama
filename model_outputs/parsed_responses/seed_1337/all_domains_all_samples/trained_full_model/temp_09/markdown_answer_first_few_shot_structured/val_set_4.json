The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nSelf-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside. When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA federal civil statute prohibited fishing in any body of water that was located within a national park and contained a particular endangered species of fish. The statute authorized federal district courts to enjoin knowing violators of the statute from the use of all national park facilities for up to two years. After a vacationer was found by a federal district court to have knowingly violated the statute, the court issued an injunction against his use of all national park facilities for two years. The vacationer appealed. Before the appeals court heard the vacationer's case, Congress repealed the statute by a law that expressly made the repeal effective retroactive to a date one month before the vacationer's violation of the statute. The law also directly cited the vacationer's case and stated that it was intended to \"repeal all the statutory prohibitions that formed the basis for decisions\" such as that rendered against the vacationer. On the basis of this law, the vacationer has asked the appeals court to vacate the injunction issued against him. Counsel for the United States has objected, contending that, as applied to the specific case pending in the appeals court, the law is unconstitutional. How should the appeals court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. For the United States, because Congress defied the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws by\nretroactively changing the consequences for violating the statute after the violation was proved in a trial court.\nB. For the United States, because the law's citation to the vacationer's case demonstrates that Congress intended to\ncompel the appeals court to reach a particular result and, therefore, sought to exercise judicial powers vested\nexclusively in the courts by Article III.\nC. For the vacationer, because Congress has the power to determine the laws to be applied by the federal courts and to\nrequire retroactive application of those laws to any specifically identified case that it chooses.\nD. For the vacationer, because Congress is authorized to make substantive changes to federal civil statutes and to direct\nthat those changes be applied by the courts to all actions in which a final judgment has not yet been rendered.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Throughout the civil war, the ruling faction controlled the majority of the country's territory, and the United States afforded diplomatic immunity to the ambassador representing the ruling faction. A newly elected President of the United States decided to recognize a rebel group as the government of the foreign country and notified the ambassador from the ruling faction that she must leave the United States within 10 days. The ambassador filed an action in federal district court for a declaration that the ruling faction was the true government of the foreign country and for an injunction against enforcement of the President's order that she leave the United States. The United States has moved to dismiss the action. If the court dismisses the action, what will be the most likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nSelf-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside. When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA motorist who resided in State A was severely injured in a traffic accident that occurred in State B. The other vehicle involved in the accident was a truck owned by a furniture manufacturer and driven by one of its employees. The manufacturer's headquarters are in State B. Its products are sold by retailers in State A, but it has no office, plant, or agent for service of process there. The motorist brought an action against the manufacturer in a state court in State A. The manufacturer appeared specially to contest that court's jurisdiction over it. The court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the manufacturer by virtue of State A's long-arm statute. At trial, the court instructed the jury to apply State A law, under which a plaintiff's contributory negligence is a basis for reducing an award of damages but not for denying recovery altogether. Under State B law, contributory negligence is a complete defense. The jury found that the manufacturer was negligent and that its negligence was a cause of the motorist's injuries. It also found that the motorist was negligent, though to a lesser degree than the manufacturer, and that the motorist's negligence contributed to the accident. It returned a verdict in favor of the motorist and awarded her $1 million in damages. The manufacturer appealed the judgment entered on this verdict, asserting error in the court's ruling on jurisdiction and in its application of State A law instead of State B law. The manufacturer raised all federal constitutional claims pertinent to these claims of error. The highest court in State A affirmed the trial court's judgment, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied the manufacturer's petition for a writ of certiorari. The motorist has brought an action against the manufacturer in a state court in State B to collect on the judgment. The manufacturer has defended on all relevant federal constitutional grounds. How should the State B court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. For the manufacturer, because a judgment entered by a court that lacks jurisdiction over one of the parties is not\nentitled to full faith and credit, and the State A court could not constitutionally assert jurisdiction over the\nmanufacturer because of the manufacturer's lack of a presence in that state.\nB. For the manufacturer, because the State A court was bound by the full faith and credit clause to apply State B law to\nan accident that occurred in State B and in which a State B company was involved.\nC. For the motorist, because the manufacturer litigated the issues of jurisdiction and choice of law in the State A court,\nand the final judgment of that court is entitled to full faith and credit in the State B court.\nD. For the motorist, because the Supreme Court's denial of certiorari to review the judgment of the highest court in State\nA conclusively establishes that the manufacturer's federal constitutional claims are invalid.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Congress appropriated a fixed sum of money to fund loans made pursuant to the program and gave a designated federal agency discretion to decide which applicants were to receive the loans. Two weeks after the program was established, a family farmer applied to the agency for a loan. Agency officials promptly reviewed her application and summarily denied it. The farmer has sued the agency in federal district court, claiming only that the denial of her application without the opportunity for a hearing violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The farmer claims that she could have proved at such a hearing that without the federal loan it would be necessary for her to sell her farm. Should the court uphold the agency's decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because due process requires federal agencies to provide a hearing before making any factual determination that\nadversely affects an identified individual on the basis of his or her particular circumstances.\nB. No, because the denial of a loan may deprive the farmer of an established liberty interest to pursue her chosen\noccupation.\nC.

Because female students at the school considered it unfashionable to wear shorts cut at or below the knee, they no longer wore shorts to school. On the other hand, male students at the school regularly wore shorts cut at or below the knee because they considered such shorts to be fashionable. Female students sued to challenge the constitutionality of the dress code on the ground that it denied them the equal protection of the laws.

The company acquired mining equipment and began to plan its mining operations. Just as the company was about to begin mining, Congress enacted a statute that imposed a number of new environmental regulations and land-reclamation requirements on all mining operations within the United States. The statute made the company's planned mining operations economically infeasible. As a result, the company sold the tract of land to a farmer. While the sale price allowed the company to recover its original investment in the land, it did not cover the additional cost of the mining equipment the company had purchased or the profits it had expected to earn from its mining operations on the land. In an action filed against the appropriate federal official, the company claims that the statute effected a taking of its property for which it is entitled to just compensation in an amount equal to the cost of the mining equipment it purchased and the profits it expected to earn from its mining operations on the land. Which of the following is the most appropriate result in the action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The company should prevail on its claims for the cost of the mining equipment and for its lost profits.\nB.

Although PTSD is a possible result of a car accident, it is not common. Many accident victims in a particular state who received the mailings complained that the mailings were disturbing and were an invasion of their privacy. These victims also reported that as a result of the mailings, their regard for psychotherapists and for psychotherapy as a form of treatment had diminished. In response, the state enacted a law prohibiting any licensed psychotherapist from sending mailings that raised the concern of PTSD to any car accident victim in the state until 30 days after the accident. The state justified the law as an effort to address the victims' complaints as well as to protect the reputation of psychotherapy as a form of treatment. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law singles out one type of message for prohibition while allowing others.\nB. No, because the mailings provide information to consumers.\nC. Yes, because mailings suggesting the possibility of developing PTSD as the result of an accident are misleading.\nD.

Some scientific evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted from poultry to humans. Poultry farming is a major industry in several U.S. states. In one such state, the legislature has enacted a law imposing a fee of two cents per bird on all poultry farming and processing operations in the state. The purpose of the fee is to pay for a state inspection system to ensure that no poultry raised or processed in the state is infected with the virus. A company that has poultry processing plants both in the state and in other states has sued to challenge the fee. Is the fee constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because although it attaches only to intrastate activity, in the aggregate, the fee substantially affects interstate\ncommerce.\nB. No, because it places an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the negative implications of the\ncommerce clause.\nC. Yes, because it applies only to activities that take place wholly within the state, and it does not unduly burden\ninterstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because it was enacted pursuant to the state's police power, which takes precedence over the negative\nimplications of the commerce clause.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The language of the deed was sufficient to create a common law joint tenancy with right of survivorship, which is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. The woman mailed the deed to the son with a letter saying: \"Because I intend you and your wife to have my house after my death, I am enclosing a deed to the house. However, I intend to live in the house for the rest of my life, so don't record the deed until I die. The deed will be effective at my death.\" The son put the deed in his desk. The wife discovered the deed and recorded it without the son's knowledge. Subsequently, the son and the wife separated, and the wife, without telling anyone, conveyed her interest in the house to a friend who immediately reconveyed it to the wife. The woman learned that the son and the wife had separated and also learned what had happened to the deed to the house. The woman then brought an appropriate action against the son and the wife to obtain a declaration that the woman was still the owner of the house and an order canceling of record the woman's deed and the subsequent deeds. If the court determines that the woman owns the house in fee simple, what will be the likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The deed was not delivered.\nB. The wife's conduct entitles the woman to equitable relief.\nC. The woman expressly reserved a life estate.\nD. The woman received no consideration for her deed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The eastern portion of the land was undeveloped and unused. A farmer owned a farm, the western border of which was along the eastern border of the man's land. The two tracts of land had never been in common ownership. Five years ago, the farmer asked the man for permission to use a designated two acres of the eastern portion of the man's land to enlarge her farm's irrigation facilities. The man orally gave his permission for such use. Since then, the farmer has invested substantial amounts of money and effort each year to develop and maintain the irrigation facilities within the two-acre parcel. The man has been fully aware of the farmer's actions. Nothing regarding this matter was ever reduced to writing. Last year, the man gave the entire tract of land as a gift to his nephew. The deed of gift made no reference to the farmer or the two-acre parcel. When the nephew had the land surveyed and discovered the facts, he notified the farmer in writing, \"Your license to use the two-acre parcel has been terminated.\" The notice instructed the farmer to remove her facilities from the two-acre parcel immediately. The farmer refused the nephew's demand. In an appropriate action between the nephew and the farmer to determine whether the farmer had a right to continue to use the two-acre parcel, the court ruled in favor of the farmer.

Both parties complied with all lease terms. The lease is set to expire next month. Two weeks ago, when the landlord contacted the tenant about a possible lease renewal, she learned that the tenant had decided not to renew the lease, and that the tenant planned to remove all of the above-listed items on or before the lease termination date. The landlord claimed that all the items had become part of the real estate and had to remain on the premises. The tenant asserted his right and intention to remove all the items. Both the lease and the statutes of the jurisdiction are silent on the matter in dispute.

The landlord has sued the tenant to enjoin his removal of the items. How is the court likely to rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The man has never physically occupied the land. Nineteen years ago, a woman entered the farm. The character and duration of the woman's possession of the farm caused her to become the owner of the farm under the adverse possession law of the jurisdiction. Three years ago, when the woman was not present, a neighbor took over possession of the farm. The neighbor repaired fences, put up \"no trespassing\" signs, and did some plowing. When the woman returned, she found the neighbor in possession of the farm. The neighbor vigorously rejected the woman's claimed right to possession and threatened force. The woman withdrew. The woman then went to the man and told him of the history of activity on the farm. The woman orally told the man that she had been wrong to try to take his farm. She expressly waived any claim she had to the land. The man thanked her. Last month, unsure of the effect of her conversation with the man, the woman executed a deed purporting to convey the farm to her son. The son promptly recorded the deed. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Who now owns the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The promissory note stated that the businessman was not personally liable for the mortgage debt. One week later, a finance company obtained a judgment against the businessman for $50,000 and filed the judgment in the county where the real estate was located. At the time the judgment was filed, the finance company had no actual notice of the bank's mortgage. Two weeks after that filing, the bank recorded its mortgage on the businessman's real estate. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"Unless the same be recorded according to law, no conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice or against judgment creditors without notice.\" The finance company sued to enforce its judgment lien against the businessman's real estate. The bank intervened in the action, contending that the judgment lien was a second lien on the real estate and that its mortgage was a first lien. Is the bank's contention correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the judgment lien was recorded before the mortgage, and the finance company had no actual notice of the\nmortgage.\nB. No, because the businessman was not personally liable for the mortgage debt, and the mortgage was therefore void.\nC. Yes, because a mortgage prior in time has priority over a subsequent judgment lien.\nD. Yes, because the recording of a mortgage relates back to the date of execution of the mortgage note.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The police learned that a person with the woman's name and physical description lived at a particular address. When police officers went to that address, the house appeared to be unoccupied: the windows and doors were boarded up with plywood, and the lawn had not been mowed for a long time. A neighbor confirmed that the house belonged to the woman but said that the woman had not been there for several months. The officers knocked repeatedly on the front door and shouted, \"Police! Open up!\" Receiving no response, they tore the plywood off the door, smashed through the door with a sledgehammer, and entered the house. They found no one inside, but they did find an illegal sawed-off shotgun. Upon her return to the house a few weeks later, the woman was charged with unlawful possession of the shotgun. The woman has moved to suppress the use of the shotgun as evidence at her trial. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the officers acted in good faith under the authority of a valid warrant.\nB. No, because the officers did not violate any legitimate expectation of privacy in the house since the woman had\nabandoned it.\nC. Yes, because the officers entered the house by means of excessive force.\nD. Yes, because the officers had no reason to believe that the woman was in the house.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Upon learning that the coworker was at a neighbor's house, the man grabbed his gun and went to the neighbor's house hoping to provoke the coworker into attacking him so that he could then shoot the coworker. After arriving at the house, the man insulted the coworker and bragged that he had had sexual relations with the coworker's wife two weeks earlier. This statement was not true, but it enraged the coworker, who grabbed a knife from the kitchen table and ran toward the man. The man then shot and killed the coworker. What is the most serious homicide offense of which the man could properly be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Murder in the first degree.\nB. Murder in the second degree.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter, because he provoked the coworker.\nD. No form of criminal homicide, because he acted in self-defense.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

One day while the officer was on highway patrol, her radar gun clocked the man's car at 68 mph in an area where the maximum posted speed limit was 65 mph. The officer's usual practice was not to stop a car unless it was going at least 5 mph over the posted limit, but contrary to her usual practice, she decided to stop the man's car in the hope that she might discover evidence of drug dealing. After she stopped the car and announced that she would be writing a speeding ticket, the officer ordered the man and his passenger to step out of the car. When the passenger stepped out, the officer saw that the passenger had been sitting on a clear bag of what the officer immediately recognized as marijuana. The officer arrested both the man and the passenger for possession of marijuana. At their joint trial, the man and the passenger claim that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the officer improperly (1) stopped the car for speeding as a pretext for investigating a hunch rather than for the stated purpose of issuing a traffic ticket and (2) ordered the passenger to step out of the car even though there was no reason to believe that the passenger was a criminal or dangerous.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

The vaporizer consisted of a gallon-size glass jar, which held water to be heated until it became steam, and a metal heating unit into which the jar fit. The jar was covered by a plastic cap with an opening to allow the steam to escape. At the time the vaporizer was manufactured and sold, there was no safer alternative design. The booklet that accompanied the vaporizer read: \"This product is safe, spillproof, and practically foolproof. It shuts off automatically when the water is gone.\" The booklet had a picture of a vaporizer sending steam over a baby's crib. The mother used the vaporizer whenever the child was suffering from congestion. She placed the vaporizer on the floor near the child's bed. One night, the child got out of bed to get a drink of water and tripped over the cord of the vaporizer as she crossed the room. The top of the vaporizer separated from the base, and boiling water from the jar spilled on the child when the vaporizer tipped over. The child suffered serious burns as a consequence. The child's representative brought an action for damages against the manufacturer of the vaporizer. The manufacturer moved to dismiss after the representative presented the evidence above. Should the manufacturer's motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a jury could find that the manufacturer expressly represented that the vaporizer was spillproof.\nB. No, because the vaporizer caused a serious injury to the child.\nC. Yes, because it should have been obvious to the mother that the water in the jar would become boiling hot.\nD.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nSelf-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside. When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA firstborn child was examined as an infant by a doctor who was a specialist in the diagnosis of speech and hearing impairments. Although the doctor should have concluded that the infant was totally deaf due to a hereditary condition, the doctor negligently concluded that the infant's hearing was normal. After the diagnosis, but before they learned that the infant was in fact deaf, the parents conceived a second child who also suffered total deafness due to the hereditary condition. The parents claim that they would not have conceived the second child had they known of the high probability of the hereditary condition. They have sought the advice of their attorney regarding which negligence action against the doctor is most likely to succeed. What sort of action against the doctor should the attorney recommend?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. A medical malpractice action seeking damages on the second child's behalf for expenses due to his deafness, on the\nground that the doctor's negligence caused him to be born deaf.\nB. A wrongful birth action by the parents for expenses they have incurred due to the second child's deafness, on the\nground that but for the doctor's negligence, they would not have conceived the second child.\nC. A wrongful life action by the parents for expenses for the entire period of the second child's life, on the ground that\nbut for the doctor's negligence, the second child would not have been born.\nD.

The supplier promptly sold the freezer to another buyer for $11,000. If the customer sues the supplier for breach of contract, is the customer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Soon thereafter the seller filed for bankruptcy, having paid nothing on his debt to the bank. Five years after the debt had been discharged in bankruptcy, the seller contracted to sell certain goods to a buyer for $5,000. The contract provided that the buyer would pay the $5,000 to the bank \"as payment of the $5,000 the seller owes the bank.\" The only debt that the seller ever owed the bank is the $5,000 debt that was discharged in bankruptcy. The seller delivered the goods to the buyer, who accepted them. If the bank becomes aware of the contract between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer refuses to pay anything to the bank, is the bank likely to succeed in an action against the buyer for $5,000?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the buyer's promise to pay the bank was not supported by consideration.\nB. No, because the seller's debt was discharged in bankruptcy.\nC. Yes, because the bank was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the buyer and the seller.\nD. Yes, because no consideration is required to support a promise to pay a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The builder gave the lender a writing that stated, \"Any money I receive from the homeowner will be paid immediately to the lender, regardless of any demands from other creditors.\" The builder died after completing the job but before the homeowner paid. The lender demanded that the homeowner pay the $10,000 due to the builder directly to the lender. The homeowner refused, saying that he would pay directly to the builder's estate everything that he owed the builder.
