The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA federal civil statute prohibited fishing in any body of water that was located within a national park and contained a particular endangered species of fish. The statute authorized federal district courts to enjoin knowing violators of the statute from the use of all national park facilities for up to two years. After a vacationer was found by a federal district court to have knowingly violated the statute, the court issued an injunction against his use of all national park facilities for two years. The vacationer appealed. Before the appeals court heard the vacationer's case, Congress repealed the statute by a law that expressly made the repeal effective retroactive to a date one month before the vacationer's violation of the statute. The law also directly cited the vacationer's case and stated that it was intended to \"repeal all the statutory prohibitions that formed the basis for decisions\" such as that rendered against the vacationer. On the basis of this law, the vacationer has asked the appeals court to vacate the injunction issued against him. Counsel for the United States has objected, contending that, as applied to the specific case pending in the appeals court, the law is unconstitutional. How should the appeals court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. For the United States, because Congress defied the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws by\nretroactively changing the consequences for violating the statute after the violation was proved in a trial court.\nB. For the United States, because the law's citation to the vacationer's case demonstrates that Congress intended to\ncompel the appeals court to reach a particular result and, therefore, sought to exercise judicial powers vested\nexclusively in the courts by Article III.\nC. For the vacationer, because Congress has the power to determine the laws to be applied by the federal courts and to\nrequire retroactive application of those laws to any specifically identified case that it chooses.\nD. For the vacationer, because Congress is authorized to make substantive changes to federal civil statutes and to direct\nthat those changes be applied by the courts to all actions in which a final judgment has not yet been rendered.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Throughout the civil war, the ruling faction controlled the majority of the country's territory, and the United States afforded diplomatic immunity to the ambassador representing the ruling faction. A newly elected President of the United States decided to recognize a rebel group as the government of the foreign country and notified the ambassador from the ruling faction that she must leave the United States within 10 days. The ambassador filed an action in federal district court for a declaration that the ruling faction was the true government of the foreign country and for an injunction against enforcement of the President's order that she leave the United States. The United States has moved to dismiss the action. If the court dismisses the action, what will be the most likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The question is a federal court's exercise of jurisdiction, and the court therefore must determine whether the action is ripe for review. The ambassador's suit may appropriately be characterized as a dispute concerning the scope of diplomatic immunity, which is an international relations issue that falls within the foreign affairs clause of the Constitution, which reserves to the federal government plenary power to conduct foreign affairs. As such, the court would not entertain the suit because it does not have jurisdiction. C is incorrect. The case falls within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court because the suit involves a dispute between a foreign country and the United States. However, this is not a case within original jurisdiction because there is not a controversy between two states. D is incorrect.

The other vehicle involved in the accident was a truck owned by a furniture manufacturer and driven by one of its employees. The manufacturer's headquarters are in State B. Its products are sold by retailers in State A, but it has no office, plant, or agent for service of process there. The motorist brought an action against the manufacturer in a state court in State A. The manufacturer appeared specially to contest that court's jurisdiction over it. The court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the manufacturer by virtue of State A's long-arm statute. At trial, the court instructed the jury to apply State A law, under which a plaintiff's contributory negligence is a basis for reducing an award of damages but not for denying recovery altogether. Under State B law, contributory negligence is a complete defense. The jury found that the manufacturer was negligent and that its negligence was a cause of the motorist's injuries. It also found that the motorist was negligent, though to a lesser degree than the manufacturer, and that the motorist's negligence contributed to the accident. It returned a verdict in favor of the motorist and awarded her $1 million in damages. The manufacturer appealed the judgment entered on this verdict, asserting error in the court's ruling on jurisdiction and in its application of State A law instead of State B law. The manufacturer raised all federal constitutional claims pertinent to these claims of error. The highest court in State A affirmed the trial court's judgment, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied the manufacturer's petition for a writ of certiorari. The motorist has brought an action against the manufacturer in a state court in State B to collect on the judgment. The manufacturer has defended on all relevant federal constitutional grounds. How should the State B court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. For the manufacturer, because a judgment entered by a court that lacks jurisdiction over one of the parties is not\nentitled to full faith and credit, and the State A court could not constitutionally assert jurisdiction over the\nmanufacturer because of the manufacturer's lack of a presence in that state.\nB. For the manufacturer, because the State A court was bound by the full faith and credit clause to apply State B law to\nan accident that occurred in State B and in which a State B company was involved.\nC. For the motorist, because the manufacturer litigated the issues of jurisdiction and choice of law in the State A court,\nand the final judgment of that court is entitled to full faith and credit in the State B court.\nD. For the motorist, because the Supreme Court's denial of certiorari to review the judgment of the highest court in State\nA conclusively establishes that the manufacturer's federal constitutional claims are invalid.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The full faith and credit due to a judgment of a court that lacks personal jurisdiction over a defendant is only to serve as an attachment of that judgment in the state in which the court that lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant is situated. Since the State A court that entered the judgment did not have personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer, the full faith and credit due to that judgment is only to attach it in State A, and State B, where the accident occurred and the manufacturer was doing business, has full faith and credit discretion whether to enforce that judgment or not. B is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that full faith and credit must be given only to the choice of law rules applied by the State A court, and not to the resulting determination that State A tort law applied. Therefore, the State B court is free to apply its own choice of law rules and determine that State B tort law applied. C is correct. The full faith and credit due to the judgment of a court that has entered an unconstitutional judgment is only to attach that judgment in the state in which the court that entered the unconstitutional judgment is situated. Since the State A court that entered the judgment was acting unconstitutionally by applying State A tort law when the accident occurred in State B and the manufacturer was doing business in State B, the full faith and credit due to that judgment is only to attach it in State A and State B, and the State B court has full faith and credit discretion whether to enforce that judgment or not. D is incorrect. The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the highest court in State A does not mean that the U.S. Supreme Court has determined the merits of the case.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

Congress appropriated a fixed sum of money to fund loans made pursuant to the program and gave a designated federal agency discretion to decide which applicants were to receive the loans. Two weeks after the program was established, a family farmer applied to the agency for a loan. Agency officials promptly reviewed her application and summarily denied it. The farmer has sued the agency in federal district court, claiming only that the denial of her application without the opportunity for a hearing violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The farmer claims that she could have proved at such a hearing that without the federal loan it would be necessary for her to sell her farm. Should the court uphold the agency's decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because due process requires federal agencies to provide a hearing before making any factual determination that\nadversely affects an identified individual on the basis of his or her particular circumstances.\nB. No, because the denial of a loan may deprive the farmer of an established liberty interest to pursue her chosen\noccupation.\nC. Yes, because the applicable statute gives the farmer no legitimate claim of entitlement to receive a loan.\nD. Yes , because the spending clause of Article I, Section 8, gives Congress plenary power to control the distribution of\nappropriated funds in any manner it wishes.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The company acquired mining equipment and began to plan its mining operations. Just as the company was about to begin mining, Congress enacted a statute that imposed a number of new environmental regulations and land-reclamation requirements on all mining operations within the United States. The statute made the company's planned mining operations economically infeasible. As a result, the company sold the tract of land to a farmer. While the sale price allowed the company to recover its original investment in the land, it did not cover the additional cost of the mining equipment the company had purchased or the profits it had expected to earn from its mining operations on the land. In an action filed against the appropriate federal official, the company claims that the statute effected a taking of its property for which it is entitled to just compensation in an amount equal to the cost of the mining equipment it purchased and the profits it expected to earn from its mining operations on the land.

The cost of the mining equipment is recoverable as a taking under the Fifth Amendment's provisions for the taking of private property for public use. But the statute does not prohibit the company from continuing to operate its mine; rather, the statute imposes new regulatory burdens on the company's mining operations. As such, the new burdens are regulatory and not punitive, and the company is not entitled to just compensation for the new regulatory burdens. In any event, the lost profit claim is invalid. The Supreme Court has held that the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment does not guarantee a property owner compensation for economic losses caused by the enactment of unfavorable legislation. B is incorrect. Although the mining equipment might be considered realty under common law principles, the Supreme Court has held that constitutional rights attaching to the possession of property do not turn on the nature of the property itself. Because the equipment relates to the company's planned mining operations, it is a form of personal property, and the company is not entitled to just compensation for its removal. C is incorrect.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

Although PTSD is a possible result of a car accident, it is not common. Many accident victims in a particular state who received the mailings complained that the mailings were disturbing and were an invasion of their privacy. These victims also reported that as a result of the mailings, their regard for psychotherapists and for psychotherapy as a form of treatment had diminished. In response, the state enacted a law prohibiting any licensed psychotherapist from sending mailings that raised the concern of PTSD to any car accident victim in the state until 30 days after the accident. The state justified the law as an effort to address the victims' complaints as well as to protect the reputation of psychotherapy as a form of treatment. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law singles out one type of message for prohibition while allowing others.\nB. No, because the mailings provide information to consumers.\nC. Yes, because mailings suggesting the possibility of developing PTSD as the result of an accident are misleading.\nD. Yes, because the law protects the privacy of accident victims and the public regard for psychotherapy without being\nsubstantially more restrictive than necessary.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The prohibition of the mailings is not as restrictive as necessary to promote a compelling state interest because it allows other means of communication of the same message. B is incorrect. The protection of consumers against misleading advertising is not a compelling state interest that overrides the First Amendment right to send the mailings. C is incorrect. Merely suggesting the possibility of developing PTSD is not misleading. D is incorrect. privacy and the reputation of a profession are not compelling state interests that override the First Amendment right to send the mailings."

The mailings contain commercial speech, because they advertise services provided by the psychotherapists. A restriction on commercial speech is subject to a form of intermediate judicial scrutiny, requiring the government to show that the restriction directly advances an important government interest and that the restriction is not substantially more extensive than necessary to protect that interest. The law here satisfies that standard; the 30-day waiting period for the psychotherapists' mailings narrowly serves the government's substantial interests in protecting both the privacy of accident victims and the public regard for psychotherapy.",

The organization's membership is generally open to the public, but its bylaws permit its officers to refuse to admit anyone to membership who does not adhere to the organization's mission statement. In a recent state administrative proceeding, the organization opposed plans to begin mining operations in the mountains surrounding a small town. Its opposition prevented the mine from being opened on schedule. In an effort to force the organization to withdraw its opposition, certain residents of the town attended a meeting of the organization and tried to become members, but the officers refused to admit them. The residents sued the organization, claiming that the refusal to admit them was discriminatory and violated a local ordinance that prohibits any organization from discriminating on the basis of an individual's political views. The organization responded that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to its membership decisions. Are the residents likely to prevail in their claim?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the membership policies of a private organization are not state action.\nB. No, because the organization's right to freedom of association allows it to refuse to admit potential members who do\nnot adhere to its mission statement.\nC.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The facts indicate that the husband and wife held the land in joint tenancy. A joint tenancy cannot be created without the \"four unities\" (time, title, possession and interest), and can only be terminated by a severance, partition, or by the entirety of the unities being terminated by one of the joint tenants. The husband's execution of the will terminated the joint tenancy and instead created a testamentary trust for the friend. As such, Wife retained an undivided 50% interest in the land, which she inherited by the applicable applicable statute upon her husband's death. There was no termination of the joint tenancy, so the wife is the sole owner of the land. A is incorrect. The wife's interest in the land as a joint tenant was not terminated by anything she did. It was instead the husband's execution of the will that terminated the joint tenancy. B is incorrect. The wife's interest in the land as a joint tenant was not terminated by her failure to consent to the gift to the friend. It was instead the husband's execution of the will that terminated the joint tenancy. C is incorrect.

The language of the deed was sufficient to create a common law joint tenancy with right of survivorship, which is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. The woman mailed the deed to the son with a letter saying: \"Because I intend you and your wife to have my house after my death, I am enclosing a deed to the house. However, I intend to live in the house for the rest of my life, so don't record the deed until I die. The deed will be effective at my death.\" The son put the deed in his desk. The wife discovered the deed and recorded it without the son's knowledge. Subsequently, the son and the wife separated, and the wife, without telling anyone, conveyed her interest in the house to a friend who immediately reconveyed it to the wife. The woman learned that the son and the wife had separated and also learned what had happened to the deed to the house.

The eastern portion of the land was undeveloped and unused. A farmer owned a farm, the western border of which was along the eastern border of the man's land. The two tracts of land had never been in common ownership. Five years ago, the farmer asked the man for permission to use a designated two acres of the eastern portion of the man's land to enlarge her farm's irrigation facilities. The man orally gave his permission for such use. Since then, the farmer has invested substantial amounts of money and effort each year to develop and maintain the irrigation facilities within the two-acre parcel. The man has been fully aware of the farmer's actions. Nothing regarding this matter was ever reduced to writing. Last year, the man gave the entire tract of land as a gift to his nephew. The deed of gift made no reference to the farmer or the two-acre parcel. When the nephew had the land surveyed and discovered the facts, he notified the farmer in writing, \"Your license to use the two-acre parcel has been terminated.\" The notice instructed the farmer to remove her facilities from the two-acre parcel immediately. The farmer refused the nephew's demand. In an appropriate action between the nephew and the farmer to determine whether the farmer had a right to continue to use the two-acre parcel, the court ruled in favor of the farmer. What is the most likely reason for the court's ruling?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The investments and efforts by the farmer in reliance on the license estop the man, and now the nephew as the man's\ndonee, from terminating the license.\nB. The nephew is merely a donee.\nC. The farmer has acquired an easement based on prior use.\nD. The farmer received a license coupled with an interest.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Here, the facts show that the friend who conveyed the land to the corporation owns all of the land that the other friend now owns. The facts also show that the friend who conveyed the land was the owner of the land at the time of the conveyance.

The statute of frauds requires that any contract for the sale of a land interest be in writing or memorialized in some other manner.

The lease would have to be assigned to transfer title to the building, and the lease could not be assigned until it expired.

The property included a large store and a parking lot. At the start of the lease period, the tenant took possession and with the landlord's oral consent installed counters, display cases, shelving, and special lighting. Both parties complied with all lease terms. The lease is set to expire next month. Two weeks ago, when the landlord contacted the tenant about a possible lease renewal, she learned that the tenant had decided not to renew the lease, and that the tenant planned to remove all of the above-listed items on or before the lease termination date. The landlord claimed that all the items had become part of the real estate and had to remain on the premises. The tenant asserted his right and intention to remove all the items. Both the lease and the statutes of the jurisdiction are silent on the matter in dispute. At the time the landlord consented and the tenant installed the items, nothing was said about the tenant's right to retain or remove the items. The landlord has sued the tenant to enjoin his removal of the items. How is the court likely to rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The man has never physically occupied the land. Nineteen years ago, a woman entered the farm. The character and duration of the woman's possession of the farm caused her to become the owner of the farm under the adverse possession law of the jurisdiction. Three years ago, when the woman was not present, a neighbor took over possession of the farm. The neighbor repaired fences, put up \"no trespassing\" signs, and did some plowing. When the woman returned, she found the neighbor in possession of the farm. The neighbor vigorously rejected the woman's claimed right to possession and threatened force. The woman withdrew. The woman then went to the man and told him of the history of activity on the farm. The woman orally told the man that she had been wrong to try to take his farm. She expressly waived any claim she had to the land. The man thanked her.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

The promissory note stated that the businessman was not personally liable for the mortgage debt. One week later, a finance company obtained a judgment against the businessman for $50,000 and filed the judgment in the county where the real estate was located. At the time the judgment was filed, the finance company had no actual notice of the bank's mortgage. Two weeks after that filing, the bank recorded its mortgage on the businessman's real estate. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"Unless the same be recorded according to law, no conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice or against judgment creditors without notice.\" The finance company sued to enforce its judgment lien against the businessman's real estate. The bank intervened in the action, contending that the judgment lien was a second lien on the real estate and that its mortgage was a first lien. Is the bank's contention correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the judgment lien was recorded before the mortgage, and the finance company had no actual notice of the\nmortgage.\nB. No, because the businessman was not personally liable for the mortgage debt, and the mortgage was therefore void.\nC. Yes, because a mortgage prior in time has priority over a subsequent judgment lien.\nD. Yes, because the recording of a mortgage relates back to the date of execution of the mortgage note.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "Answer A is incorrect. The recording act quoted in this fact pattern is a race-notice act. To prevail under a race-notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded their deed or mortgage before the party who is trying to revoke a prior mortgage or deed (the \"debtor\") recorded theirs. Once a BFP records their deed or mortgage before the debtor, that prior mortgage or deed is voided and the race is over. The finance company was a BFP because it obtained a judgment against the businessman before the bank recorded its mortgage. The businessman's execution of the mortgage to the bank before the finance company obtained its judgment against the businessman all act to make the finance company a BFP. The judgment lien taken by the finance company is a prior mortgage, and it will be voided because the bank was a BFP. The bank's mortgage is an later mortgage, and it will defeat the finance company's judgment lien. The bank's mortgage is good against the finance company because the finance company was not a BFP. Answer B is incorrect. The businessman's personal liability on the mortgage does not make the mortgage void."

At the closing, the buyer signed a promissory note to the seller for 15% of the purchase price but did not execute a mortgage. The bank knew of the loan made by the seller and of the promissory note executed by the buyer to the seller. The buyer also signed a note to the bank, secured by a mortgage, for the 80% advanced by the bank. The buyer has now defaulted on both loans. There are no applicable statutes. Which loan has priority?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank's loan, because the seller can finance a part of the purchase price only by use of an installment land contract.\nB.

This is a question about priority of purchase-money security interests, and the applicable rule is that a purchaser's purchase-money lien takes priority over existing mortgages and prior encumbrances on the property. Such liens are created by payment of part of the purchase price (or by the giving of a satisfactory bond) under an installment land contract. The seller's purchase-money lien takes priority over the bank's loan. B is incorrect. This answer invokes the priority rules for mortgages. The mortgage on the property securing the bank loan was defaulted. C is incorrect. This answer invokes the priority rules for promissory notes. The seller's note to the buyer is unsecured, and therefore takes no priority over the bank loan. D is incorrect. The bank knew that the seller had an equitable vendor's lien?

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA woman was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury. When she arrived, she was taken into the grand jury room to be questioned. She answered preliminary questions about her name and address. She was then asked where she had been at a certain time on a specified night when a murder had occurred. Before answering the question, the woman said that she wanted to consult her attorney, who was waiting outside the grand jury room, and she was allowed to do so. When she returned to the grand jury room, she stated that she refused to answer the question because the answer might incriminate her. The prosecutor believes that the woman's nephew committed the murder. The nephew has said that he was with the woman at the time of the murder, and the prosecutor believes that this alibi is false. The prosecutor does not believe that the woman is guilty of the murder, either as a principal or as an accomplice, although he does believe that the woman may be guilty of other crimes. The prosecutor wants to compel the woman to answer the question by whatever means will result in the least harm to the prosecution's case. Which of the following steps should the prosecutor take to get the woman to answer the question?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Request the grand jury to order the woman to answer the question.\nB. Ask the woman's attorney to explain to the woman that the rules of evidence do not apply in grand jury proceedings,\nand to advise her that she cannot refuse to testify.\nC. Prepare the documents necessary to grant the woman immunity from any future use against her of her grand jury\ntestimony or any evidence derived from it.\nD.

The prosecutor should prepare the documents necessary to grant the woman immunity from any future prosecution for any crime she might disclose in the course of her testimony. If the grand jury overhears the woman's statement, it could potentially grant immunity to her for any offense she might disclose. However, this is not the best choice of actions for the prosecutor to take. The grand jury only has the power to grant immunity for contempt, not for any other offense. In addition, the grand jury lacks the power to compel testimony. B is incorrect. The woman's attorney cannot require the woman to testify. The grand jury cannot require her to testify either. C is incorrect. The prosecutor cannot grant the woman immunity from any possible criminal liability for any offense she might commit in the future. The only forms of immunity available to grant are immunity from prosecution (granted by the Attorney General or his designee under 59 U.S.C. \u00a7 1965(b)) or immunity for contempt (granted only by the grand jury).

The prosecutor did not disclose to the grand jury that the witness had been convicted four years earlier of perjury. The grand jury returned an indictment, and the defendant pleaded not guilty. Shortly thereafter, the prosecutor took the case to trial, calling the witness to testify before the jury. The prosecutor did not disclose the witness's prior perjury conviction until the defense was preparing to rest. Defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial, which the court denied. Instead, the court allowed the defense to recall the witness for the purpose of impeaching him with this conviction, but the witness could not be located. The court then allowed the defense to introduce documentary evidence of the witness's criminal record to the jury before resting its case. The jury convicted the defendant.

An attempt is an act done with the intent to commit a crime, where the act does not succeed in the commission of the offense. It is an \"unsuccessful crime.\" In an attempt crime, the defendant must take a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. Here, the wife took a substantial step when she poisoned her husband with the intent to kill him. She also caused danger of serious bodily injury to the maid, which is sufficient for manslaughter. The maid's death constituted the consummation of the offense, even if the wife did not intend to kill the maid. Although the wife's act posed a serious risk of harm to the maid, it was only a general risk, since the maid voluntarily consumed the wine. The maid's death was the result of voluntary self-poisoning, and not the result of force or coercion by the wife. Therefore, the maid's death was her own act, and she is not an innocent victim in an attempt case. Because the maid knew of the existence of the poison and voluntarily consumed it, the maid is not an innocent victim and there is insufficient evidence of a general threat to find her death the consummation of the offense. In addition, the wife cannot be convicted of murder for the maid. Murder is the unlawful killing of another with malice aforethought. The maid's death from cyanide poisoning was the voluntary act of the maid, and she was not coerced into drinking the wine by the wife. The maid is an innocent victim and cannot be the basis for conviction of the wife of murder."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant is charged with an offense under a statute that provides as follows: \"Any person who, while intoxicated, appears in any public place and manifests a drunken condition by obstreperous or indecent conduct is guilty of a misdemeanor.\" At trial, the evidence shows that the defendant was intoxicated when police officers burst into his house and arrested him pursuant to a valid warrant. It was a cold night, and the officers hustled the defendant out of his house without giving him time to get his coat. The defendant became angry and obstreperous when the officers refused to let him go back into the house to retrieve his coat. The officers left him handcuffed outside in the street, waiting for a special squad car to arrive. The arrest warrant was later vacated. Can the defendant properly be convicted of violating the statute?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant's claim of mistreatment is valid.\nB. No, because the statute requires proof of a voluntary appearance in a public place.\nC. Yes, because the defendant voluntarily became intoxicated.\nD. Yes, because the defendant voluntarily behaved in an obstreperous manner.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

One day while the officer was on highway patrol, her radar gun clocked the man's car at 68 mph in an area where the maximum posted speed limit was 65 mph. The officer's usual practice was not to stop a car unless it was going at least 5 mph over the posted limit, but contrary to her usual practice, she decided to stop the man's car in the hope that she might discover evidence of drug dealing. After she stopped the car and announced that she would be writing a speeding ticket, the officer ordered the man and his passenger to step out of the car. When the passenger stepped out, the officer saw that the passenger had been sitting on a clear bag of what the officer immediately recognized as marijuana. The officer arrested both the man and the passenger for possession of marijuana. At their joint trial, the man and the passenger claim that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the officer improperly (1) stopped the car for speeding as a pretext for investigating a hunch rather than for the stated purpose of issuing a traffic ticket and (2) ordered the passenger to step out of the car even though there was no reason to believe that the passenger was a criminal or dangerous. Are the man and the passenger correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, as to both the stop of the car and the officer's order that the passenger step out of the car.\nB.

Thus, it was unreasonable for the officer to detain the car for further investigation of her hunch that the driver was a drug dealer.

Further, it was unreasonable for the officer to order the passenger out of the car, because there was no suspicion that the passenger was involved in any criminal activity. B is incorrect.

The defendant objects to this proposed testimony, arguing that it is hearsay and that the victim had no personal knowledge of the identity of the perpetrator.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The victim's testimony concerning his previous statement to the passerby is admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of the declarant's then existing state of mind. The victim's statement to the passerby was made while the victim was in the state of mind of having recently been the victim of an assault by the defendant and was describing or explaining the reason for making the statement. The statement is admissible to prove the victim's memory was too untrustworthy to permit in-court testimony. The victim had no memory of the assault itself, but he did have some recollection of the assault before he lost consciousness. The victim's testimony is subject to cross-examination. The victim can be cross-examined about his lack of memory and his prior statement to the passerby. In addition, there has been a showing that the victim had some knowledge of the identity of his assailant. The victim's statement to the passerby is admissible under the then existing mental condition exception to the hearsay rule. A is incorrect. There is no requirement that there be a finding that the declarant had first-hand knowledge of the event or matter about which the statement was made. The victim does not have to be found to have first-hand knowledge of the identity of his attacker for his testimony to be admissible. B is incorrect. Because the victim has no memory of the assault itself, his ability to be cross-examined will not be unfair if the victim's prior statement to the passerby is admitted. In addition, the victim's testimony is admissible as a prior consistent statement. The victim's loss of memory makes it possible that he may try to distance himself from his prior statement to the passerby by testifying that he does not remember being assaulted by the defendant. Because the victim's prior statement is in conflict with his present testimony, it is a prior consistent statement and is admissible. D is incorrect. The victim's testimony is not a statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind. The victim's testimony is his recollection of what he said to the passerby.

When she submitted a claim of loss for the car to her insurance company, the insurance company refused to pay, asserting that the woman's policy had lapsed due to the nonpayment of her premium. The woman sued the insurance company for breach of contract. At trial, the woman testified that she had, in a timely manner, placed a stamped, properly addressed envelope containing the premium payment in the outgoing mail bin at her office. The woman's secretary then testified that every afternoon at closing time he takes all outgoing mail in the bin to the post office.

The woman and the insurance company have both moved for a directed verdict. For which party, if either, should the court direct a verdict?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAn assistant to a famous writer surreptitiously observed the writer as the writer typed her private password into her personal computer in order to access her email. On several subsequent occasions in the writer's absence, the assistant read the writer's email messages and printed out selections from them. The assistant later quit his job and earned a considerable amount of money by leaking information to the media that he had learned from reading the writer's email messages. All of the information published about the writer as a result of the assistant's conduct was true and concerned matters of public interest. The writer's secretary had seen the assistant reading the writer's emails and printing out selections, and she has told the writer what she saw. The writer now wishes to sue the assistant for damages. At trial, the writer can show that the media leaks could have come only from someone reading her email on her personal computer. Can the writer recover damages from the assistant?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the assistant was an invitee on the premises.\nB. No, because the published information resulting from the assistant's conduct was true and concerned matters of public\ninterest.\nC. Yes, because the assistant invaded the writer's privacy.\nD. Yes, because the published information resulting from the assistant's conduct constituted publication of private facts\nconcerning the writer.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "D is correct. The facts in this question indicate that the assistant is likely to be privileged to enter the writer's premises, since the assistant was her employer's assistant. However, the assistant's access was for the employer's business purposes--to enable him to do his job as the writer's assistant. It was not for the purposes of conducting a business enterprise. In addition, the facts indicate that the assistant's presence on the premises was reasonable and not uninvited. The writer can state a claim for intrusion upon seclusion against the assistant because the assistant invaded the writer's right to privacy by reading private emails that were sent on the writer's own computer. A claim for intrusion upon seclusion requires a showing of (1) intrusion, which is established by having private affairs seen by the defendant, and (2) seclusion, which is established by a private place being visited. The fact that the assistant read the emails on the writer's own personal computer constitutes an intrusion, and the fact that the emails were private constitutes seclusion. The writer also has a valid claim for public disclosure of private facts. The facts in this question indicate that the assistant printed out and gave publicity to private information about the writer by publishing true information concerning matters of public concern and at the same time offending the sensibilities of the writer and the audience by exposing her to private experiences that were, if revealed, not newsworthy on their face. The publication of the writer's private emails concerning matters of public concern qualifies as true information concerning matters of public concern, and the fact that the emails were private to the writer qualifies as an invasion of her seclusion."

            "explanation": "C is correct. The manufacturer of a dangerous product is strictly liable for any harm caused by the product if the harm could have occurred in the normal operation of the product. Ordinarily, the duty of strict liability would be imposed on the person who distributed the product to the driver, but in this case the manufacturer created the risk of harmful use that its product posed and imposed that risk on itself. The manufacturer's creation of the risk of harmful use is shown by its decision to manufacture and to ship the product without taking precautions to prevent harmful uses of the product. The manufacturer's shipment of the product without taking precautions created the risk that the product would cause harmful injury to person or property, even if the product was not used in a non-harmful manner. When the driver's car struck the toxic materials, the collision caused the driver's injuries. The collision was a normal and foreseeable consequence of the unsecured shipment of the toxic materials by the manufacturer, and the manufacturer is strictly liable for the injuries the driver suffered.

The woman died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. The pedestrian became very depressed immediately after the incident and developed physical symptoms as a result of his emotional distress. The pedestrian has brought an action against the driver of the truck for negligent infliction of emotional distress. In her defense, the driver asserts that she should not be held liable, because the pedestrian's emotional distress and resulting physical symptoms are not compensable. What is the strongest argument that the pedestrian can make in response to the driver's defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The pedestrian saw the driver hit the woman.\nB. The pedestrian was acting as a Good Samaritan.\nC. The pedestrian was covered in the woman's blood and developed physical symptoms as a result of his emotional\ndistress.\nD. The pedestrian was in the zone of danger.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "C is correct. The driver's defense that the pedestrian's emotional distress and resulting physical symptoms are not compensable fails because it is not a correct statement of the law. Under the negligent infliction of emotional distress (NEID) doctrine, if the defendant's conduct intentionally or knowingly causes emotional distress that is severe, it is for that reason alone that the distress is compensable. C is the best argument because it is the strongest counter to the driver's defense. A is incorrect because the fact that the pedestrian saw the driver hit the woman is not a necessary element of the pedestrian's claim. B is incorrect because it is not a necessary element of the pedestrian's claim that he was acting as a Good Samaritan. D is incorrect because being in the zone of danger is not a necessary element of the pedestrian's claim."

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nUpon the recommendation of her child's pediatrician, a mother purchased a vaporizer for her child, who had been suffering from respiratory congestion. The vaporizer consisted of a gallon-size glass jar, which held water to be heated until it became steam, and a metal heating unit into which the jar fit. The jar was covered by a plastic cap with an opening to allow the steam to escape. At the time the vaporizer was manufactured and sold, there was no safer alternative design. The booklet that accompanied the vaporizer read: \"This product is safe, spillproof, and practically foolproof. It shuts off automatically when the water is gone.\" The booklet had a picture of a vaporizer sending steam over a baby's crib. The mother used the vaporizer whenever the child was suffering from congestion. She placed the vaporizer on the floor near the child's bed. One night, the child got out of bed to get a drink of water and tripped over the cord of the vaporizer as she crossed the room. The top of the vaporizer separated from the base, and boiling water from the jar spilled on the child when the vaporizer tipped over. The child suffered serious burns as a consequence. The child's representative brought an action for damages against the manufacturer of the vaporizer. The manufacturer moved to dismiss after the representative presented the evidence above. Should the manufacturer's motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a jury could find that the manufacturer expressly represented that the vaporizer was spillproof.\nB. No, because the vaporizer caused a serious injury to the child.\nC. Yes, because it should have been obvious to the mother that the water in the jar would become boiling hot.\nD.

            "explanation": "A manufacturer of products is strictly liable for any harm caused by its product if the product, when used in a normal way, causes a foreseeable harm of a type that the product was designed to prevent. Here, the vaporizer is a useful and safe product that is designed to relieve congestion. But it is also a highly burn-prone product, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover on the theory that the manufacturer designed a defective product. The child's action should not be dismissed. Answer A is incorrect because the express representation that the vaporizer was spillproof does not need to be established in order to establish the manufacturer's liability. In fact, the plaintiff should be able to show that the design of the vaporizer made it likely that the vaporizer would be spilled. Answer C is incorrect because the mere fact that the manufacturer could have foreseen the harm will not suffice to establish that the manufacturer designed the product to cause the particular harm. In addition, the plaintiff's injury must be of a type that the product was designed to prevent. Answer D is incorrect because the fact that the vaporizer could have been made safer is irrelevant to the issue of strict liability. Instead, it is relevant that the vaporizer could have been designed in a way that would not have caused the plaintiff's particular injury."

There is no evidence of negligence on the part of the appliance store because the facts do not state that the store placed a defective television into the son's possession. The store placed a new, non-defective television into the son's possession. The son's claim is that the television he purchased from the store two years ago was the source of the fire. Therefore, there is no evidence of negligence on the part of the appliance store. Thus, the store's motion for summary judgment should be granted. A is incorrect. The issue here is not whether televisions generally catch fire, but whether this television, specifically, was the cause of the fire. In addition, the call of the question indicates that the facts are not sufficient to establish proximate cause. B is incorrect. The appliance store placed the television in the son's possession, and two years later the television caused a fire in the son's living room.

The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA firstborn child was examined as an infant by a doctor who was a specialist in the diagnosis of speech and hearing impairments. Although the doctor should have concluded that the infant was totally deaf due to a hereditary condition, the doctor negligently concluded that the infant's hearing was normal. After the diagnosis, but before they learned that the infant was in fact deaf, the parents conceived a second child who also suffered total deafness due to the hereditary condition. The parents claim that they would not have conceived the second child had they known of the high probability of the hereditary condition. They have sought the advice of their attorney regarding which negligence action against the doctor is most likely to succeed. What sort of action against the doctor should the attorney recommend?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. A medical malpractice action seeking damages on the second child's behalf for expenses due to his deafness, on the\nground that the doctor's negligence caused him to be born deaf.\nB. A wrongful birth action by the parents for expenses they have incurred due to the second child's deafness, on the\nground that but for the doctor's negligence, they would not have conceived the second child.\nC. A wrongful life action by the parents for expenses for the entire period of the second child's life, on the ground that\nbut for the doctor's negligence, the second child would not have been born.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is correct. A medical malpractice action on behalf of a person under the age of 18 is sometimes called a \"claim based on behalf of a minor.\" Such a claim typically requires that the claim be brought on behalf of a child who has been physically or psychologically harmed as a result of the negligent act of a health care provider. Because the second child is deaf due to the negligent failure of the doctor to diagnose the second child's deafness, the second child has an action for medical malpractice against the doctor. B is incorrect. Parents generally have no standing to bring a wrongful birth action on behalf of their unborn child. Such actions are brought only by the child himself after he is born. Moreover, there are no indications that the second child is physically or psychologically impaired. C is incorrect. There are no indications that the second child is physically or psychologically impaired. Moreover, wrongful life actions are generally only brought by the state. D is incorrect. There are no indications that the second child is physically or psychologically impaired. Moreover, wrongful life actions are generally brought by the state."

The child did not touch the dog; the man is the owner of the dog and has the exclusive right to the use of the dog's services. Touching is a form of physical restraint, which is a different tort than trespass to chattels. D is not a correct answer choice. The man's emotional distress is a form of non-physical harm, which is a form of emotional distress rather than physical harm.

The buyer immediately responded via email, asking whether the offer included the house's front porch swing.

Is there a contract for the sale of the house?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the buyer's initial email was a counteroffer.\nB. No, because the offer lapsed before the buyer accepted.\nC.

However, UCC 2-206(2) provides that an offer may be accepted by a promise made after the expiration of an applicable time limit if the offeree reasonably promptly makes the promise upon the sender's request. Here, the offer expired prior to the buyer's acceptance. In addition, the seller's request that the buyer make an acceptance within the time period was not reasonable, because the seller was responsible for the lapse of the period. Thus, B is correct. A is incorrect. The buyer's initial email was not a counteroffer because it never was a firm acceptance of the seller's offer. Instead, the email was made prior to the expiration of the offer period and was requesting that the seller provide more information about the offer. C is incorrect. The buyer's reliance on the offer to purchase the house does not create an enforceable contract, because the offer lapsed before the buyer accepted. In addition, even if the buyer's reliance on the offer created an option contract, it would be unenforceable because the seller was aware of the buyer's reliance on the offer and purposefully refused to sell to the buyer. D is incorrect. The buyer's initial email was not a request for a promise, but rather was a counteroffer for the seller to accept. In addition, the UCC does not create contracts, and the buyer's email was not made upon a promise that was made prior to the offer lapsing."

The jewelry maker did not specify a price, but the market price for 100 ounces of gold at the time of the conversation was approximately $65,000. Without otherwise responding, the company delivered the gold six days later. In the meantime, the project for which the jewelry maker planned to use the gold was canceled. The jewelry maker therefore refused to accept delivery of the gold or to pay the $65,000 demanded by the company.

D is incorrect because even in the absence of a specified price, the company would not be entitled to $65,000 where the jewelry maker had no intent to pay that amount and where the jewelry maker made it clear that the price was not firm.

Therefore, there is a discrepancy in price, not a mistake regarding a basic assumption of the contract. Further, a mistake in regard to a basic assumption of the contract will not excuse the parties from the obligation to perform; rather, it will only excuse liability for damages resulting from a breach. Because there is no mistake regarding a basic assumption of the contract, there is no reason to apply the doctrine of mutual mistake. A is incorrect. The doctrine of unilateral mistake allows a party to avoid liability on a contractual duty where that party's understanding of the other party's obligation under a contract is different from the other party's actual obligation. Here, the farmer believed the developer's offer to be for $1,000 an acre, and the developer believed the farmer's counteroffer to be for $1,100 an acre. Neither party's understanding of the other's offer or counteroffer would allow for the application of the doctrine of unilateral mistake. B is incorrect. The developer's mistaken belief regarding price does not excuse it from performing under the contract. The developer is required to pay $1,100 an acre for the farmer's land, despite its mistaken belief that it was offering $1,000 an acre. C is incorrect.

The contract provided, and both parties intended, that time was of the essence. Before the specified date, however, the seller sold the car to a third party for $20,000. On the specified date, the buyer arrived at the showroom but brought only $10,000. When the seller did not appear at the showroom, the buyer called the seller and asked whether the seller would accept $10,000 for the car immediately and the remaining $5,000 in six weeks. The seller told the buyer that he had sold the car to the third party. If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, will the buyer be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractual obligations were discharged on the ground of impossibility.\nB. No, because the buyer was not prepared to tender her performance on the specified date.\nC. Yes, because the buyer's breach was not material.\nD. Yes, because the seller anticipatorily repudiated the contract when he sold the car to the third party.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": "C is correct. The buyer's claim that the seller breached the contract by refusing to perform is a claim for total breach. The buyer can treat the claim as one for anticipatory breach only if, by notifying the seller that the buyer was ready to perform but the seller refused to perform his side of the contract, the buyer at any time prior to the agreed time for performance of the contract was ready and willing to perform, and the seller's refusal to perform caused the buyer economic harm. See also UCC 2-711(1). The seller's refusal to perform after the buyer tendered performance is an affirmative defense. UCC 2-714. Thus, D is incorrect. The issue here is whether the buyer was ready and willing to perform on the agreed time for performance. A is incorrect. It is not a constructive condition that must be satisfied before the duty to perform under a contract may be required. B is incorrect. The fact that the buyer did not tender the performance on the specified date does not constitute a material breach. A non-material breach is one that does not go to the very root of the contract, or one that does not completely deprive the other party of what the contract created. The seller's failure to perform on the specified date is not a material breach. C is correct. A party's breach of a contractual obligation may be either material or immaterial. A material breach is a breach that goes to the very root of the contract, or one that completely deprives the other party of what the contract created. A non-material breach is one that does not go to the very root of the contract, or one that does not completely deprive the other party of what the contract created. The seller's failure to tender performance on the agreed time is not a material breach."

Here the mill's tender of less than the contracted-for quantity did not amount to a nonconformity that substantially impaired either the value of the 16th installment or the whole contract. The mill's proposed cure, the delivery of the remaining 200 pounds on the following Monday, is sufficient given that the late delivery and the shortage will not significantly disrupt the bakery's business.

            "chosen_option_label": "C",
            "explanation": "C is correct. The doctrine of conditionality allows parties to create contingent obligations where one party's duty to perform is conditioned upon the occurrence of a specified act or event. A condition is a term that requires further conduct by the obligor, in addition to mere promise making, as an element of the obligation of the promise. If the condition is not satisfied, the promisee may treat the promise as disaffirmed. A condition may be either certain or uncertain. A certain condition is one that, by its nature, requires further conduct of an objective standard, and whose satisfaction, by its nature, cannot be foreshadowed or anticipated. An uncertain condition is one that, by its nature, requires further conduct that is not of an objective standard, or whose satisfaction, by its nature, can be foreshadowed or anticipated. An obligor's duty under a condition may be discharged (i) upon occurrence of the condition, (ii) automatically if the condition occurs, or (iii) non-occurrence of the condition will discharge the obligation only upon the option of the promisee. Here, the court is likely to find the buyer in breach because the condition (that the buyer obtain mortgage financing) did not occur, it was an uncertain condition, and the buyer's obligation to purchase the house was discharged when the buyer stated that he was unable to get financing. A is incorrect because the condition was not satisfied, so the contract was discharged. B is incorrect because the obligation was not illusory since there was a duty to obtain mortgage financing, and the buyer was required to take reasonable steps to obtain it. D is incorrect because the determination of whether the buyer had an obligation to purchase the house for $250,000 within 30 days is a question of fact, not of law, and therefore, the answer should not be provided."

A court will not treat the failure to perform as a breach where the other party's material change has resulted in the impossibility of performance. The performer's best defense is that her legal relationship with the producer has materially changed in a way that makes it impossible for her to perform the remainder of the tour. The fact that a year earlier the performer was incapacitated by the same stomach disorder that kept her in the hospital for the first three days of the tour is important evidence that the impossibility of performance has materially changed the legal relationship between the parties. The fact that the actor was a better actor than the performer is not relevant to this defense. Nor is the fact that the producer was unable to find a suitable replacement relevant. Nor is it a defense that the producer offered to hire the performer as the actor's understudy. The fact that the performer refused the offer does not make the producer's performance due.

Circumstances that would give the producer the right to cancel the contract include the degree of uncertainty relating to the nature and duration of the performer's illness and the extent to which a delay in making substitute arrangements would have prevented the producer from continuing the tour.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA businesswoman sold her business to a company for $25 million in cash pursuant to a written contract that was signed by both parties.

The businesswoman had a reasonable expectation of being retained for the next two years, so the company cannot waive its obligation to retain her. Instead, the businesswoman has a right to recover damages for the company's breach of the employment term. She can recover damages for the remainder of the two-year period if she was fired without cause, and she remains ready to work.

On June 22, the school informed the teacher that, due to a change in its planned math curriculum, it no longer needed a full-time math teacher. The school offered instead to employ the teacher as a part-time academic counselor at a salary of $20,000, starting in September. The teacher refused the school's offer.

B is incorrect. The school's offer to hire the teacher as an academic counselor is not a reasonable substitute for the math teaching services the school had promised.
