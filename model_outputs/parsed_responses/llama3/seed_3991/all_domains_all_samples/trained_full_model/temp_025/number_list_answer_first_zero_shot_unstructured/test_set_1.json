            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The court only looks to where the company is incorporated and where it is incorporated are not the same as where it distributes its cars. B is incorrect. This choice refers to personal jurisdiction, which is irrelevant to determining if there is diversity jurisdiction. There are two methods to establish diversity jurisdiction: (1) diversity of citizenship or (2) diversity of citizenship combined with minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. C is correct. The court will look at where the company is incorporated and where its headquarters is located are likely to be the same. D is incorrect. The court will only look to where the company is incorporated and where it is incorporated are not the same as where it has major manufacturing facilities."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The complaint set out the bank\u2019s method of calculating interest and alleged that the method violated both federal banking law and state contract law. The bank filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that its method of calculating interest, as described in the complaint, was proper under federal law and that the federal law preempted the depositor\u2019s state-law claim. The court granted the motion to dismiss the depositor\u2019s federal claim and reserved ruling on the motion to dismiss the state-law claim. After completing discovery, the bank has moved to dismiss the state-law claim for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court may hear the state-law claim, because it is so related to the federal claim that they form part of the same case or controversy.\nB. The court must hear the state-law claim, because it is so related to the federal claim that they form part of the same case or controversy.\nC.

            "explanation": "A is correct. When a federal court determines that it has dismissed less than all of a plaintiff's federal claims, it must determine whether the remaining federal claim is so related to the federal claims that were dismissed that they form part of the same case or controversy. If they are, the federal court has supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claim and may hear the state law claim. Here, the federal claim and the state claim are related in that they both arise out of the bank's calculation of interest, which was the basis of the depositor's legal challenge. B is incorrect. Although it is true that the state and federal claims here arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, a federal court must make a determination of whether the claims form part of the same case or controversy before it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claim. C is incorrect. The bank did not raise a federal defense to the state claim; rather, it raised a preemption argument, which is not a federal defense. In order for a defense to extend federal jurisdiction, the defense must arise out of a federal statute and the defense must not be a defense to the state law claim, but rather a defense that transforms the case into a federal case. If a defense is not of this type, it is not a federal defense and does not arise under the judicial power of the United States. D is incorrect. The jurisdictional minimum applies only to cases arising solely under federal law, not to cases arising under federal and state law. Here, the depositor's claim arises under both federal and state law, so the jurisdictional minimum does not apply."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

When the second defendant was joined, the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint asserted a federal claim. However, for diversity jurisdiction, all parties must be diverse at the time of the filing of the complaint or, if not diverse at that time, diversity must be achieved within 30 days. Since the plaintiff did not assert a federal claim at the time the second defendant was joined, the parties were not diverse and removal was not proper. B is correct. For removal jurisdiction, all parties must be diverse at the time of the filing of the complaint or, if not diverse at that time, diversity must be achieved within 30 days. Here, the plaintiff did not assert a federal claim at the time the second defendant was joined, the parties were not diverse and removal was not proper. C is incorrect. The diversity jurisdiction of the federal court requires that no party in interest shall be a citizen of the State in which the court is held. Here, for removal jurisdiction, all parties must be diverse at the time of the filing of the complaint or, if not diverse at that time, diversity must be achieved within 30 days.

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h) permits litigants to raise personal-jurisdiction challenges for the first time in an answer that is amended as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1). Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants.

Failure to do so will result in the automatic dismissal of a party's claim. Here, the plaintiff failed to effect proper service of process on the defendant, which is a requirement under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12. As such, the court should deny the motion. B is incorrect. The failure to file proof of service does not warrant dismissal of a party's claim. Instead, dismissal is warranted only if a party fails to properly serve process, as is required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 12. C is incorrect. The 60-day period for waiver does not apply to this situation. Here, the plaintiff did not waive service on the defendant and instead relied on the defendant returning the signed waiver request, answer, or otherwise plead. The proper method to apply is the regular service process, which requires that service be made within 121 days after the complaint is filed. Only 21 days are allowed for service after the complaint is mailed to the party to be served. Here, the complaint was filed on the same day as the notice of the complaint and two copies of a request to waive service were mailed to the defendant, allowing only 21 days for service to be made. Therefore, service was not made in a timely sufficient manner and the court should deny the motion. D is incorrect.

Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

For diversity actions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a) provides that venue is proper in (1) where any defendant is found, (2) where any defendant has a home state or residence, or (3) where any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced. Here, the railroad is from State B, so the railroad has a home state of State B, and under \u00a7 1391(a)(2), venue is proper in State B. Therefore, D is the best argument in support of a motion to transfer for venue reasons. A is incorrect. For forum non conveniens reasons, the railroad would argue that the accident occurring in State B and many witnesses being located there would be a proper factor to consider in determining the motion to transfer. However, for venue reasons, the court must transfer the action to State B because that is where the railroad is subject to personal jurisdiction, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a) provides that venue is proper in State B. B is incorrect. While this would be a factor to consider in a forum non conveniens analysis, it is not a basis to grant a motion to transfer for venue reasons. C is incorrect.

Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

In describing the events that led to the false accusations, the complaint quoted a statement of a competitor made to the employer about the worker\u2019s alleged theft. During discovery, the worker deposed the competitor. One week after discovery closed, the worker moved to amend the complaint to add the competitor as a defendant. The competitor opposed the motion on the ground that the statutory limitations period had expired. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery has closed, and the competitor will be prejudiced.\nB. No, because the amendment would not relate back and thus would be futile.\nC. Yes, because leave to amend should be freely granted when the underlying action was timely.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. Here, the worker filed her initial complaint within the applicable statute of limitations. The worker\u2019s motion to amend and add the competitor as a defendant relates back to the original complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(A) because the initial complaint alleged defamation based on statements the competitor made to the employer. Therefore, the motion to amend is not untimely under Rule 15(c) and discovery having closed is not a valid basis to oppose the motion. B is incorrect. As explained above, the worker\u2019s motion to amend and add the competitor as a defendant relates back to the original complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(A) because the initial complaint alleged defamation based on statements the competitor made to the employer. Therefore, the motion to amend is not futile and answering the complaint or defending against the worker\u2019s claim will not be materially prejudiced. C is incorrect. Although Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) states that \"leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires,\" the worker\u2019s motion to amend and add the competitor as a defendant relates back to the original complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(A) because the initial complaint alleged defamation based on statements the competitor made to the employer. D is correct.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Courts may deny leave to amend when the claim to be added is futile. Here, the claim is futile on limitations grounds unless relation back applies. Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.",

The manufacturer\u2019s attorney proposed an instruction that the jury should not return a verdict for the consumer if it found that the consumer had been contributorily negligent.

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC.

Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect.

Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), the court is to apply whatever law would be applied by the courts of the state in which the district court is sitting. Answer B is incorrect. In Klaxon, the US Supreme Court ruled that in cases governed by Erie, the court is to apply whatever law would be applied by the courts of the state in which the district court is sitting, not simply forum law. Answer C is incorrect. Under Erie, the fact that the action is in federal court does not create a right to apply federal law, and state substantive law governs. Answer D is incorrect.

The complaint alleged that the fire had been caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the house\u2019s electrical system in accordance with the applicable housing code. The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent. In opposition to that motion, the tenant argues that under federal law, contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defendant who wishes to assert the defense must plead in an answer or other responsive pleading. Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB. Federal law, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control pleading in federal court.\nC. State law, because the application of federal law would be outcome-determinative.\nD.

P. 8(c) that contributor negligence is an affirmative defense means that the landlord will need to plead that defense in his answer, not in a motion to dismiss. Therefore, the court should deny the motion to dismiss. A is incorrect. Here, the federal law governing pleadings is substantive, but it does not require that the landlord raise his only defense to the tenant\u2019s claim in a motion to dismiss. Instead, the federal law allows the landlord to plead his defense in an answer. C and D are incorrect. Here, federal law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss, not state law."

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. When a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure is valid and on point, it controls over a conflicting state rule. Rule 8(c)(1) is on point because it specifically provides that contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defending party must assert in its answer to the complaint. The rule is a valid exercise of the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power, because the manner of pleading defenses is an issue that can rationally be classified as procedure and the rule itself regulates the manner and means by which the parties\u2019 rights are enforced. Answer A is incorrect. The question of who has the burden of pleading, in contrast to the burden of proof, in federal actions is a procedural matter within the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power. Answer C is incorrect. The \u201coutcome determinative\u201d test applies only when asking whether a state rule that conflicts with a judge-made federal practice should be followed.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The broker\u2019s ability to join his contract claim as a counterclaim is governed by federal procedure, not state law. B is correct. To join a claim as a counterclaim, the counterclaim must be: (1) timely, and (2) based on a compulsory counterclaim. A compulsory counterclaim is one that: (i) \"arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action,\" and (ii) \"does not require addition of a new party to the action for its adjudication.\" Here, the broker's breach of contract claim does not arise out of the transaction or occurrence that is at the heart of the investor's federal securities law action, so the broker's claim is not a compulsory counterclaim. Instead, the broker's claim would be a permissive counterclaim, which can be asserted \"so long as it is timely.\" However, a permissive counterclaim must be asserted within 30 days after the first set of counterclaims is served, so the broker has missed that deadline as well. C is incorrect for the reasons stated above. D is incorrect. The broker's breach of contract claim does not meet the requirements of a compulsory counterclaim, but this does not mean that the claim may be asserted as a permissive counterclaim. As stated above, the broker has failed to assert his permissive counterclaim timely, so the claim cannot be joined."

The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

The writ of habeas corpus is a writ of original jurisdiction for both federal and state courts, which means that any court can issue it and that it does not automatically go to the trial court. However, the writ can only be issued by a court that has jurisdiction over the case and the parties. In this case, the governor is in federal custody, and so a federal court would be the appropriate court to issue the writ. However, any court can issue a writ of habeas corpus, so the question is whether the state court or the federal court would be the proper court to issue the writ. The court that issued the writ is the court that has jurisdiction over the case and the parties. In this case, the state judge is issuing the writ against the director of the lockup facility, who is in a federal custody facility and is working for the federal government. Therefore, the federal court would be the proper court to issue the writ. But, any court can issue a writ of habeas corpus, so the question is whether the state court or the federal court has jurisdiction over the case and the parties. B is correct. Federal courts have original jurisdiction over all matters arising under the Constitution, as well as over all matters arising from federal laws. However, in this case, the state court is issuing the writ against the director of the lockup facility, who is working for the federal government and is in a federal custody facility holding the governor, who is in federal custody. The state court does not have jurisdiction over the case and the parties, and so the writ is invalid. A is incorrect. Federal courts have original jurisdiction over all matters arising under the Constitution, as well as over all matters arising from federal laws. The state court is issuing the writ against the director of the lockup facility, who is working for the federal government and is in a federal custody facility holding the governor, who is in federal custody.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The daughter's lawsuit does not violate the freedom of the press clause of the First Amendment because the daughter is not a state actor and therefore her lawsuit does not amount to state action. To establish a First Amendment violation, the daughter's lawsuit would have to constitute state action, and an individual private citizen or businessperson does not become a state actor simply by filing a lawsuit under a state law. Thus, A is incorrect. B is correct. The First Amendment does not shield reporters from generally applicable state-law claims. The Supreme Court has held that a state law that generally applies in the absence of First Amendment concerns will not violate the freedom of the press clause of the First Amendment simply because it affects a newspaper. Thus, the fact that the daughter is seeking to enforce a breach-of-contract claim under generally applicable state contract law does not mean that her lawsuit violates the First Amendment. C is incorrect. This response letter incorrectly states the test that the court would apply to determine whether the daughter's lawsuit violates the First Amendment. In fact, the test is whether the state law imposes a prior restraint on speech or whether the law subjects press operations to government approval or disapproval. In the event that a court finds that a state law does impose a prior restraint on speech or subjects press operations to government approval or disapproval, the court would then apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the law is constitutionally valid. However, if the state law does not impose a prior restraint or subject press operations to government approval or disapproval, then the court would apply a more lenient test to determine whether the law is constitutionally valid. D is incorrect. The first amendment does not exempt public figures or public information from its protections. The freedom of the press clause of the First Amendment protects all speech and press operations, whether they pertain to public figures or public information or not."

The statute authorizes the President to appoint the agency\u2019s director with the advice and consent of the Senate and prohibits the President from removing the director without the Senate\u2019s consent. The President appointed a director, and the Senate confirmed the appointment. Recently, the President has become dissatisfied with the director\u2019s strict approach to drug-law enforcement and wishes to remove the director. Because a majority of senators favor strict drug-law enforcement, the Senate has refused to consent to the director\u2019s removal. May the President constitutionally remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director\u2019s appointment and removal.\nB. No, because the President\u2019s removal of principal officers of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\nC. Yes, because congressional participation in the decision to remove a presidential appointee violates the separation of powers.\nD. Yes, because Congress cannot limit the ability of the President to remove any employee of the executive branch.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

Congress has the power to appoint agents of the executive branch with the advice and consent of the Senate under Article I, Section 8, Clause 18, which gives Congress the power to make all necessary and proper rules and regulations for the execution of its laws. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that the President may remove principal officers with the advice and consent of the Senate, but it does not preclude the President from removing other agents of the executive branch. Therefore, Congress may create positions that are not principal offices that the President may remove without Senate approval. B is incorrect because the President may remove agents of the executive branch without the Senate's approval as long as those agents are not principal officers. C is incorrect because congressional participation in the decision to remove a presidential appointee does not violate the separation of powers as long as the Congress is not removing a principal officer. A is incorrect because Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 gives Congress the power to appoint agents of the executive branch with the advice and consent of the Senate, but the fact that Congress is exercising that power does not mean that Congress may limit the President's ability to remove those agents."

Myers and subsequent cases make it clear that the Senate has no role in the removal of federal officers other than via impeachment. Answer D is incorrect because it is an overbroad statement of the law.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right.

Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard.

But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect. It states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not applicable in this case. The state sterilization requirement would receive strict judicial scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation.",

On numerous occasions, the wife\u2019s brother had offered to buy the farm from her, but she had always refused. The husband died suddenly in an accident. The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children. What would be the wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Duress.\nB. Mistake.\nC. Unconscionability.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The brother took advantage of the wife\u2019s vulnerable state to get her to agree to sell the farm. The wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract is that it was the product of undue influence. Under the doctrine of undue influence, a court may find a contract voidable by a party if that party was in a vulnerable position and if the other party took advantage of that vulnerability to obtain the contract. The vulnerable party must also have a lack of independent advice and lack of knowledge on key terms of the agreement. The husband\u2019s death created a vulnerable situation for the wife, and the brother took advantage of that situation by not disclosing the existence of the life insurance policy and by obtaining the contract on short notice from his attorney. Therefore, the wife\u2019s strongest argument is based on undue influence. A is incorrect. Duress requires a threat of unlawful force, and there is no evidence that the brother threatened the wife with unlawful force. B is incorrect. A mistake must relate to a basic assumption of the contract that has been destroyed. The wife\u2019s mistake was not a basic assumption of the contract, since she knew she was selling the farm. C is incorrect. A contract may be unconscionable at the time that it is made, but a court will not rescind a contract on unconscionability grounds if the unconscionability has been waived by the losing party. Here, the wife waived any unconscionability when she sold the farm by signing the offer to purchase."

Here, the client's email to the attorney was an offer to contract that was open for a reasonable time. The offer was not revocable once the attorney began performance, because to do so would have caused the attorney undue hardship. In general, a offer will not be found to cause undue hardship where the offeree has not yet received notice of the offer, or where the offeree can retrieve notice that has already been given. Here, the client's offer caused no hardship because the attorney failed to notify the client that he had begun performance. However, once the attorney did notify the client that he had already completed the work, any attempt by the client to revoke his offer would cause undue hardship on the attorney. Therefore, the offer was irrevocable, and a contract was formed when the attorney began working on the requested opinion. A is incorrect. The attorney's failure to notify the client that he had begun work on the opinion request did not negate the client's offer to contract. Because the offer was for a reasonable time and was not revocable due to the attorney's lack of notice, the client's revocation attempt caused undue hardship and the offer remained open. B is incorrect. The client's offer to contract was for a reasonable time, and because the client made no attempt to notify the attorney of his intention to revoke his offer for a reasonable time, the offer was irrevocable. C is correct. An offer is for a reasonable time, or until the offeror says otherwise, invitation to accept.

An offer is not irrevocable simply because a reasonable time has passed, and the client's offer to contract was revocable here. Additionally, while it is true that an offer may be accepted by performance, here the client had not given notice of his intention to revoke his offer.

The appraiser told the heir that he had no expertise in appraising art and recommended that she hire an art appraiser to value the painting. The heir, doubting that the painting was valuable, declined to follow the appraiser\u2019s advice and decided to sell the painting at a yard sale. She set the price at $100, assuming that this price reflected the painting\u2019s approximate value. A neighbor, who knew nothing about art, purchased the painting from the heir at the asking price. The neighbor and the heir later discovered that the painting was worth over $900,000. Would the heir be likely to prevail in an action to rescind the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the heir bore the risk of any mistake as to the true value of the painting.\nB. No, because the neighbor possessed no specialized knowledge of the true value of the painting.\nC.

Where a party's mistake relates to a material aspect of the contract, and the mistake renders enforcement of the contract unconscionable, that party may avoid the contract. Here, the heir's mistake as to the value of the painting relates to a material aspect of the contract, and enforcement of the contract would have an extremely disadvantageous impact on her. Therefore, she may avoid the contract on grounds of unconscionability. To determine whether enforcement of a contract would be unconscionable, the court considers whether the terms of the contract are unreasonably favorable to one of the parties. In determining whether the terms of a contract are unreasonably favorable to a party, the court considers the then-existing circumstances surrounding the contract's formation, including the facts and circumstances surrounding the mistake. Therefore, the court would not require the heir to meet the test for avoiding a contract on grounds of mutual mistake, and A is incorrect. Additionally, while the neighbor may have had no specialized knowledge of the painting's value, the court may find enforcement of the contract unconscionable even if the other party did not have knowledge of the mistake. Therefore, B is correct, and D is incorrect. C is incorrect because the contract would not be unconscionable at the time of enforcement but rather at the time of formation."

            "explanation": "D is correct. Under the UCC, payment obligations are conditioned upon the occurrence of express conditions. Failure to satisfy an express condition allows a party to withhold payment. However, the failure of an express condition is excused whenever the occurrence of the condition is prevented by the fault of the party obligated to satisfy the condition, or is waived by such party, or is subject to an express duty of performance not consistent with the failure to occur. Here, the engineer completed the feasibility study and the master plan and used his best efforts to obtain approval of the project. The engineer did not breach the contract, and therefore the developer\u2019s payment obligation is no longer conditioned upon the occurrence of the condition of approval. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answer B is incorrect. A is incorrect because the condition of approval of the project was excused by the fault of the developer. Even if the failure of the condition were not excused, failure of an express condition to occur excuses a party's obligation to pay. Therefore, the developer did not withhold payment due to the failure of the condition to occur; instead, he withheld payment because the condition failed to occur.

Later that day, before the firm told the subcontractor of the award, the subcontractor told the firm that it was withdrawing its bid because it had recently undertaken a new project that would absorb all its capacity for the next 18 months. The firm nevertheless accepted the subcontractor\u2019s bid and demanded that it perform the electrical work on the plant, but the subcontractor refused.

Therefore, the subcontractor was free to revoke its bid at any time prior to the time that the firm accepted the bid, and the firm has no rights against the subcontractor. A is incorrect because the firm has no basis for a recovery of damages against the subcontractor. B is incorrect because the firm did not detrimentally rely on the subcontractor\u2019s bid. The firm would have been required bid assurance (e.g. by obtaining a signed writing from the subcontractor) in order to provide a legal basis for a recovery of damages against the subcontractor. C is incorrect because a bid is not considered a promise that will be legally enforced, and is revocable at any time prior to acceptance."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

In return for his daughter\u2019s promise to pay $300,000 to his nephew at the time of the father\u2019s death, the father executed and delivered to his daughter a quitclaim deed to the land. The daughter took possession of the land. Two years later, in a signed writing, the father directed his daughter to pay to a neighbor, at the father\u2019s death, $50,000 of the $300,000 that was to go to the nephew. The daughter, who had long disliked the neighbor, told her father that she did not plan to honor his request. The father died, and his daughter has since refused to pay anything to either the nephew or the neighbor. The neighbor has sued the daughter for the $50,000. Is the neighbor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter did not consent to any modification of the contract she had made with her father.\nB. No, because the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, and the nephew\u2019s interest could not be modified without his express written consent.\nC. Yes, because the father retained a transferable interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise.\nD. Yes, because the father\u2019s signed modification is enforceable without consideration.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

            "explanation": "Under the common law, a parent cannot assign their rights under an existing contract, nor can they unilaterally modify an existing contract to which they are a party. In recognition of the unique relationship between a parent and child, many states apply a more liberal approach to contracts between parents and children. Under this approach, a parent's retention of a future interest in their child's promise is sufficient to make the promise enforceable. Therefore, answer C is correct. Answer A is incorrect because many states allow parents to unilaterally modify contracts with their children. Answer B is incorrect because the nephew was only a intended beneficiary, not an expressed third party beneficiary. In order to enforce a right as an intended beneficiary, the nephew would have had to bring suit against his uncle within a reasonable time after his uncle's death. Answer D is incorrect because the modification of a contract requires consideration."

Here, the daughter did not agree to the modification and the father provided no consideration. Answer B is incorrect. Even though the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, the nephew\u2019s consent was not required for modification unless the contract provided otherwise. Here, however, there was no modification of the contract, because the daughter did not agree to it. Answer C is incorrect. The father retained no interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise, and thus he could not alter her obligation without her consent. Answer D is incorrect. There was no effective modification, because the daughter did not agree to it. Furthermore, the general common law rule is that a modification requires consideration, and here there was no consideration from the father.",

The notice had been placed by the homeowner\u2019s cousin without the homeowner\u2019s knowledge. The cousin bore a grudge against the homeowner and had placed the notice while the homeowner was away and had left the door to the home unlocked.

Without a legal duty, the company cannot be held liable for the cousin\u2019s actions. B is incorrect. The cousin\u2019s actions were not, as a matter of law, a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. It is possible that the homeowner would have lost the same furnishings even if the company had not posted the notice. However, the company had no duty in the first place to screen users or the content of their postings, so the company cannot be held liable for the cousin\u2019s actions. C is incorrect. The First Amendment protects companies and individuals from being held liable for injurious behavior that was caused solely by their speech. However, the First Amendment does not protect companies and individuals from being held liable for negligent or other tortious behavior that is not caused by their speech. In this case, the company had no duty to screen users or the content of their postings, so the company cannot be held liable for the cousin\u2019s actions. D is incorrect.

The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

The motorcycle hit a tire that had fallen off a truck driven by a delivery company employee who was making a delivery to an address on the private road. The boy was injured when his motorcycle went out of control after striking the tire. In a negligence action brought on behalf of the boy against the delivery company, the company contends that the boy was contributorily negligent and that his damages, if any, should be reduced in conformance with the jurisdiction\u2019s comparative negligence statute. The boy argues that his conduct should be judged according to the standard of a reasonable child of like age, intelligence, and experience under the circumstances. Is the boy entitled to be judged according to the standard of care that he has argued for?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the boy was driving a motorcycle.\nB.

The boy was a minor at the time of the incident, and he will be held to the reasonable person standard of care applicable to children of his age, intelligence, and experience only. A is incorrect. The fact that the boy was driving a motorcycle does not determine the standard of care that will be applied to him, although it may be considered in determining whether he met that standard. B is incorrect. The fact that the boy was a trespasser also does not determine the standard of care that will be applied to him, although it may be considered in determining whether he met that standard. If the boy had been an adult trespasser, the fact that he was a trespasser would support a finding of contributory negligence. However, because the boy was a minor, he will be held to the reasonable person standard of care applicable to children of his age, intelligence, and experience, and not to the strict standard of an adult trespasser. C is incorrect. The application of comparative negligence does not determine the standard of care that a plaintiff must meet in order to prevail in his action. Instead, it determines how the negligence of a plaintiff will affect his recovery in cases where he has been injured by more than one negligent party. In this case, the boy's recovery from the delivery company will not be reduced to the extent that he was himself negligent, as long as that negligence was not greater than the negligence of the delivery company. However, the standard of care that the boy must meet in order to prevail in his action is the reasonable person standard of care applicable to children of his age, intelligence, and experience."

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB. No, because the former employee could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts.\nC.

After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The United States Supreme Court has held that, at a minimum, a punitive damages award must be proportionate to the harm caused by the defendant's actions, and that awards that are too large are constitutionally excessive. While there is not a hard and fast limit on the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, the Supreme Court has held that a 400:1 ratio is constitutionally excessive. In addition, the Supreme Court has indicated that, in general, punitive damages awards should be limited to something comparable to the actual damages in the case where there is no evidence of the defendant's wealth or income. In this case, a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally excessive. Therefore, A is incorrect. B is incorrect. The mere fact that the plaintiff died as a result of the defendant's actions does not mean that the plaintiff's family is entitled to a punitive damages award. Instead, the plaintiff's family would need to show that the defendant's actions were egregious in order to support a punitive damages award. For this reason, C is correct. It is true that a plaintiff must show the defendant was intentionally wronged in order to receive punitive damages. D is incorrect. Even if the patient's smoking were found to be contributorily negligent, this would only reduce the patient's recovery by a amount allocated to the patient's own fault. It would not wipe out the patient's claim for wrongful death, or eliminate the potential for a punitive damage award against the radiologist."

As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

Frightened, a passenger pried the inside doors open and impulsively stuck his arm through them to try to stop the fall. As a result, his arm was broken. The elevator eventually stopped without causing further injuries. In a negligence action brought by the injured passenger against the company that installed and maintained the elevator, the injured passenger has asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that it may find the company negligent on a theory of res ipsa loquitur. In response, the company has argued that the passenger\u2019s conduct caused his injuries. How should the judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The judge should deny the passenger\u2019s request, because it is possible that the company was not negligent.\nB. The judge should deny the passenger\u2019s request, because the jury could find that the conduct of the passenger contributed to his injuries.\nC.

Here, the passenger intervened by sticking his arm out to try to stop the fall of the elevator, which the jury could find was an action that contributed to his injuries. Because the passenger's own actions may have caused his injury, the passenger will not be allowed to give the res ipsa loquitur instruction. A is incorrect. Res ipsa loquitur does not require a showing of negligence on the part of the defendant; it merely raises an inference of negligence. Therefore, it is not necessary that the jury find the company was negligent. C is incorrect. When giving the res ipsa loquitur instruction, the judge need not also instruct the jury to consider any carelessness on the part of the plaintiff. D is incorrect. The reasonableness of the passenger's actions are irrelevant to the determination of whether res ipsa loquitur should be given.

On the day he arrived, just after sunset, he took his bag upstairs to a second-floor bedroom and unpacked. As he was about to head back downstairs, he realized that the stairwell had become too dark to navigate without a light. The man spent about 30 seconds feeling the walls at the top of the stairwell but could not find a light switch. In fact, the switch was located in an awkward position not reachable without descending to the second step. Although he recognized the danger of descending an unfamiliar staircase in darkness, the man started down the stairs. He lost his footing halfway down, fell, and was seriously injured. The man has sued the owner of the beach house for negligence. The jurisdiction recognizes the traditional common law defense of assumption of risk. If the action proceeds to trial, which of the following would be an appropriate (paraphrased) instruction for the court to give to the jury?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling on the darkened stairs, then you must assign a percentage of responsibility to the man.\u201d\nB. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling on the darkened stairs, then you must find for the owner.\u201d\nC. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man was a mere licensee, then you must find for the owner.\u201d\nD. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, then you may in your discretion award the man both compensatory and punitive damages.\u201d\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

            "explanation": "A is correct. The instruction in A appropriately addresses the issue of comparative negligence as it applies to the man's assumption of risk. The jury must determine the extent to which the owner was negligent in failing to light the stairway and the extent to which the man assumed the risk of descending the unlit stairs. The jury must also determine whether the man's assumption of the risk was a cause in fact and a legal cause of his injury. If the man's assumption of risk was a cause in fact of his injury, the jury must then determine the extent to which the man's assumption of risk was a responsible cause of his injury. B is incorrect. It incorrectly states that assumption of risk is a complete bar to recovery. C is incorrect. The licensees' doctrine has been largely replaced by modern rules of comparative negligence and assumption of risk. In any event, even if the man were a mere licensee, he would not automatically lose. Instead, the owner would only owe him the duty to make reasonable inspections to inform the man of any hidden dangers. The jury would then determine whether the owner had met his duty. In doing so, the jury would determine whether the owner's failure to put up the light constituted negligence that was a cause in fact and a legal cause of the man's injury. D is incorrect. A landowner's duty to exercise reasonable care does not give a tenant, or any guest for that matter, the right to receive punitive damages."

            "explanation": "D is correct. To prevail in an intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant's behavior was extreme and outrageous, (2) that the defendant acted intentionally with the intent to cause the plaintiff emotional distress, (3) that the plaintiff was emotionally distressed as a result of the defendant's behavior, and (4) that the defendant's behavior caused the plaintiff's emotional distress. Therefore, extreme and outrageous behavior is required for IIED, making D the best answer. A is incorrect. While the debt collector should have foreseen that his actions would cause some type of harm to the woman, IIED does not require that the defendant foresee the specific harm that will occur. Rather, the defendant must have acted with the intent to cause emotional distress. B is incorrect. The woman need not fear that the debt collector will physically attack her; rather, the IIED claim is for the emotional distress that she has already suffered as a result of the debt collector\u2019s actions. C is incorrect. The debt collector's conduct need not fail to comply with industry custom in order for the woman to prevail in her IIED claim."

None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman\u2019s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.   Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The spectator was hit by a rocket that was intended to be fired as part of the amusement park's fireworks display. Because the rocket was fired intentionally by the amusement park, and because the spectator was hit by the rocket, the amusement park could be liable for battery. A battery is an unlawful application of force to the person resulting in bodily injury. The force need not be overt, and can be caused by a thing, such as the rocket in this fact pattern. Therefore, B is correct. A is incorrect because the amusement park's activity, a fireworks display, is not unusual enough to be considered abnormally dangerous. Whether an activity is abnormally dangerous will turn on whether the activity is unusual enough to be beyond the ordinary capacity of an average person to evaluate and protect against the risk of harm. Therefore, A is incorrect. C is incorrect because the amusement park's activity was a use of neighboring land that was not a nuisance before the spectator was struck. Whether an activity is a nuisance will turn on whether the activity is interfering with the use and enjoyment of neighboring land. Therefore, C is incorrect. D is incorrect because strict products liability applies to the manufacture of products that are expected to, and in fact, do, encounter the consumer on their own.

Answer B is incorrect. The spectator was injured in an accident: the amusement park did not intend to touch the spectator in a harmful or offensive manner, as is required for battery liability. Answer C is incorrect. The spectator suffered personal injuries. The tort of nuisance imposes liability for unreasonable interference with another person\u2019s use or enjoyment of their property.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Private nuisance focuses on whether the defendant's activity has caused an interference with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of his or her land. This interference is judged against a reasonableness standard, taking into account such factors as the nature of the neighborhood, the value of the plaintiff's land, and whether the defendant's use can be considered ordinary and usual. Therefore, if the farmer can establish that unsightly conditions are not unreasonable and do not amount to an interference with the homeowner's use and enjoyment of her land, he will be able to avoid a finding of liability for private nuisance. A is incorrect because a showing of monetary damage to property is not required for a claim of private nuisance. Instead, the plaintiff must show an interference with the use and enjoyment of his or her property. B is incorrect because a private nuisance claim does not require physical invasion of the plaintiff's property. Instead, the plaintiff must show an interference with the use and enjoyment of his or her property. C is incorrect because what is considered ordinary and usual land use (and therefore, not unreasonable) is judged in light of the neighborhood at issue. Therefore, the fact that keeping old equipment on land visible to neighbors is unusual among area farmers is irrelevant if the plaintiff's property is not located in an area where such use is common."

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value.

Here, the defendant objected to the introduction of the rival\u2019s statement as hearsay. However, the defendant\u2019s right to object to the rival\u2019s statement as hearsay would be forfeited if the defendant killed the rival as the result of the rival\u2019s theft of money from the defendant, because the objection would be forfeited based on the defendant\u2019s intent to prevent the rival from testifying to the theft. But the defendant would not forfeit his right to object to the rival\u2019s statement as hearsay if the defendant killed the rival for reasons unrelated to the rival\u2019s statement. In contrast, when a hearsay statement is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement - in this case, that the defendant planned to kill the rival - but rather to prove that the rival knew that the defendant planned to kill him, there is no right under Rule 106 to introduce relevant evidence to prove that the rival knew that the defendant planned to kill him. In that situation, the defendant would not forfeit his right to object to the rival\u2019s statement on confrontation grounds by killing the rival, because there is no right under Rule 106 that would be forfeited in that situation. However, the defendant would forfeit his right to object to the rival\u2019s statement as hearsay if, but only if, the prosecutor can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant killed the rival as the result of the rival\u2019s theft of money from the defendant and thus with the intent to prevent the rival from testifying to the theft.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection.

Under FRE 701, the stockholder\u2019s testimony is inadmissible.   Answer B is incorrect. If otherwise qualified, an expert witness can have a personal interest in the outcome of the action and still testify. The expert\u2019s personal interest can be explored on cross-examination. In this case, however, the stockholder is not qualified as an expert. Answer C is incorrect. An admissible opinion about the cause of the price drop cannot be based on the stockholder\u2019s perception; it requires an expertise that he does not possess. His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue. Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 701, property owners are entitled to express opinions on the value of their property, but here the stockholder is expressing an opinion on the cause of the publicly traded stock\u2019s price drop.

The defendant\u2019s attorney objects. Is the woman\u2019s statement to the police officer admissible to prove that the defendant sold cocaine?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the prosecutor has not shown that the woman\u2019s attendance at trial could not have been procured through process or other reasonable means.\nC.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The woman\u2019s statement to the police officer that she had obtained the cocaine from the defendant is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that the defendant sold cocaine to the woman. Therefore, it is hearsay. The woman's statement does not meet the requirements of any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Although the woman had first-hand knowledge of the cocaine sale, her statement is still hearsay when offered against the defendant. The defendant's attorney should object to the statement's being offered into evidence, but the objection should be based on the ground that the statement is hearsay for which there is no exception. Answer B is incorrect because it refers to the unavailability of a hearsay declarant, which is only relevant to determining whether a hearsay statement can be admitted under the hearsay exception for statements that are not made while the declarant is expecting or intending to be called as a witness. As stated above, the woman's statement to the police officer is inadmissible hearsay. The woman's unavailability to testify at trial would not make the hearsay statement admissible. Answer C is incorrect because it refers to the hearsay exception for statements by a co-conspirator against interest. As stated above, the woman's statement to the police officer is inadmissible hearsay. In order for a hearsay statement to be admissible under the co-conspirator exception, the statement must be made during the course of the conspiracy and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The woman's statement to the police officer was made after she had been arrested and was made in an effort to shift blame to the defendant. Therefore, the woman's statement would not be admissible under the co-conspirator exception. Although the woman's statement may be admissible under the co-conspirator exception at the woman's trial for selling cocaine, it would not be admissible under that exception at the defendant's trial. Answer D is incorrect because it refers to the hearsay exception for statements of a party opponent. As stated above, the woman's statement to the police officer is inadmissible hearsay. In order for a hearsay statement to be admissible under the party opponent exception, the statement must be one of the party opponent's own statements at a hearing, deposition, or other proceeding. The woman's statement to the police officer was not made at a hearing, deposition, or other proceeding. Therefore, it would not be admissible under the party opponent exception."

Because there is no hearsay exception that would make the woman\u2019s statement admissible to prove its truth, it would be inadmissible even if the prosecutor were to properly establish her unavailability. Answer C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement was made to a police officer following her arrest and not during a drug conspiracy with the defendant. The statement also certainly did nothing to further a drug conspiracy, even if one did exist. Answer D is incorrect.

The authentication or identification of an item may be made by anyone, including a witness with knowledge of the item's origin and ownership. Here, the law enforcement officer should be allowed to authenticate the items by testifying as to his knowledge that the items came from the apartment in which the defendant was an overnight guest. The standard for authentication is a preponderance of the evidence, which means that the trier of fact must be persuaded that the item is what the proponent has claimed it to be by a weight of the evidence that is slightly greater than 50%. A is incorrect because the clear and convincing evidence standard is not the correct standard for authentication. The clear and convincing evidence standard is used for matters that are exceptionally important to the party who will be bound by the determination. A preponderance of the evidence is always the correct standard for authentication. B is incorrect because the chain of custody is only relevant and important if there is some question as to whether the item has been altered in any way since it was taken from the apartment. If there is no question as to whether the item has been altered, then it is not relevant to the authentication of the item. Here, there is no indication that the items have been altered in any way, so the chain of custody is not relevant.

To be admissible for impeachment purposes only, the prior consistent statement must refer to the very matter in question i.e., \"I did see [the plaintiff] fall.\" Here, the prior consistent statement and the statement that was made to the investigator are statements about what the witness did or did not see. They both refer to the matter in question, whether the plaintiff fell, and they are consistent with one another.

It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect.

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth.

Instead, it is being offered to show that the plaintiff did in fact file for bankruptcy. Therefore, it is not offered for its truth, and it satisfies Federal Rule 803(6) regarding a record of regularly conducted business activity. A is incorrect. The newspaper story does not need to be authenticated because it is self-authenticating under Federal Rule 901(b). In addition, the story does not need to be authenticated because it satisfies Federal Rule 803(6) regarding a record of regularly conducted business activity. B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth. Instead, it is being offered to show that the plaintiff did in fact file for bankruptcy. Therefore, it does not satisfy Federal Rule 801(c) regarding hearsay. In addition, the story satisfies Federal Rule 803(6) regarding a record of regularly conducted business activity. C is incorrect.

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect. Because the newspaper story is not offered for its truth, but rather to demonstrate notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy, it is not hearsay, and no hearsay exception is required for its admission.

Four years later, the friend opened a tavern that sold alcoholic beverages on the property. Six months after the opening, while the friend continued to operate the tavern, the municipality in which the property is located validly condemned the property. There are no applicable statutes. To whom should the condemnation proceeds be paid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. To the friend and the grantor in equal shares, because they both had an interest in the property.\nB.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The estate the friend held was a fee simple determinable. This is because the grantor retained the power to terminate the estate by making a determination that alcoholic beverages be sold on the property. The friend\u2019s estate was terminated six months after he began selling alcoholic beverages. Thereafter, the grantor held a vested remainder, which is an interest that is fixed and free of any conditions. As such, when the municipality condemned the property, the grantor\u2019s vested remainder was taken, and he is entitled to the condemnation proceeds. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect because the friend\u2019s estate had ended six months prior to the condemnation. The friend no longer had an interest in the property at the time it was condemned. B is incorrect for the same reasons. In addition, the friend\u2019s continued possession after the sale of alcoholic beverages would not have prevented the termination of his estate. Once the grantor determined that the friend had sold alcoholic beverages on the property, the friend\u2019s estate ended immediately. C is incorrect. The limitation placed on the use of the property does not invalidate the interest. It merely defines the scope of the friend\u2019s estate."

She kept one lot for herself, conveyed another to her daughter, and conveyed the remaining lot to her son. Each conveyance was by a deed of gift containing a covenant specifying that only one single-story home could be constructed on the conveyed lot in order to preserve views of a nearby lake from the mother\u2019s lot. The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot. Several years later, the son conveyed his vacant lot to a purchaser using a warranty deed that made no mention of the covenant in the previous deed from the mother. The purchaser promptly recorded her deed. When the purchaser later began constructing a three-story house similar to the mother\u2019s, the mother sued to enjoin the construction. Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, since she herself constructed a three-story house.\nB. No, because there was no consideration given for the covenants in the deeds of gift.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The restriction described in the facts is an equitable servitude. An equitable servitude in a deed runs with the land under three exceptions: 1) where the servitude touches and concerns the land, 2) where the parties intended the servitude to run with the land, and 3) where the servitude is mentioned in the deed. In this case, the second exception is met because the deed expressly states that the restriction will run with the land. Also important is the fact that the servitude was mentioned in the deed, thereby meeting the third exception. The touches and concerns test is met because the restriction directly affects the use of the land. Therefore, the equitable servitude will run with the land, and because the purchaser\u2019s interest touches and concerns the land, the servitude will run with the land to the purchaser. A is incorrect because estoppel does not apply to these facts. There is no representation made that induced action by the purchaser. B is incorrect because, while the covenants in the deeds of gift did not mention consideration, it is well established that consideration is not required for the creation of a covenant. D is incorrect because there is no privity of contract between the mother and the purchaser. Only the mother and her son, and the mother and her daughter are in privity with each other, as they were parties to the contracts for deed."

The burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house), and the benefit was on her retained lot (to preserve her view of the lake). The equitable servitude was in writing and was recorded, providing constructive notice of it; actual notice was not required. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house) and the benefit was on the mother\u2019s retained lot, the benefit does not limit the mother to building only a one-story house. The mother was permitted to build a three-story house on her lot without being estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser of the son\u2019s lot. Answer B is incorrect.

Although some jurisdictions approve a deed in lieu of foreclosure as a substitute for foreclosure, any agreement to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure must be made prior to the commencement of the foreclosure proceeding. Therefore, the woman\u2019s proposal, even if acceptable to the bank, would not be a viable substitute for foreclosure in this case. B is incorrect. The rule that requires a foreclosure sale is limited to purchase money mortgages (i.e., mortgages given to purchase the property). As stated in the facts, the woman\u2019s mortgage was not a purchase money mortgage because she had been in possession of the property for five years before she defaulted on the mortgage payments. Therefore, the foreclosure sale is not required and the woman\u2019s deed in lieu of foreclosure is not valid. C is incorrect. Even though the bank would receive unencumbered title to the house from the woman, the woman\u2019s proposal, even if acceptable to the bank, would not be a viable substitute for foreclosure in this case. As stated above, any agreement to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure must be made prior to the commencement of the foreclosure proceeding. Therefore, it is irrelevant that the bank would receive unencumbered title to the house if it accepts the woman\u2019s proposal. D is incorrect. A short sale is a sale of property for less than is owed on the mortgage. In a short sale, the lender must approve the sale and must approve the use of the proceeds. In this case, there is no evidence that the bank would approve the use of the proceeds from the woman\u2019s proposed deed in lieu of foreclosure. In addition, any agreement to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure must be made prior to the commencement of the foreclosure proceeding. Therefore, the woman\u2019s proposal, even if acceptable to the bank, would not be a viable substitute for foreclosure in this case."

The contract provided that the closing would occur at the office of the seller\u2019s attorney 30 days after the date of the contract. Twenty days later, the buyer asked the seller if the closing could be postponed for 15 days beyond the scheduled closing date. The seller authorized her attorney to email the buyer saying that the closing date would be extended for 15 days but that \u201ctime is now of the essence.\u201d The buyer emailed back that the change was reasonable and thanked them. On the rescheduled closing date, the buyer was in a car accident on the way to the closing and was hospitalized for a month. When the buyer was released from the hospital, he told the seller and her attorney that he was now ready to close. They responded that the buyer had breached the contract and that there would be no closing. Can the buyer still enforce the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it was the buyer who had requested the change in the closing date.\nB. No, because time was made \u201cof the essence\u201d as to the rescheduled closing date.\nC. Yes, because the buyer\u2019s failure to appear at the rescheduled closing was justified.\nD.

            "explanation": "C is correct. A failure to perform is not a material breach unless time is made \"of the essence\" in the contract. In this case, the contract was amended to extend the closing date and the amendment stated time was of the essence. However, the reason the buyer did not appear at the rescheduled closing date was beyond his control--he was injured in a car accident. Therefore, his failure to appear at the closing was justified. A and B are incorrect. Time may be made \"of the essence\" in a contract to establish a specific time for performance, and if that time is not met, a material breach occurs. However, if the reason the buyer did not meet the deadline was beyond his control, his failure to appear at the closing would not be a breach. In this case, the reason the buyer did not appear at the rescheduled closing date was beyond his control--he was injured in a car accident. Therefore, his failure to appear at the closing was justified. D is incorrect. Making time \"of the essence\" in a contract establishes that a specific time for performance is critical to the contract, and if that time is not met, a material breach occurs. Even if a contract is silent on the issue, a party can amend the contract and make time \"of the essence\" in the amendment. In this case, the contract was amended to extend the closing date and the amendment stated time was of the essence. The buyer's failure to appear at the rescheduled closing date was a breach of that amendment."

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The initial contract did not require time to be \u201cof the essence\u201d for the closing. When the buyer requested a postponement of 15 days, the seller agreed but noted that time was now \u201cof the essence,\u201d which the buyer agreed was reasonable. Time may be made of the essence later if there is a reasonable time between the notice and the new date. Answer A is incorrect. A buyer can request a change in the closing date. If the seller had not agreed, the buyer could close within a reasonable time of the initial closing date because time had not yet been made of the essence. Answer C is incorrect. Time had been made \u201cof the essence\u201d when the closing date was changed. It is irrelevant why the buyer did not appear at the rescheduled closing. Answer D is incorrect. Though the original contract did not mention time being \u201cof the essence,\u201d time can be made \u201cof the essence\u201d in a later document provided that there is a reasonable time between the date of the notice that time is now \u201cof the essence\u201d and the rescheduled closing date.",

Seventeen years ago, the city discontinued using the land as a park. Because the city needed additional parking for nearby city buildings, it paved the land and has used it as a parking lot ever since. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Last year, the woman died intestate, leaving a son as her only heir. The son sued the city, claiming ownership of the land, but the court found against him. What is the most likely explanation for the court\u2019s decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The city acquired the land by adverse possession.\nB. The son\u2019s interest ended as a result of the changing needs of the city.\nC. The son\u2019s interest lapsed on the death of the woman.\nD.

To establish adverse possession, a party must show: 1) actual physical possession or occupancy of the land, 2) possession must be open and notorious, 3) possession must be actual and not merely constructive, 4) possession must be exclusive, and 5) possession must be for the required period of time under the statute of limitations. In this case, the city established all of the required elements to establish title in itself by adverse possession. The city\u2019s use of the land as a parking lot for 17 years was open and notorious, it was exclusive because it did not share control with anyone else, it was actual, and it lasted for the correct period of time under the statute of limitations.

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

The man signed a promissory note, which was secured by a mortgage on the building. Because the man had few other unencumbered assets, the bank required additional security. The man\u2019s mother granted the bank a mortgage on a motel that she owned, but she did not sign a promissory note. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. Five years later, after real estate values had dropped considerably, the man defaulted on the loan from the bank.

The mother timely objected to the foreclosure proceedings against the motel. The bank responded that it had the right to include both the commercial building and the motel in the foreclosure proceedings. Who is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The buyer promptly sued the man to establish her right to use the easement. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The buyer, because the easement was appurtenant to her land.\nB.

An appurtenant easement will run with the land, meaning when the woman conveyed her land to the buyer, the easement also conveyed to the buyer. If the man attempts to block the easement, the buyer can bring an action for injunction to prevent interference with the easement. B is incorrect. The man's receipt of $10,000 has no relation to whether the easement is appurtenant or profit.

An easement appurtenant can only be held by two parties - the owner of the dominant estate and the owner of the servient estate. While it is true that the woman held the easement as an appurtenant when she owned the land, her conveyance of the land to the buyer included the entire easement including the servient estate aspect which now rests with the buyer.

An easement appurtenant may be granted by purchase or by gift. Answer C is incorrect. The buyer did purchase the land without any type of notice, but this is not a reason for the man to prevail. The easement is for the benefit of whoever owns the land. The buyer can still assert her right to the easement appurtenant because the easement has not terminated.   Answer D is incorrect.

The nephew soon discovered that the land was subject to a mortgage held by a local bank, which required monthly payments for the next 10 years. Without telling the niece or seeking her permission, the nephew paid the monthly mortgage payments for one year. The nephew then demanded immediate payment from the niece for half of the mortgage payments he had made. The niece refused. If the nephew sues the niece for contribution, who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of exoneration.\nB. The nephew, because without his payments, the bank could have foreclosed the mortgage and they could have lost the land.\nC.

However, the paying tenant may not sue for reformation of the title to reflect the mortgage payments if the other tenant did not consent to the payments. So, if the nephew had sought the help of the court in demanding contribution from the niece, he may have been able to obtain reformation of title. But because he did not do so, he was not entitled to sue for contribution unless the niece knew of the payments and refused to contribute. Therefore, answer D is correct. Answer A is incorrect because the doctrine of exoneration applies where one tenant in common makes excessive or unwarranted payments on a mortgage, and the other tenants in common refuse to contribute to the mortgage payments. The paying tenant may then sue the other tenants in common for exoneration, seeking to eliminate their interest in the property. The nephew did not make excessive payments, so the doctrine of exoneration does not apply. Answer B is incorrect because the nephew has no claim against the bank.

The nephew paid more than his pro rata share and thus may recover the amount owed by the niece in a contribution action. Answer A is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration applies when land that is subject to a mortgage is acquired at the time of death and an attempt is made by the specific legatee to claim that the mortgage must be paid from general estate assets, a scenario that does not exist here.

The supplier became convinced that the lookout was a police informant. He persuaded the dealer that they should kill the lookout to avoid problems. They purchased a gun and ammunition to commit the murder and planned to dispose of the lookout\u2019s body by pushing it off a cliff. The supplier arranged a meeting in a remote area of a state park. After the three men arrived, the supplier fired two shots at the lookout, who fell to the ground. Both the supplier and the dealer believed that the lookout was dead. The dealer subsequently pushed the lookout\u2019s body off a nearby cliff. Unbeknownst to the supplier and the dealer, the lookout had been wounded by the bullets but was not dead; he died as a result of the fall from the cliff. Can the supplier be convicted of murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the shooting and the disposal of the body were separate events that cannot be viewed as a single scheme or plan.\nB. No, because the supplier did not intend that the fall from the cliff would kill the lookout.\nC. Yes, because both the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of the original plan to kill the lookout.\nD.

            "chosen_option_label": "B",
            "explanation": "B is correct. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought does not require specific intent, but it does require that the defendant acted with a reckless indifference to human life. In this case, the supplier is not guilty of murder because he did not intend for the lookout to die from the fall, and he did not act with reckless indifference to human life. Although he intended to kill the lookout by shooting him, the supplier did not have the intent that the lookout die from the fall, and he did not act with reckless indifference to human life when he caused the lookout's death. The supplier's conviction would properly be for attempted murder. A is incorrect. Any number of actions can be part of a single scheme or plan to commit a crime, as long as they are intended to and in fact do further the execution of the plan. In this case, the supplier, the dealer, and the lookout were all part of a single scheme to commit murder. The shooting, the pushing the body off a cliff, and the purchase of the gun and the plan to kill the lookout were all part of a single scheme to commit murder. Therefore, the supplier can be convicted of murder. C is incorrect. For conspiracy, there must be an agreement to commit a crime. In this case, the supplier and the dealer did not agree to murder the lookout's friend. They agreed to murder the lookout, but not his friend. Therefore, the supplier and the dealer cannot be convicted of murder based on conspiracy. However, the supplier can be convicted of murder because he acted with reckless indifference to human life when he shot the lookout and knew that his actions would cause great harm. D is incorrect. For murder, the defendant must have acted with malice aforethought, or he must have intended to kill or to cause serious bodily harm. Malice aforethought does not require the intent to kill or to cause serious bodily harm, but it does require the intent to commit a serious felony. In this case, the supplier shot the lookout because he believed the lookout was a police informant and was shooting at him. However, the supplier did not have the intent to kill or to cause serious bodily harm to the lookout's friend. He did not have the intent to commit murder, and he did not act with reckless indifference to human life when he shot the lookout's friend. The supplier's conviction would properly be for attempted murder. Although he intended to kill the lookout, he did not have the intent that the lookout die from the fall, and he did not act with reckless indifference to human life when he caused the lookout's death."

The agents told the woman that they would steal the drugs from a pharmacy. The next day, the agents met the woman and told her that they had the tablets in a bag. The bag did in fact contain tablets of the drug, but the agents had not stolen the tablets. The woman paid the agents. She told them that she did not want to take possession of the bag and that instead they should deliver it to her friend waiting in a car across the street. The agents, after delivering the bag to the woman\u2019s friend, arrested both the woman and her friend. Can the woman properly be convicted of attempting to receive stolen property?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the agents entrapped the woman.\nB. No, because the drugs were not stolen property.\nC.

She also received the property, which was the stolen prescription drugs, from the agents. The fact that the agents, and not someone else, stole the drugs does not change the fact that the woman received stolen property. Thus, answer B is incorrect. An attempt to commit a crime requires that the defendant take substantial steps toward the commission of the crime. Here, the woman agreed to buy the drugs, paid for them, and arranged to receive them. These actions constitute substantial steps toward the commission of the crime of receiving stolen property. Thus, answer C is incorrect. An agreement, coupled with an intent to commit the crime, constitutes attempted commission of the crime. Here, the woman agreed to buy and receive stolen property, and she intended to commit the crime. Thus, the woman can properly be convicted of attempting to receive stolen property. Answer A is incorrect because there is no evidence of entrapment here. The woman was repeatedly advised that the drugs were stolen, and she never wavered in her intent to buy and receive them."

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement. Under the applicable statute, the degree of the crime (and, hence, the severity of the authorized punishment) depends upon the value of the property embezzled.

A is incorrect because the woman did not embezzle $200,000; she only converted the original $100,000 to her own use.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The woman, by drinking to excess, took a calculated risk that created such a high probability of death that her conduct would amount to acting with a depraved heart. Since the woman's conduct was extreme enough to support a depraved-heart homicide instruction, such would also be the least serious homicide offense for which the woman could properly be convicted, and thus is the proper requested instruction. B is incorrect. An instruction on involuntary manslaughter would be improper in this case. An instruction on involuntary manslaughter would be proper only if the woman had been driving while intoxicated, but not to the extent of being intoxicated beyond the legal limit, and had thereby recklessly caused the death of another. However, in this case, the evidence shows that the woman was driving while intoxicated beyond the legal limit, and thus, the instruction on involuntary manslaughter would be improper. C is incorrect. An instruction on manslaughter, either voluntary or involuntary, would be improper in this case. The woman, by drinking to excess, took a calculated risk that created such a high probability of death that her conduct would amount to acting with a depraved heart. In addition, the woman's intoxication was voluntary, and thus, would not be a proper basis for an instruction on involuntary manslaughter.

On the facts described, a jury could potentially conclude that the woman did not act with the sort of aggravated recklessness necessary to constitute depraved-heart homicide or extreme-indifference murder, even though she was intoxicated and driving in an unlawful manner. Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

In this case, simple theft is a lesser included offense of aggravated theft. Therefore, the trial court must give an instruction on simple theft, regardless of whether the defense initially charged the defendant with the offense. B is incorrect. The value of the stolen computer equipment is an offense element, not a sentencing factor. B is an incorrect statement of the law and thus B is incorrect. C is incorrect. While it is true that a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses, a court need only instruct on those that are supported by the evidence in the case. In this case, the evidence supports an instruction on simple theft, so the trial court must give such an instruction. However, C misstates the required standard for giving instructions regarding lesser included offenses. The correct standard is given in D. D is correct. The trial court must give an instruction on a lesser included offense when the evidence in the case would allow a jury to rationally find the defendant not guilty of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser included offense. In this case, the jury, by its very nature, must determine the value of the computer equipment. If the jury finds the computer equipment to be worth less than $1,000, then a jury could rationally find the defendant not guilty of the greater offense of aggravated theft but guilty of the lesser included offense of simple theft.

The man did nothing but offer to pay, and this conduct is not \u201cdangerously proximate\u201d to the commission of the offense as required by the common law. Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony. Additionally, the facts do not establish a misprision. That offense   occurs when a person fails to inform the authorities about a felony that the person knows about.",

Through a window, the officers saw a man, whose hands were bleeding, shouting and throwing things, but no one else appeared to be present in the home. When the officers knocked on the door, the man refused to respond. The officers then asked if he needed medical assistance. The man told them to leave and not come back unless they had a warrant. The officers then entered the home, and the man pointed a shotgun at them. The officers withdrew but later arrested the man for felony assault on a police officer.

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC.

The standard of care for defense counsel in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial is to investigate the defendant's background and present mitigating evidence in an effort to render the client less culpable than he would seem to be after the guilt phase of the trial. Failure to do so, as in this case, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Thus, A and B are incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
