The court only considers the state where the company is incorporated and the state where the company is incorporated for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Where the company distributes its cars is not a relevant consideration. B is incorrect. This is the standard for determining minimum contacts, which is relevant to the court\u2019s analysis of personal jurisdiction, not diversity jurisdiction. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the court only considers the state of incorporation and principal place of business. C is correct. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, when a shareholder sues a corporation, the court only considers two factors: the state where the corporation is incorporated and the state where the corporation is headquartered. The shareholder\u2019s attorney would not need any more information to determine whether the parties are diverse. D is incorrect. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, when a shareholder sues a corporation, the court only considers two factors: the state where the corporation is incorporated and the state where the corporation is headquartered.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

The amended complaint asserted the $120,000 state-law claim and a related federal-law claim against both defendants. Twenty-five days after service of the amended complaint, the second defendant removed the action to a federal court in State B with the first defendant\u2019s consent. Was removal proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the first defendant was a citizen of the forum state.\nB. No, because the notice of removal was untimely.\nC.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The first defendant was not a citizen of the forum state for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. State B is the forum state, and the first defendant was a citizen of State B. Therefore, he was not a required party to the suit for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. A defendant who is a citizen of the forum state may consent to (and is not required to join in) a notice of removal. B is incorrect. The second defendant, against whom the related federal claim was asserted, was not added to the action for 70 days or more after it was filed. Therefore, the 30-day deadline for removal did not apply to the second defendant\u2019s notice of removal. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(d)(2), when an original complaint does not assert a federal claim but an amended complaint adds a federal claim, the 30-day removal deadline starts to run from the date when the last required joining defendant is joined. This is what occurred here: the first defendant was not a required joining defendant, but the second defendant was. The second defendant was added 25 days prior to the notice of removal, which was less than 70 days after his addition to the action. Therefore, the 30-day deadline for removal applied and the notice of removal was untimely. C is incorrect. The amended complaint asserted a claim under federal law; however, the second defendant who provided the notice of removal was not a party to the action for 25 days after the amended complaint was filed. Therefore, the 30-day deadline for removal applied and the notice of removal was untimely. For purposes of removal, a defendant must be a party to the action at the time of the removal. D is incorrect. For diversity jurisdiction, the parties must be diverse, i.e., from different states, and the amount at stake must be greater than $75,000. Here, the states of citizenship for the parties were diverse (State A and State B and State C), and the amount at stake was greater than $75,000. However, the first defendant was a citizen of the forum state, State B. Therefore, he was not a required party to the suit for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, and the diversity between the second defendant and the other two parties only did not satisfy the requirements for diversity jurisdiction because the first defendant was not diverse from the last defendant."

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

The defendant travels to State A once each year for a weeklong vacation but has no other State A contacts. The defendant answered, denying all allegations.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. A defendant does not waive the challenge to personal jurisdiction by failing to include it in her original answer; instead, the defendant must raise the challenge in the answer. Here, the defendant did raise the challenge to personal jurisdiction in a timely filed amended answer. B is incorrect. The 100-mile requirement only applies when service is made under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2)(B) -- here, service was made under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d) and (e). There are no similar restrictions on personal service, such as was used here, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1). C is incorrect. The court must consider the following factors to determine whether the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state: (1) the nature and quality of the interactions between the defendant and the forum state, (2) the manner in which the defendant interacted with the forum state (e.g. voluntarily, involuntarily), and (3 the expectation of being haled into court in the forum state. Here, the defendant has no interactions with State A, and so clearly has not established minimum contacts with State A. However, minimum contacts alone does not provide a defense to a personal jurisdiction challenge; the defendant must also show that the court's exercise of personal jurisdiction would be unconstitutional. Here, the court's exercise of personal jurisdiction would be unconstitutional because the defendant has no minimum contacts with State A and the state does not have a long arm statute that would allow the court to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. D is incorrect. There is no federal rule or state law that requires personal service on the defendant at his home before the court can exercise personal jurisdiction. Here, personal service was made at the defendant's office and was 50 miles from the federal courthouse -- this is not a violation of due process."

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h) permits litigants to raise personal-jurisdiction challenges for the first time in an answer that is amended as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1). Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants. Answer D is incorrect. Personal service under Rule 4 can occur at any location, not just the person\u2019s home.

In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis.

Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal.

In describing the events that led to the false accusations, the complaint quoted a statement of a competitor made to the employer about the worker\u2019s alleged theft.

The competitor opposed the motion on the ground that the statutory limitations period had expired. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery has closed, and the competitor will be prejudiced.\nB. No, because the amendment would not relate back and thus would be futile.\nC.

The complaint also included a quote from the competitor\u2019s statement to the employer that helped support the worker\u2019s accusation that the employer falsely accused the worker of stealing trade secrets from the employer. These allegations against the competitor arose out of the same factual circumstances as the original complaint, and therefore do relate back to the original complaint. A is incorrect. While it is true that the worker waited until after discovery had closed to make her motion to amend, this, in and of itself, is not a valid reason to deny the motion. The court should consider several factors including, but not limited to, whether the amendment would be prejudicial to the competitor, whether the competitor has already answered, and whether the amendment is made in bad faith. B is incorrect. As stated above, the proposed amendment to add the competitor as a defendant does relate back to the original complaint. Therefore, the amendment is not futile, and C is a better answer than B in this case. C is incorrect. The general rule is that a plaintiff must file an action for defamation within the applicable statute of limitations. The relation back doctrine is an exception to this rule. Therefore, it is not automatic that leave to amend should be freely granted when the underlying action was timely filed."

Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party.

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

As such, the friend had a duty to take steps to protect himself from the harm. His failure to do so amounts to an assumption of risk, and he will be barred from recovery. A is incorrect because the court should not enter a judgment as a matter of law for the friend; the friend\u2019s action amounts to an assumption of risk, which will bar his recovery.

In Klaxon, the US Supreme Court ruled that in cases governed by Erie, the court is to apply whatever law would be applied by the courts of the state in which the district court is sitting, not simply forum law. Answer C is incorrect. Under Erie, the fact that the action is in federal court does not create a right to apply federal law, and state substantive law governs. Answer D is incorrect. While the constitutional limit preempts any state law that would extend that limit, the state-law limit here is less than the constitutional limit and thus controls.",

The complaint alleged that the fire had been caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the house\u2019s electrical system in accordance with the applicable housing code. The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent. In opposition to that motion, the tenant argues that under federal law, contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defendant who wishes to assert the defense must plead in an answer or other responsive pleading. Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB. Federal law, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control pleading in federal court.\nC. State law, because the application of federal law would be outcome-determinative.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. Whether the burden of pleading is substantive or procedural does not determine whether federal or state law governs. Rather, the court must follow the federal common resolution of the issue, which is that the burden of pleading is substantive. However, in this case, there is no federal common resolution of the issue; the federal courts follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which place the burden of pleading on the motion to dismiss. B is correct. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control the standard for a pleading in federal court. The motion to dismiss can only be granted if the tenant failed to include an required allegation in his complaint and that omission is fatal to the tenant\u2019s claim. Therefore, the court should deny the motion to dismiss because the tenant\u2019s complaint includes all required allegations. C is incorrect. The question is not whether federal law or state law governs the standard for a pleading in federal diversity action. Rather, the question is what standard for a pleading the court should apply. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control the standard for a pleading in federal court and would require the court to deny the motion to dismiss. D is incorrect.

Rule 8(c)(1) is on point because it specifically provides that contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defending party must assert in its answer to the complaint. The rule is a valid exercise of the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power, because the manner of pleading defenses is an issue that can rationally be classified as procedure and the rule itself regulates the manner and means by which the parties\u2019 rights are enforced. Answer A is incorrect. The question of who has the burden of pleading, in contrast to the burden of proof, in federal actions is a procedural matter within the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power. Answer C is incorrect. The \u201coutcome determinative\u201d test applies only when asking whether a state rule that conflicts with a judge-made federal practice should be followed.

The parties do not need to be diverse to have a counterclaim, although diversity would be a possible basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction. Here, the broker could join his contract claim as a counterclaim under Federal Rule 13 because his claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor's claim. In this case, the broker's alleged misrepresentions regard the investments he made on the investor's behalf, and the investor's failure to pay for those investments is a claim that arises out of that same transaction. C is incorrect. Even though the broker's breach of contract claim would be a compulsory counterclaim if it had been brought as an independent action, Federal Rule 13 requires that a counterclaim be compulsory only if the original claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the suit. Here, as stated above, the broker's misrepresentations and the investor's failure to pay all arise out of the same transaction or occurrence. D is incorrect. Even though the broker's breach of contract claim would be a permissive counterclaim if it had been brought as an independent action, Federal Rule 13 allows permissive counterclaims only if they are not compulsory. Here, as stated above, the broker's misrepresentations and the investor's failure to pay all arise out of the same transaction or occurrence. Therefore, the broker's breach of contract claim must be a compulsory counterclaim. The only reason the broker cannot do so here is that the investor is not a proper defendant for the broker's breach of contract claim. It is unclear from the facts whether there is complete diversity between the parties for the broker's breach of contract claim."

The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

Instead, the claim is a run-of-the-mill breach-of-contract action that treats the reporter exactly the same way the state would treat anyone else.

The statute authorizes the President to appoint the agency\u2019s director with the advice and consent of the Senate and prohibits the President from removing the director without the Senate\u2019s consent. The President appointed a director, and the Senate confirmed the appointment. Recently, the President has become dissatisfied with the director\u2019s strict approach to drug-law enforcement and wishes to remove the director. Because a majority of senators favor strict drug-law enforcement, the Senate has refused to consent to the director\u2019s removal. May the President constitutionally remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director\u2019s appointment and removal.\nB. No, because the President\u2019s removal of principal officers of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\nC. Yes, because congressional participation in the decision to remove a presidential appointee violates the separation of powers.\nD.

The President's discretion to execute the drug laws is constitutionally impaired because he necessarily will wish to remove directors who fail to conform to his drug-law-enforcement views.

Myers and subsequent cases make it clear that the Senate has no role in the removal of federal officers other than via impeachment. Answer D is incorrect because it is an overbroad statement of the law.

The agreement provided that the contractor must pay for all materials and expenses from a special bank account into which the government would deposit required payments and reimbursements. The state collected a generally applicable sales tax from the contractor on materials purchased for the work with money from the special bank account. Was the state\u2019s imposition of the sales tax constitutional in this situation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the federal government is immune from any taxes levied by a state.\nB. No, because the tax was paid from an account directly funded with federal money and the entire economic cost of the tax was borne by the federal government.\nC. Yes, because payment of the tax did not unduly interfere with the contractor\u2019s performance of the work and was not an undue burden on a federal function.\nD.

However, the supremacy clause does not prevent the state from collecting its generally applicable sales tax on the contractor's purchase of materials. The tax does not discriminate against the federal government, and the contractor, not the federal government, purchased the materials. A is incorrect because the federal government is not immune from all state taxes. The general rule is that the federal government is immune from state taxation, but there are several exceptions. One exception applies when a state tax is levied as a sales tax on the contractor's purchase of materials. Such a tax does not impose an undue burden on the federal function, and the tax does not discriminate against the federal government. B is incorrect because the federal government is not immune from state taxation on the contractor's activities. Also, if a state tax is not levied on the federal government directly, the tax is not unconstitutional if it is levied on a private entity that is not performing a traditional public function. Here, the contractor is performing a private function, and the tax is not levied on the contractor's performance. C is incorrect because the sale tax is constitutional as applied to the contractor, even though it may have some small impact on the contractor's performance.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC.

Here, the person deciding whether to continue the resident's water service is not a public official and there is no indication that the public official who granted the company the franchise exercises control over the company's decisions in this area. Therefore, the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the resident does not have a claim under that amendment. B is incorrect. This answer suggests that a person cannot seek injunctive relief in the absence of payment. That is not correct. Here, the company has not terminated water service from anyone and sought payment. Instead, it has simply terminated a customer's water service. There is no indication that the company will seek payment from the resident. Moreover, even if the company does seek payment, the resident may be able to enjoin the company from not providing him water on the grounds that the company's policy is unconstitutional. C and D are incorrect. The Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to private entities performing public functions, nor does it apply to private franchises granted by public entities.

The law is probably content based because it is designed to ensure \"the high quality of tutors.\" The organization's lobbying is also evidence that the law is content based, since it would not be worth lobbying to relax a rational basis standard of review. Moreover, the state does not have unlimited authority to decide who may engage in expression. In order to justify a content-based law, the state must satisfy strict scrutiny, which requires the state to prove that the law is necessary to serve a compelling government interest. The state cannot meet this burden here because the licensing law is not necessary to ensure high quality tutors, since other measures could ensure tutor quality, such as providing additional training to tutors who are not licensed. D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV prohibits a state from treating out-of-state residents worse than residents of the state. However, the clause does not apply to the state's treatment of its own residents, and therefore, it does not apply here.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

Moreover, sterilization is only required in circumstances where a person has been convicted of a sex offense for the second time, so it is likely that the measure would be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest. B is incorrect. A challenge under the equal protection clause must be grounded in a classification that discriminates against a particular group. Men, as a group, are not discriminated against by the requirement of sterilization. Rather, the argument should be grounded in the fact that all persons subjected to the requirement of sterilization are male. However, since sex is not a suspect class, and the law does not classify on the basis of gender in a way that discriminates against men, the classification would only have to be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. C is incorrect. A challenge under the equal protection clause must be grounded in a classification that discriminates against a particular group. The statistics show that members of racial minority groups are overrepresented in the population of convicted sex offenders, but the law does not classify on the basis of race. Rather, the argument should be grounded in the disparate impact of the law on members of racial minority groups. However, since the law does not classify on the basis of race, the argument would have to be that the law has a disparate impact on members of racial minority groups. D is incorrect.

Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect. It states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not applicable in this case. The state sterilization requirement would receive strict judicial scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation.",

A tax that is imposed on everything within a certain class is generally constitutional unless it is shown to be irrational. B is incorrect because the state may impose indirect taxes on the federal government. These types of taxes are constitutional as long as they are generally applied and not discriminatory against the federal government. Therefore, the tax in this case can be imposed on the lease of office space and is an indirect tax because it is calculated on gross rent and is imposed on the lessee. C is incorrect because the analysis does not change regardless of whether the federal agency is independent or part of one of the branches of government. An independent agency is still part of the federal government and can be indirectly taxed in the same manner as other parts of the government. A is incorrect because, although the tax may be subject to rational basis review, it is constitutional because it is generally applied and does not discriminate against the federal government."

B is incorrect. Although the contract was created with the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment form, under UCC 2-207(2), additional terms will not serve as a condition to a contract\u2019s formation. In this case, the contract was formed when the manufacturer shipped the laptops, and its subsequent acknowledgment form, which excluded consequential damages, will be construed according to UCC 2-207(2). C is incorrect. Under UCC 2-206(1)(b), acceptance of a contract shall operate as such even if the seller's notice of acceptance is conditional on the buyer's conduct.

Here, the shipment of the laptops constituted the manufacturer\u2019s acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer and the terms set forth in the offer. Answer A is incorrect. The manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops was a reasonable mode of acceptance and gave rise to a contract. Answer B is incorrect. The retailer\u2019s order constituted an offer, and a contract was formed when the manufacturer shipped the laptops. Therefore, the exclusion of consequential damages in the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment constituted a request to modify that contract. The exclusion would become a term of the parties\u2019 agreement if the retailer assented to it, which did not occur here.   Answer D is incorrect.

The wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract is mistake, which is available if the parties entered into the contract based on a mistake of fact that defeats the purpose of the contract or renders one of the agreements impossible to perform. When the wife learned a few days after the sale that she did not need to sell the farm and that her husband had left her a substantial life insurance policy, she discovered a mistake of fact, known as a mistake negating the purpose of the contract, and thereby provided a basis for rescission of the contract. A is incorrect because there was no threat or coercion that forced the wife to agree to the sale of the farm. In order to establish a valid duress claim, a party must show that they entered into a contract as a result of serious and unfair pressure or threat that deprived the party of an exercise of free will. Here, there was no threat or coercion involved; rather the wife was misled by the statements of the brother and his attorney into signing the offer to purchase. C is incorrect because the contract is unenforceable on grounds of unconscionability Abusus consensui non tollit conventionem. The contract must have been both unconscionable at the time that the parties entered into it and remain unconscionable at the time of enforcement. D is incorrect because the contract is enforceable and there are no elements of undue influence present. A party will be found to have undue influence if the party taking advantage of the other's confidence has taken advantage of a confidence reposed in him in a legal transaction; the person confiding has a disability; and the person taking advantage of the confidence has taken unfair advantage of the disability."

The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber.

The appraiser told the heir that he had no expertise in appraising art and recommended that she hire an art appraiser to value the painting. The heir, doubting that the painting was valuable, declined to follow the appraiser\u2019s advice and decided to sell the painting at a yard sale. She set the price at $100, assuming that this price reflected the painting\u2019s approximate value. A neighbor, who knew nothing about art, purchased the painting from the heir at the asking price. The neighbor and the heir later discovered that the painting was worth over $900,000. Would the heir be likely to prevail in an action to rescind the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the heir bore the risk of any mistake as to the true value of the painting.\nB. No, because the neighbor possessed no specialized knowledge of the true value of the painting.\nC.

The firm is entitled to recover nominal damages only, because it completed the construction at a profit.\nB. The firm is entitled to recover reliance damages, because it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid when it submitted its own bid to the municipality.\nC.

If a bid is to be irrevocable, the bid notice or contract provisions must clearly state that the bid is to be considered a firm commitment. If the bid notice or contract provisions do not so state, then the bid is not to be considered a firm commitment, and the bidder is free to revoke its bid at any time before the bid is accepted. In this case, there are no bid regulations or provisions that state the bid is to be considered a firm commitment. Therefore, the subcontractor was free to revoke its bid at any time before the bid was accepted, which did not occur in this case. A is incorrect because the firm has not submitted a valid claim for damages against the subcontractor. B is incorrect because the firm detrimentally relied on the subcontractor's promise to perform (i.e., to do the electrical work), not its bid. C is incorrect because even if the bid were considered accepted by the subcontractor when it withdrew its bid, it would not be bound to perform for more than a reasonable time, and there is no indication that a reasonable time had passed."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

In return for his daughter\u2019s promise to pay $300,000 to his nephew at the time of the father\u2019s death, the father executed and delivered to his daughter a quitclaim deed to the land. The daughter took possession of the land. Two years later, in a signed writing, the father directed his daughter to pay to a neighbor, at the father\u2019s death, $50,000 of the $300,000 that was to go to the nephew. The daughter, who had long disliked the neighbor, told her father that she did not plan to honor his request. The father died, and his daughter has since refused to pay anything to either the nephew or the neighbor. The neighbor has sued the daughter for the $50,000. Is the neighbor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter did not consent to any modification of the contract she had made with her father.\nB. No, because the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, and the nephew\u2019s interest could not be modified without his express written consent.\nC. Yes, because the father retained a transferable interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. A promise to surrender a right to payment under an existing contract operates as a discharge of the duty and is enforceable without consideration under the doctrine of novation. Once discharges, the modified promise is enforceable as a new contract. Under the common law, a parent cannot discharge an obligation of a child, or a child an obligation of a parent. However, many states have enacted legislation to override the common law and permit the discharge of parental obligations and the obligations of children to parents. Because the father-daughter agreement is enforceable and the daughter promised to pay $50,000 to the neighbor, the neighbor should prevail. A is incorrect. With respect to their respective rights and duties under a contract, parties whose relationships fall within one of the statutorily recognized categories of parties to a contract (such as parent and child) may discharge obligations with respect to each other by novation, which does not require consideration. Therefore, the father and daughter could modify their agreement even without the daughter's consent. B is incorrect. The nephew was intended beneficiary and not a promised beneficiary. In order to enforce rights as an intended beneficiary, the beneficiary must be capable of suing for breach and be entitled to receive the performance directly. Only the daughter can sue for breach of the father's promise to her. After the father's death, the nephew must sue the daughter, the promisor, for breach. He is not entitled to payment directly. C is incorrect. Even if the father had retained a transferable interest in the proceeds of his promise, he effectuated a discharge of his duty by the express terms of the modification, which was enforceable as a new contract."

Here, however, there was no modification of the contract, because the daughter did not agree to it. Answer C is incorrect. The father retained no interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise, and thus he could not alter her obligation without her consent. Answer D is incorrect. There was no effective modification, because the daughter did not agree to it.

A is the better answer because the company\u2019s lack of knowledge about the notice and the fact that the homeowner did not visit the website creates a lack of duty on the company\u2019s part.

The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

Those states apply a negligence standard, but require the child to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was in a position where he did not realize the risk involved in playing on the defendant's premises. More specifically, the child must prove that he was unaware of the danger, i.e., that he was a mere child unappreciative of danger, and that he was on the premises for a legitimate purpose, i.e., not a trespasser.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB. No, because the former employee could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts.\nC.

No, because after the buyer handed the keys to the employee, the car was no longer her property.\nC. Yes, because a possessor can use nonlethal force to protect his or her property.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The buyer, as the possessor of the car, was privileged to use non-lethal force to protect it, but the privilege is only available if the force used is reasonable. Therefore, if a fact-finder determines that the buyer used excessive force, the privilege will not be available and the buyer's motion for summary judgment should not be granted. B is incorrect. The buyer's property interest in the car did not terminate until the car was removed by the repossession company, and the buyer's motion for summary judgment is based on her claim that she was privileged to act as she did to protect her property. Therefore, whether or not the buyer had a property interest in the car is irrelevant to her claim of privilege to protect it from trespass. C is incorrect. While it is true that a possessor can use non-lethal force to protect his or her property, the force used must also be reasonable. Therefore, if a fact-finder determines that the buyer used excessive force, the privilege will not be available and the buyer's motion for summary judgment should not be granted. D is incorrect. The buyer's claim of privilege to protect her property is only available if the force she used was reasonable. Therefore, whether or not the buyer acted reasonably in asking to retrieve her laptop is irrelevant to her claim of privilege to protect it with force."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The buyer intentionally shoved the employee, which satisfies the prima facie case for battery. As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

            "explanation": "C is correct. Res ipsa loquitur applies when: (1) the patient suffers injury; (2) the injury is of a sort that would not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence on the part of the defendant; and (3) the defendant had control over the agency or instrumentality which caused the injury. The fact that the passenger\u2019s actions ended up causing his injury does not mean that res ipsa loquitur is inapplicable. The passenger\u2019s actions do not rise to the level of contributory negligence, and the defendant\u2019s negligence has not yet been determined. Thus A is incorrect. The court should grant the passenger\u2019s request for res ipsa loquitur instruction, and also give a modified res ipsa loquitur instruction that would allow the jury to consider whether the passenger's actions were a contribution to his injury. Thus C is correct. If the jury finds for the passenger, it will then consider whether his actions were a contribution to his injury and, if so, how they should allocate responsibility. Thus B is incorrect. A res ipsa loquitur instruction does not mean that the court or jury will automatically find the passenger responsible for his injury. The issue to be decided is whether an instruction on res ipsa loquitur is proper, not whether the passenger contributed to his own injury. Thus D is incorrect. The reasonableness of the passenger\u2019s actions is not the issue in this question. The issue to be decided is whether an instruction on res ipsa loquitur is proper."

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

Although some jurisdictions may recognize an exception for conditions that are harmful to the mental health of those affected, such an exception is not recognized in this jurisdiction. Thus, D is the best choice. A is incorrect. While damage to property may be considered in determining whether an interference with use or enjoyment of property is substantial, it is not the only factor to consider, nor is it a requirement. B is incorrect. While a physical intrusion onto another's land may support a claim of private nuisance, it is not required. C is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

Evidence of attempting to avoid detection to prevent arrest is relevant to show the defendant's consciousness of guilt and, if accepted as true by the jury, his guilt of the conspiracy charge. Here, the defendant's purchase of an airplane ticket using an alias while on bail with travel restricted to his home state is relevant evidence that his consciousness of guilt was sufficient to induce him to attempt to avoid detection by traveling out of the country under an alias. A is incorrect because the evidence of the defendant's purchase of an airplane ticket using an alias does make a fact of consequence to the trial (whether the defendant conspired to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute) more or likely than it would without the evidence. D is incorrect because the charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute already alleges the defendant's motive to commit the crime (to distribute cocaine and make a profit). Therefore, evidence of a separate motive is not relevant to any fact of consequence in this trial. In addition, checking for good faith would not be part of the analysis in this question because the evidence is being considered under Rule 404 of the Evidence Code, not Rule 411."

Answer B is incorrect. Evidence of an intent to flee is relevant to show the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt but not to show his motive to commit the crime. The defendant\u2019s attempt to flee the jurisdiction after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime. Answer D is incorrect. Proof of motive is generally relevant and admissible, but evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to flee after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime.

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value.

Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103.

B is incorrect because every witness in a jury trial has a personal interest in the outcome of the action. The personal interest in the outcome goes to the weight that the trier of fact should give the witness's testimony, not to whether the witness should be permitted to testify. When a witness's opinion meets the requirements of Rule 701, the opinion is admissible even if the witness is biased. D is incorrect because there is no rule that allows property owners to express an opinion on changes in the value of their property. If the property owner's opinion satisfies Rule 701, it is admissible. The stockholder's opinion, while he may be a property owner, satisfies Rule 701 and is admissible."

Under FRE 701, the stockholder\u2019s testimony is inadmissible.   Answer B is incorrect. If otherwise qualified, an expert witness can have a personal interest in the outcome of the action and still testify. The expert\u2019s personal interest can be explored on cross-examination. In this case, however, the stockholder is not qualified as an expert. Answer C is incorrect. An admissible opinion about the cause of the price drop cannot be based on the stockholder\u2019s perception; it requires an expertise that he does not possess. His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue. Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 701, property owners are entitled to express opinions on the value of their property, but here the stockholder is expressing an opinion on the cause of the publicly traded stock\u2019s price drop. Such testimony requires a witness with specialized knowledge about the stock market.",

On the night of the alleged sale, a police officer arrested a woman and found a large package of cocaine in her car. The woman was brought to the police station for questioning. During her interrogation, she admitted to a police officer that she had sold cocaine and said that she had obtained the cocaine from the defendant, who was a local supplier. By the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, the woman has left the country. The prosecutor calls the police officer to testify that the woman told him that the defendant was her cocaine supplier. The defendant\u2019s attorney objects. Is the woman\u2019s statement to the police officer admissible to prove that the defendant sold cocaine?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the prosecutor has not shown that the woman\u2019s attendance at trial could not have been procured through process or other reasonable means.\nC.

There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth.

Instead, it is being offered to show that the plaintiff's bankruptcy was newsworthy and thereby to establish that the defendant likely received notice of the bankruptcy."

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect. Because the newspaper story is not offered for its truth, but rather to demonstrate notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy, it is not hearsay, and no hearsay exception is required for its admission.

Four years later, the friend opened a tavern that sold alcoholic beverages on the property. Six months after the opening, while the friend continued to operate the tavern, the municipality in which the property is located validly condemned the property. There are no applicable statutes. To whom should the condemnation proceeds be paid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. To the friend and the grantor in equal shares, because they both had an interest in the property.\nB. To the friend, because he was in possession on the date of the condemnation.\nC. To the friend, because the limitation is an invalid restraint on the sale of alcohol.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The estate the friend received was a fee simple determinable. The friend's estate would automatically terminate if alcoholic beverages were sold on the property. Although the municipality's valid condemnation of the property would normally result in the grantor losing control over the property and the friend taking possession in fee simple, there is an exception if the property was taken in part to abrogate or satisfy a mortgage or other mortgage type easement or covenant. There is also an exception if the property was taken to abrogate or satisfy a mortgage type pledge of the property. However, if the property was taken to satisfy a condition to a warranty, the termination will be recognized, and the friend never took possession in fee simple. Therefore, when the property was condemned and the condition relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages was satisfied, the friend's estate terminated and the grantor is entitled to all of the condemnation proceeds. A is incorrect because the friend's estate terminated when the condition relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages was satisfied prior to the condemnation. Because the friend no longer held an interest in the property, the grantor is entitled to all of the condemnation proceeds. B is incorrect for the same reasons. C is incorrect because the grantor's restriction on the sale of alcoholic beverages is valid and enforceable. The friend's estate terminated when the condition relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages was satisfied, and the grantor is entitled to all of the condemnation proceeds."

She kept one lot for herself, conveyed another to her daughter, and conveyed the remaining lot to her son. Each conveyance was by a deed of gift containing a covenant specifying that only one single-story home could be constructed on the conveyed lot in order to preserve views of a nearby lake from the mother\u2019s lot. The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot. Several years later, the son conveyed his vacant lot to a purchaser using a warranty deed that made no mention of the covenant in the previous deed from the mother. The purchaser promptly recorded her deed. When the purchaser later began constructing a three-story house similar to the mother\u2019s, the mother sued to enjoin the construction. Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, since she herself constructed a three-story house.\nB. No, because there was no consideration given for the covenants in the deeds of gift.\nC.

However, it says nothing about the house that the mother is building on her lot. Therefore, the mother's three-story house does not violate the terms of the covenant, so A is incorrect. In addition, the four corollary elements of a covenant running with the land are: 1) the covenant must be touching and concerning the land; 2) the covenant must be noted in the deed or made in writing; 3) there must be privity of estate between the parties; and 4) the subsequent grantee must have had record notice of the covenant. Clearly, the covenant is touching and concerning the land, it is noted in the deed, and there is privity of estate in this case (mother and son are in privity, and son and purchaser are in privity). Therefore, C is correct. B is incorrect because the enforcement of covenant does not require consideration. D is incorrect because the mother and the purchaser are not in privity of contract.

The equitable servitude was in writing and was recorded, providing constructive notice of it; actual notice was not required. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house) and the benefit was on the mother\u2019s retained lot, the benefit does not limit the mother to building only a one-story house. The mother was permitted to build a three-story house on her lot without being estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser of the son\u2019s lot. Answer B is incorrect.

The listing agreement was not recorded. The list price for the house was $250,000.

Yes, because the broker produced a ready, willing, and able buyer during the term of the listing agreement, and the buyer\u2019s offer matched the ultimate sale price.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. In order to be entitled to a commission under a listing agreement, the broker must find a \"ready, willing, and able\" buyer. A ready, willing, and able buyer is one who is able to enter into a binding contract to purchase the property. In addition, the buyer must be one who is prepared to enter into a contract on the terms set by the seller, and one who is willing to enter into a contract without attempting to renegotiate the terms. Here, the broker found a ready, willing, and able buyer within the terms of the listing contract, but the woman rejected the offer. A broker is not entitled to a commission if the property is sold by the owner to a third party before the expiration of the listing contract, even if the owner employed the broker to sell the property. Thus B is correct. A is incorrect because the listing agreement does not have to be recorded in order for the broker to be entitled to a commission. Under an exclusive right to sell listing agreement, the broker is entitled to a commission upon the sale of the property, regardless of whether the broker was the one who produced the buyer. In addition, a listing agreement creates agency rights and interests, which need not be recorded in order to be valid. C is incorrect because the terms of the listing agreement did not promise a commission if the final sale price was the same as the offer the woman rejected. In addition, the buyer that the broker found was not the buyer that ultimately purchased the property. D is incorrect because the woman was under no obligation to disclose her reasons for rejecting the offer. The broker is entitled to the commission only if the woman effectuates a sale of the property to a buyer that the broker found."

            "explanation": "C is correct. This solution is voluntary on the part of both parties and will result in the bank receiving unencumbered title to the property. As such, it is a viable foreclosure alternative. A is incorrect because the doctrine of clogs on the equity of redemption is a restriction on voluntary post-foreclosure transfers by mortgagors. The mortgagor is free to encumber or transfer their equity of redemption voluntarily, without violating the doctrine. In addition, the mortgagor's right of redemption is only affected after the mortgage debt is accelerated. In this case, the mortgage is still paid on a priority basis, and there is no impairment of the mortgagee's right to payment from the property or the mortgagor's right to redeem the mortgage. B is incorrect because the rule requiring a foreclosure sale applies only to residential property in states that recognize the statutory right of redemption. This is commercial property, so there is no requirement of a foreclosure sale. In addition, even if it were residential, the mortgagor and mortgagee can agree to waive the right of redemption. D is incorrect because a short sale is a pre-foreclosure sale that occurs when the mortgagee agrees to accept less than the full amount of the mortgage debt in exchange for the mortgagor's deed to the property. In this fact pattern, the woman has already defaulted on her mortgage, so any sale of the property would have to occur as part of a foreclosure alternative."

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The fact that the buyer requested the postponement of the closing date does not determine whether time is \"of the essence\" in the contract. Making time \"of the essence\" in a contract means that strict compliance with a final deadline is required; any failure to meet that deadline results in the automatic termination of the duty to perform. In this case, the original contract provided a 30-day closing period, and time was not \"of the essence\" during that period. The parties then extended the closing deadline 15 days beyond the original deadline, but they expressly made time \"of the essence\" as to the rescheduled closing date. Therefore, the buyer had a duty to appear at the rescheduled closing date. Because the car accident and the buyer's resulting hospitalization were unforeseen and unforeseeable, the buyer's failure to appear at the rescheduled closing date was justified. His failure to appear should not be treated as a material breach of the contract, and the buyer remains entitled to enforce the contract. B is incorrect. When the parties made time \"of the essence\" as to the rescheduled closing date, they were, in effect, converting the contract into a fixed-time-deadline contract. But the fact that a contract has a fixed-time-deadline does not determine whether a party's failure to meet the deadline will be treated as a material breach. In this case, the buyer's failure to appear at the rescheduled closing date was justified, so his failure to meet the deadline should not be treated as a material breach of the contract, and the buyer remains entitled to enforce the contract.

Seventeen years ago, the city discontinued using the land as a park. Because the city needed additional parking for nearby city buildings, it paved the land and has used it as a parking lot ever since. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Last year, the woman died intestate, leaving a son as her only heir.

To obtain land through adverse possession, a party must for the length of the statutory period: 1) have actual physical possession or occupancy of the land, 2) maintain that possession continuously and without interruption, 3) exclude others from possession, 4) have \"hostile\" possession (be there without permission), and 5) maintain \"open and notorious\" possession. Here, the city had actual possession of the land, maintained that possession for the length of the statutory period, excluded others from possession, and was there without permission. The city's paving of the land and use of it as a parking lot for the last seventeen years was open and notorious use of the land. The son did not have an interest that would allow him to exclude the city from its hostile possession, so answer A is the most likely explanation for the court\u2019s decision. B is incorrect because the adverse possession described above is not dependent upon the needs of the city.

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The nephew will likely prevail in his suit for contribution against the niece. Although contribution between tenants in common is only available after one tenant in common has made excess payments (i.e. payments that exceed his share of the liability), here the mortgage payments are the type of obligation (a mortgage as to a portion of land) that runs with the land, making the niece liable for the payments even though the land is vacant and she received no benefit from the payments. Therefore, the nephew will not be required to seek permission from the court before requiring the niece to contribute to the payments, and he may bring an action directly against the niece. A is incorrect because the doctrine of exoneration only allows one tenant in common to seek payment from another tenant in common where the land has been improved (e.g. in an apartment building, where one tenant added a new elevator) and the improving tenant seeks payment from the other tenants for their share of the cost of the improvement. Here, the mortgage payments are the type of obligation (a mortgage as to a portion of land) that runs with the land, making the niece liable for her share of the payments even though the land is vacant and she received no benefit from the payments. C is incorrect because a partition proceeding is only necessary where two joint tenants or tenants by the entirety cannot agree on how to terminate their interest. Tenants in common, however, can always choose to partition the property, but are not required to do so before bringing a suit for contribution. D is incorrect because the nephew did not need the niece\\'s consent in order to make the mortgage payments. Although the niece and the nephew are tenants in common and the nephew could not unilaterally sell the niece\\'s interest without her permission, the niece had chosen to live in another state and had given the nephew sole responsibility for handling the mortgage payments. As such, the nephew was acting as the agent of the niece when he made the mortgage payments and did not need her consent in order to do so."

The nephew paid more than his pro rata share and thus may recover the amount owed by the niece in a contribution action. Answer A is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration applies when land that is subject to a mortgage is acquired at the time of death and an attempt is made by the specific legatee to claim that the mortgage must be paid from general estate assets, a scenario that does not exist here.

A partition action is not required before bringing an action for contribution for making mortgage payments that, if not made, might have resulted in the foreclosure on the property by the bank.

The supplier became convinced that the lookout was a police informant. He persuaded the dealer that they should kill the lookout to avoid problems. They purchased a gun and ammunition to commit the murder and planned to dispose of the lookout\u2019s body by pushing it off a cliff. The supplier arranged a meeting in a remote area of a state park. After the three men arrived, the supplier fired two shots at the lookout, who fell to the ground. Both the supplier and the dealer believed that the lookout was dead. The dealer subsequently pushed the lookout\u2019s body off a nearby cliff. Unbeknownst to the supplier and the dealer, the lookout had been wounded by the bullets but was not dead; he died as a result of the fall from the cliff. Can the supplier be convicted of murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the shooting and the disposal of the body were separate events that cannot be viewed as a single scheme or plan.\nB. No, because the supplier did not intend that the fall from the cliff would kill the lookout.\nC. Yes, because both the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of the original plan to kill the lookout.\nD.

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The supplier can be convicted of murder because the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of a single scheme or plan to kill the lookout. Although there was conduct in between, that conduct was all part of the overall plan to kill the lookout, and there would be no conviction for murder even if the lookout had not died from the fall, but had died from the two gunshot wounds. See People v. Doolin, 6 Cal.4th 451 (1993) (holding that, for conspiracy and conspiracy-related murder convictions, the conduct of the co-conspirators need not be found to have caused the victim's death, but rather it must be shown that the murder was the result of the plan in which the defendant was a participant). B is incorrect. The supplier's intent to kill the lookout, combined with his belief that he had already done so, is sufficient to prove that the supplier intended to cause the lookout's death. Because the supplier intended to kill the lookout and believed that he had done so, the supplier can be convicted of murder. In addition, the doctrine of transferred intent applies to the facts of this question. Transferred intent is the rule that the intent to commit a crime will attach to the actual result of the actor's conduct, even if that result was not the one the actor had contemplated. Therefore, the supplier's intent to kill the lookout, combined with his belief that he had already done so, is sufficient to prove that the supplier intended to cause the lookout's death. See, e.g., People v. Henderson, 16 Cal.4th 634 (1997) (applying transferred intent to conviction for murder). C is correct. The supplier can be convicted of murder because both the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of the overall plan to kill the lookout. See People v. Doolin, 6 Cal.4th 451 (1993) (holding that, for conspiracy and conspiracy-related murder convictions, the conduct of the co-conspirators need not be found to have caused the victim's death, but rather it must be shown that the murder was the result of the plan in which the defendant was a participant). D is incorrect. The supplier's belief that he had already killed the lookout is sufficient to prove that the supplier intended to cause the lookout's death.

The fact that the drugs were not actually stolen does not negate the fact that the woman believed they were stolen and that she intended to receive stolen property.

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement.

The woman, as trustee of the trust fund, held the $100,000 certificate of deposit in her trust and could not convert it to her own property for her own use without being guilty of embezzlement. The fact that she later invested the proceeds in another certificate of deposit and gave some money to charity does not change the fact that she embezzled the original $100,000. A is incorrect because the woman did not embezzle more than $100,000. The woman was trustee of a trust fund for the corpus of which the original $100,000 certificate of deposit was invested. Therefore, even though she invested the proceeds in another certificate of deposit, the value of the trust fund she embezzled was only the original $100,000. C is incorrect because the woman did not embezzle the amount she gave to charity. The woman is guilty of embezzlement for conversion of the fund's property to her own use, but she did not embezzle the amount given to charity, which was done after the embezzlement had occurred. D is incorrect because the woman did take trust funds for her own use, and therefore did commit embezzlement.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The woman, by drinking to a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit, acted with a depraved heart towards all persons with whom she might collide as a result of her intoxication, including the pedestrian she in fact killed. The court should give a depraved-heart homicide instruction, which would serve as a lesser-offense instruction to murder. Depraved-heart homicide is an form of murder that does not require proof of an intent-to-kill. Instead, it requires proof that the defendant acted with extreme recklessness towards human life. In this case, by getting behind the wheel of a car while extremely intoxicated, the woman acted with a depraved heart towards all persons with whom she might collide as a result of her intoxication. B is incorrect. In some jurisdictions, involuntary manslaughter may be charged where there is reckless or negligent action that leads to the death of another. However, the exact charge varies by jurisdiction and is thus not reliable as a lesser offense to murder. In this case, where the woman drove while extremely intoxicated, he acted with a depraved heart towards human life, and thus, an instruction for depraved-heart homicide would be the best choice. C is incorrect. The defense attorney should not request a voluntary intoxication instruction because it is not a lesser offense to murder. In addition, intoxication, whether voluntary or involuntary, has no influence upon the offense of depraved-heart murder. The woman's intoxication makes her act with a depraved heart, not with a reckless indifference to human life, which is required for manslaughter. D is incorrect. There is no instruction for voluntary manslaughter that the defense attorney can request. The woman's intoxication makes her act with a depraved heart, not with the malice aforethought required for murder. In addition, there is no instruction for voluntary manslaughter that the defense attorney can request. The woman's intoxication makes her act with a depraved heart, not with the malice aforethought required for murder."

On the facts described, a jury could potentially conclude that the woman did not act with the sort of aggravated recklessness necessary to constitute depraved-heart homicide or extreme-indifference murder, even though she was intoxicated and driving in an unlawful manner. Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself. Even if understood as the offense of \u201cpublic intoxication,\u201d this offense would be a poor choice because public intoxication is not a lesser included offense of murder.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

C is incorrect. A court must instruct on all lesser included offenses, but only if the offense is supported by the evidence presented at trial. In this case, there is sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find the defendant guilty of the greater offense but innocent of the lesser included offense of simple theft.

To be an accessory after the fact, the friend would have had to know that a crime had occurred and provided aid to the women with the intent to help them avoid punishment. He did not do this. He was merely a willing driver for the women. The friend did not intend to aid in the commission of a crime, nor did he have reasonable cause to believe that the women had committed a crime."

Through a window, the officers saw a man, whose hands were bleeding, shouting and throwing things, but no one else appeared to be present in the home. When the officers knocked on the door, the man refused to respond. The officers then asked if he needed medical assistance. The man told them to leave and not come back unless they had a warrant. The officers then entered the home, and the man pointed a shotgun at them. The officers withdrew but later arrested the man for felony assault on a police officer. Alleging that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment, the man has moved to suppress the officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the man lacks standing to complain of an entry under the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment.\nB. No, because the warrantless entry was reasonable under the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because officers cannot use the emergency aid exception to justify a warrantless entry when only the suspect himself needs aid.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. The emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement allows for warrantless entry when there is an exigent circumstance that requires police officers to provide aid and that there is no time to obtain a warrant. Here, the broken windows, glass on the ground, the blood-stained shirt, and the man's actions all led the officers to believe that there was an emergency that required their immediate attention. Additionally, the man's refusal to allow entry and his statement that the officers should not return unless they had a warrant, does not negate the fact that there was an emergency that required the officers\u2019 aid. Therefore, the warrantless entry was reasonable under the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment, and the man's motion to suppress should be denied. A is incorrect because, although the man may not have had a property or possessory interest in the premises (and thus may not have standing to challenge the warrantless entry on Fourth Amendment grounds), the reason the officers were there was to provide emergency aid, which was not triggered by the man's need for medical assistance but by the appearance of an ongoing emergency. C is incorrect because it is irrelevant whether only the suspect needs aid. The officers were not using the exception to justify entry to aid the suspect, but rather to aid others that they believed were in need of emergency aid. D is incorrect because it is an incorrect rule regarding the exclusionary rule. Even if the man had not invoked his right to a warrant, it would not mean that the evidence would be admissible at trial. The exclusionary rule only applies to evidence that was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Here, the evidence was obtained as a result of the officers\u2019 actions being reasonable under the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment, and thus, the evidence should be admissible at trial."

            "explanation": "D is correct. A charge of conspiracy requires that there exist an agreement to commit a crime, and that the co-conspirators intend to commit the crime. The man and his friend did not agree to commit a robbery, but rather to commit a battery. Battery does not require the use of force or the threat of force, but only intentional harmful contact. The friend's hiding in the bushes and jumping out in front of the woman, combined with the man's blocking the woman so that she would suffer harmful contact, constituted the agreement to commit battery. In addition, the man and the friend intended to commit battery. Therefore, the man and the friend were not guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery, and D is correct. A is incorrect because the man and his friend did not agree to commit armed robbery, and thus there was no conspiracy offense to that crime. The man and his friend did not agree to commit a robbery, but rather to commit a battery. In addition, the man and the friend did not intend to commit an armed robbery, but rather to commit a battery. The friend's threat of force was intended to be used to create the circumstances necessary to commit the battery, not to commit an armed robbery. B is incorrect because the man and his friend did not agree to commit a robbery, but rather to commit a battery. The friend's use of force was intended to create the circumstances necessary to commit the battery, not to commit a robbery. C is incorrect because the man and his friend did not agree to commit any crime involving the use or threat of force, and thus there was no agreement to commit a crime and no conspiracy offense was committed."

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD.

However, a decision not to investigate a defendant\u2019s background or present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of a death penalty case is not strategic, and counsel\u2019s failure to do so will be found to be ineffective assistance of counsel if there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
