            "explanation": "A is incorrect. The court only looks to where the company is incorporated and where it is headquartered to determine if there is diversity between the company and the shareholder. Where the company distributes its cars is irrelevant to determining diversity. B is incorrect. This choice confuses the issue of personal jurisdiction with the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, which is what is at issue in this question. The court only looks at where the company is incorporated to determine if there is diversity between the company and the shareholder; where the company has sufficient minimum contacts is irrelevant to determining diversity. C is correct. The court uses a test to determine if two parties are diverse, and one of the factors in that test is where the company is headquartered. D is incorrect. Similar to where the cars are distributed, where the company\u2019s major place of manufacturing is located is irrelevant to determining diversity. The court only looks to where the company is incorporated and where it is headquartered to determine if there is diversity between the company and the shareholder."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The complaint set out the bank\u2019s method of calculating interest and alleged that the method violated both federal banking law and state contract law. The bank filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that its method of calculating interest, as described in the complaint, was proper under federal law and that the federal law preempted the depositor\u2019s state-law claim. The court granted the motion to dismiss the depositor\u2019s federal claim and reserved ruling on the motion to dismiss the state-law claim. After completing discovery, the bank has moved to dismiss the state-law claim for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "A is correct. When a federal court determines that it has dismissed less than all of a plaintiff's federal claims, it must determine whether the remaining federal claim is so related to the federal claim that they form part of the same case or controversy as the dismissed federal claim. If they are, the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claim and may hear the state law claim. Here, the court must determine whether the state law claim is part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim that was dismissed. B is incorrect. Even though the state law claim is so related to the federal claim that they form part of the same case or controversy, a federal court still must determine whether it has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim. C is incorrect. The bank did not raise a federal defense to the state law claim; rather, it raised a preemption argument. D is incorrect. The claim here is not simply a diversity claim; it is a claim over which the court has supplemental jurisdiction."

            "question_number": 7,
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

            "explanation": "A is incorrect. Here, the second defendant was not joined as a party within 30 days after receipt of the complaint. When the second defendant was joined, the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint asserted a federal claim. However, for diversity jurisdiction, all defendants must be added by amendment within 30 days of receipt of the original complaint. Here, the original complaint was solely a state law claim and, therefore, not diversity jurisdiction. Only if the complaint had asserted diversity jurisdiction (and State A and State C were different from State B) and the second defendant had been joined in a timely manner, would diversity jurisdiction exist. B is correct. For a removal petition to be timely, it must be made within 30 days after receipt by the defendant of the initial complaint. Here, the second defendant was required to amend the initial complaint to add the first defendant and the complaint was not timely amended. As such, the removal was untimely. C is incorrect. The removal petition was untimely because it was not made within 30 days after receipt by the defendant of the initial complaint. Although the amended complaint asserted a federal claim, the defendant was not added as a party within 30 days after receipt of the initial complaint. D is incorrect. For diversity jurisdiction, all defendants must be added by amendment within 30 days after receipt of the complaint.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. An action is removable if it could have been originally filed in federal court. Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

The defendant travels to State A once each year for a weeklong vacation but has no other State A contacts. The defendant answered, denying all allegations. One week later, the defendant filed an amended answer, denying all allegations and including the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The defendant failed to raise the challenge to personal jurisdiction in her original answer, as required under Federal Rule 12. The defendant did raise the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, but only in an amended answer filed outside of 21 days after the initial answer was filed, which is not permitted under Federal Rule 15. Therefore, the defendant waived this defense. B is incorrect. This is not the test for determining whether service of process was proper under the federal rules. B lists a factual item as the test, but the test for determining whether service of process was proper under the federal rules is found in Federal Rule 4. Under this rule, service must be (1) upon an individual by (a) delivering the summons to him, (b) leaving the summons at his dwelling or usual place of abode with someone who is resident therein and of sufficient age to receive process, or (c) delivering the summons to an authorized agent of such individual who is designated by writing, as provided in section 4.01 of this rule, to receive service of process, or (d) using any form of service authorized by the law of the state in which service is made. This rule does not authorize service up to 100 miles from the federal courthouse. C is incorrect. The defendant has no minimum contacts with State A because she is domiciled in State B and the accident involved occurred in State C. However, the question of whether a court may assert personal jurisdiction over a defendant is separate from the question of whether a court may assert subject-matter jurisdiction over an action. Here, the court may assert subject-matter jurisdiction over the action because the action is a diversity action in which the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the action is not prohibited by the federal or State A long-arm statute. D is incorrect. This is not the test for determining whether service of process was proper under the federal rules. Under Federal Rule 4, service must be (1) upon an individual by (a) delivering the summons to him, (b) leaving the summons at his dwelling or usual place of abode with someone who is resident therein and of sufficient age to receive process, or (c) delivering the summons to an authorized agent of such individual who is designated by writing, as provided in section 4.01 of this rule, to receive service of process, or (d) using any form of service authorized by the law of the state in which service is made. For example, service may be made at the individual's office as was done in this case. In fact, the federal rules explicitly authorize use of any form of service authorized by state law, and many state laws authorize service at the individual's office."

The defendant is not domiciled in State A and only visits there periodically for reasons unrelated to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Answer A is incorrect. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h) permits litigants to raise personal-jurisdiction challenges for the first time in an answer that is amended as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1). Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants. Answer D is incorrect. Personal service under Rule 4 can occur at any location, not just the person\u2019s home.

Here, the plaintiff failed to effect proper service of process on the defendant, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 12. As such, the court should dismiss the action for this reason alone. B is incorrect. While it is true that a party must file proof of service, this is not the best answer because the plaintiff failed to effect proper service of process as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 12. Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal. C is incorrect. While it is true that, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a), the defendant has 60 days after service of the complaint to respond to the complaint after receiving a request to waive service of process, the defendant had 120 days to respond after service of the summons and complaint.

Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d), a summons can be served upon an agent of the defendant by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the agent and by mailing a copy of the summons to the defendant. The plaintiff complied with this rule in this case. However, service of process is only valid for 120 days after it is delivered to the party to be served. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c). In this case, the plaintiff failed to effect proper service of process as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 12.

Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect.

For diversity actions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a) provides that venue is proper in (1) where any defendant is found, (2) where any defendant has a home state or residence, or (3) where any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced. Here, the railroad is from State B, so the railroad has a home state of State B, and under \u00a7 1391(a)(2), venue is proper in State B.

For forum non conveniens reasons, the railroad would argue that the accident occurring in State B and many witnesses being located there would be a proper factor to consider in determining the motion to transfer. However, for venue reasons, the court must transfer the action to State B because that is where the railroad is subject to personal jurisdiction, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a) provides that venue is proper in State B.

Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

While notice of the hearing is required, it is not required that the organization and its leader receive notice that the hearing is taking place. Here, the US Attorney attached an affidavit to the complaint certifying that she had made efforts to locate the organization and its leader and to notify them of the motion. C is incorrect. The possibility of irreparable harm is the only requirement that must be shown to obtain a TRO, not the inadequacy of damages. D is incorrect. The TRO must be supported by a showing of (1) irreparable harm (2) is likely if the TRO is not issued and (3) the balance of equities favors the plaintiff and (4) there is some likelihood of success on the merits. While these requirements may be met in this case, the fourth requirement is not met because the order did not describe in reasonable detail the acts to be restrained and the order did not state the reasons for the issuance of the TRO."

In describing the events that led to the false accusations, the complaint quoted a statement of a competitor made to the employer about the worker\u2019s alleged theft. During discovery, the worker deposed the competitor. One week after discovery closed, the worker moved to amend the complaint to add the competitor as a defendant. The competitor opposed the motion on the ground that the statutory limitations period had expired. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery has closed, and the competitor will be prejudiced.\nB. No, because the amendment would not relate back and thus would be futile.\nC.

Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.",

If a party fails to object to a jury instruction before it is given, any error in the instruction may only be raised on appeal by showing that the error was plain and that it affected the defendant's substantial rights. See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993). Here, the defendant did not object to the instructions, so the plaintiff will argue that the error in the instructions was not plain. A is incorrect. Although A refers to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), which allows for reversal for plain error, this rule applies only when the error was not preserved. If the error had been preserved, the court might consider whether the error affected the defendant's substantial rights. Instead, the plaintiff will argue that the instructions were not plain error. B is incorrect. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 allows a party to move for a new trial based on error in the instructions. But here, the defendant is appealing the conviction, not moving for a new trial. Moreover, even if the defendant were to move for a new trial based on error in the instructions, he would not be required to do so before appealing. C is incorrect. The court has discretion in determining the form of jury instructions, but this discretion does not apply to whether the instructions are correct or incorrect. Rather, the court has discretion in whether to give particular instructions at all."

Answer B is incorrect. There is no obligation to seek a new trial before challenging jury instructions on appeal, so long as the applicable plain error standard can be satisfied.

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer D is incorrect.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC.

Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect.

The complaint alleged that the fire had been caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the house\u2019s electrical system in accordance with the applicable housing code. The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent. In opposition to that motion, the tenant argues that under federal law, contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defendant who wishes to assert the defense must plead in an answer or other responsive pleading. Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB. Federal law, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control pleading in federal court.\nC. State law, because the application of federal law would be outcome-determinative.\nD.

Rule 8(c)(1) is on point because it specifically provides that contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defending party must assert in its answer to the complaint. The rule is a valid exercise of the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power, because the manner of pleading defenses is an issue that can rationally be classified as procedure and the rule itself regulates the manner and means by which the parties\u2019 rights are enforced. Answer A is incorrect. The question of who has the burden of pleading, in contrast to the burden of proof, in federal actions is a procedural matter within the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power. Answer C is incorrect. The \u201coutcome determinative\u201d test applies only when asking whether a state rule that conflicts with a judge-made federal practice should be followed.

The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect.

The writ of habeas corpus is a writ of original jurisdiction for both federal and state courts, which means that any court can issue it and that it does not automatically go to the trial court. However, the writ can only be issued by a court that has jurisdiction over the case and the parties. In this case, the governor is in federal custody, and so a federal court would be the appropriate court to issue the writ. However, any court can issue a writ of habeas corpus, so the question is whether the state court or the federal court would be the proper court to issue the writ. The court that issued the warrant (in this case, the federal judge who issued the arrest warrant) is the court that has jurisdiction over the case and has the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus for someone in federal custody. Therefore, while a federal court would be the proper court to issue the writ, any court can issue it, and the state court in this case does have the power to issue the writ. However, the state court's power to issue the writ is invalid because the federal court that issued the warrant has jurisdiction over the case and is the court that should issue the writ.

A is incorrect because while only federal courts can issue habeas writs for individuals in federal custody, any court can issue a writ of habeas corpus, and the court that issued the warrant is the court that has jurisdiction over the case and the power to issue the writ.

D is incorrect because although the Constitution does guarantee the availability of habeas corpus, this does not mean that any court can issue a writ of habeas corpus against anyone at any time.

The statute authorizes the President to appoint the agency\u2019s director with the advice and consent of the Senate and prohibits the President from removing the director without the Senate\u2019s consent. The President appointed a director, and the Senate confirmed the appointment. Recently, the President has become dissatisfied with the director\u2019s strict approach to drug-law enforcement and wishes to remove the director. Because a majority of senators favor strict drug-law enforcement, the Senate has refused to consent to the director\u2019s removal. May the President constitutionally remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director\u2019s appointment and removal.\nB. No, because the President\u2019s removal of principal officers of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\nC. Yes, because congressional participation in the decision to remove a presidential appointee violates the separation of powers.\nD. Yes, because Congress cannot limit the ability of the President to remove any employee of the executive branch.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

Article II, \u00a7 3 provides that the President may remove principal officers with the advice and consent of the Senate, but there is no such limitation on the power of the President to remove persons who are not principal officers. The director is a creation of Congress appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is not a principal officer. Therefore, Congress cannot limit the ability of the President to remove the director. A is incorrect because Article I, \u00a7 8 gives Congress the power to create officers to execute its powers, but Article II, \u00a7 3 limits the power of the President to remove principal officers.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC.

            "explanation": "A is correct. For a claim to proceed under the Fourteenth Amendment, the plaintiff must have been deprived of property by a state or state actor. The Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to private actors unless they have become state actors by agreeing to provide some type of public function on behalf of the state. Here, the company is a private actor and has not agreed to perform a public function on behalf of the state. Therefore, the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply and the court should dismiss the action. B is incorrect. It does not matter whether the resident has paid some or all of his water bill; the issue here is whether the company can terminate service without giving the resident notice and an opportunity for a hearing. If the company's termination of service without notice and an opportunity for a hearing is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, then the resident is entitled to injunctive and monetary relief. C is incorrect. Even if the company were a state actor performing a public function, the Fourteenth Amendment would not require it to give residents an opportunity for a hearing before service is terminated. The Fourteenth Amendment requires a state or state actor to give notice and an opportunity for an hearing before it takes property, but such notice and hearing are not required where only a privilege to use the state's property is at issue. See Steele v. Longmeadow, 422 F. Supp. 112 (E.D. Ark. 1976). D is incorrect. Even if the resident's franchise with the company could characterize the resident as a state actor, the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to private franchises granted by public entities."

However, the law does not classify on the basis of citizenship or residence; it classifies only on the basis of a state license that is available equally to citizens and residents. Therefore, the law does not violate the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV. Additionally, the law does not violate the clause because it is not a burden on interstate commerce. The test to determine whether a law violates the privileges and immunities clause is 1) whether the state had a legitimate interest in enacting the law, and 2) whether the law is rationally related to that interest. Here, the state had a legitimate interest in ensuring the high quality of tutors in state public schools, and the law is rationally related to that interest. Therefore, A is correct and B is incorrect. B is incorrect because the test is not whether the law is substantially related to an important state interest, but whether the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

Sterilization is a fundamental right, and the equal protection clause requires sterilization requirements in criminal statutes to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. However, because the stereotype that all persons convicted of sex offenses are dangerous and that they should be sterilized is widely accepted, it will be very difficult to show that the requirement is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Therefore, this is not the strongest argument. B is correct. The requirement of sterilization has a disproportionate impact on men, and it is not substantially related to an important governmental interest. This is an argument under the equal protection clause based on gender, which is very strongly favored by the courts, and would be the strongest argument. C is incorrect. The requirement of sterilization has a disproportionate impact on racial minorities, and it is not substantially related to an important governmental interest. While this would be a strong argument under the equal protection clause, the statistics provided in the problem do not support the argument that the law has a disproportionate impact on racial minorities. Therefore, this cannot be the strongest argument. D is incorrect. The requirement of sterilization is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. While this would be a strong argument, the courts are very deferential to choices by legislators, and would require a great deal of evidence before finding that the requirement is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.

But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect. It states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not applicable in this case. The state sterilization requirement would receive strict judicial scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation.",

On numerous occasions, the wife\u2019s brother had offered to buy the farm from her, but she had always refused. The husband died suddenly in an accident. The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children. What would be the wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Duress.\nB. Mistake.\nC. Unconscionability.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. The brother took advantage of the wife\u2019s vulnerable state to get her to agree to sell the farm. The wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract is that it was the product of undue influence. Under the doctrine of undue influence, a court may find a contract voidable by a party if that party was in a vulnerable state when the contract was made and if the other party took advantage of that vulnerable state to obtain the contract. The wife was vulnerable due to the recent death of her husband and the need to care for their four children. The brother took advantage of those circumstances by pressuring the wife to sign the offer to purchase quickly and by failing to disclose information that would have affected the wife\u2019s decision (that the husband had a life insurance policy). A is incorrect. Duress requires a threat of unlawful force, and the brother\u2019s conduct here did not involve a threat of unlawful force. B is incorrect. A mistake must be one of fact, and while the wife made a mistake here, it was a mistake of law, not fact. She thought she needed to sell the farm, but she was wrong to think so. C is incorrect. A contract may be unconscionable at the time that it is made, but a court will not rescind a contract on unconscionability grounds if the party seeking rescission could have reasonably anticipated the unconscionable terms when the contract was formed. Here, the wife could have reasonably anticipated that she would find out she didn\u2019t need to sell the farm and should not be able to rescind the contract on unconscionability grounds."

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract.

Therefore B is incorrect. When a contract is silent on a particular issue or there is ambiguity in the language of the contract, the contract may be construed against the party who drafted the language that gave rise to the ambiguity.

The appraiser told the heir that he had no expertise in appraising art and recommended that she hire an art appraiser to value the painting. The heir, doubting that the painting was valuable, declined to follow the appraiser\u2019s advice and decided to sell the painting at a yard sale. She set the price at $100, assuming that this price reflected the painting\u2019s approximate value. A neighbor, who knew nothing about art, purchased the painting from the heir at the asking price. The neighbor and the heir later discovered that the painting was worth over $900,000. Would the heir be likely to prevail in an action to rescind the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the heir bore the risk of any mistake as to the true value of the painting.\nB. No, because the neighbor possessed no specialized knowledge of the true value of the painting.\nC. Yes, because enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable, given its disadvantageous impact on the heir.\nD.

            "explanation": "B is correct. Where a party's mistake relates to a material aspect of the contract, and the mistake renders enforcement of the contract unconscionable, that party may avoid the contract. Here, the heir's mistake as to the value of the painting relates to a material aspect of the contract, and enforcement of the contract would have an extremely disadvantageous impact on her. Therefore, she may avoid the contract on grounds of unconscionability. To determine whether enforcement of a contract would be unconscionable, the court considers whether the terms of the contract are unreasonably favorable to one of the parties. In determining whether the terms of a contract are unreasonably favorable to a party, the court considers factors such as the presence of fraud or coercion and whether a party took advantage of a lesser sophisticated party. Also relevant is whether a party's mistake relates to a material aspect of the contract. In general, a mistake will be considered material if the parties deemed it important or if it related to the purpose of the contract. Here, the heir's mistake related to the value of the painting, which was a central aspect of the contract. Therefore, the choice between A and C is irrelevant; the heir's mistake was material and therefore enforceability of the contract is unconscionable. The correct basis for the heir's recovery, however, is unconscionability rather than mistake, so C is a better answer. D is incorrect because the heir did not rely on the mistaken assumption sufficient to alter the risks and duties of the contract. Rather, the heir's mistake rendered enforcement of the contract unconscionable. Similarly, A and C are incorrect because the mutual mistake related to a material aspect of the contract and enforcement of the contract is unconscionable. B is correct because it fails to take a stance on the best basis to support the heir's recovery."

Despite the engineer\u2019s best efforts, however, the county did not approve the project. Because of this outcome, the developer refused to pay the engineer for any of the engineer\u2019s services. In a breach of contract action by the engineer against the developer, which party will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The developer, because an express condition to the developer\u2019s performance obligation failed to occur.\nB. The developer, because the engineer breached the contract by failing to obtain the county\u2019s approval of the project.\nC. The engineer, because the developer breached the contract by not paying once the developer\u2019s obligation to pay the engineer became due.\nD.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Under the UCC, a duty of performance is excused if performance is impracticable due to the occurrence of an event the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract. Here, the engineer completed his duties under the contract, but the project's approval by the county, which was a basic assumption of the contract, did not occur due to no fault of the engineer. The fact that the engineer used his best efforts to obtain approval of the project, as required by the contract, when viewed in conjunction with the fact that the project was not approved, suggests that the nonoccurrence of the approval was the result of an event beyond the engineer's control. Therefore, the engineer has a valid excuse under the UCC for his failure to obtain the project's approval. Accordingly, the engineer has another valid excuse, this one for the nonoccurrence of an express condition, for the developer's failure to pay the engineer. Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect. The failure of an express condition to an obligation under a contract excuses a party's performance if the condition's failure was the result of the other party's breach or, under the UCC, where the nonoccurrence of the condition is the nonoccurrence of an event the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract, and the nonoccurrence of the condition was the result of an event beyond the first party's control. When a condition's failure excuses a performance, the nonoccurrence of the condition is treated as if it had occurred in favor of the other party. Therefore, where a condition's failure to occur excuses a performance, there is no longer an express condition the nonoccurrence of which the first party is obligated to satisfy. Instead, the other party is obligated to satisfy his or her own performance obligation. In this case, the engineer completed his duties under the contract, and the project's approval by the county was the only condition the nonoccurrence of which excused the engineer's performance obligation. Because the project was not approved, and this failure was the result of an event beyond the engineer's control, the failure to obtain the project's approval excused the engineer's performance obligation. As such, there is no longer an express condition the nonoccurrence of which the developer is obligated to satisfy. Instead, the developer is obligated to satisfy his own performance obligation, which is to pay the engineer $10,000. B is incorrect. As explained above, the engineer has a valid excuse under the UCC for his failure to obtain the project's approval. In any case, the contract between the engineer and the developer required the engineer to use his best efforts to obtain the project's approval. As such, the contract did not require the engineer to succeed in obtaining the project's approval, but only that he use his best"

The firm\u2019s bid included a subcontractor\u2019s bid to complete the electrical work on the plant for $100,000. The municipality awarded the construction contract to the firm. Later that day, before the firm told the subcontractor of the award, the subcontractor told the firm that it was withdrawing its bid because it had recently undertaken a new project that would absorb all its capacity for the next 18 months. The firm nevertheless accepted the subcontractor\u2019s bid and demanded that it perform the electrical work on the plant, but the subcontractor refused. The firm had to hire another subcontractor to perform the electrical work, at a cost of $115,000. The firm completed the construction of the plant at a profit. Which of the following statements correctly describes the firm\u2019s legal rights, if any, against the first subcontractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The firm is entitled to recover nominal damages only, because it completed the construction at a profit.\nB. The firm is entitled to recover reliance damages, because it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid when it submitted its own bid to the municipality.\nC.

Further, a subcontractor is free to withdraw its bid at any time and is not liable for its withdrawal. Therefore, the engineering firm had no right to expect the subcontractor to perform the electrical work, and the subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid did not give rise to a claim for damages. A is incorrect because the engineering firm suffered no damage as a result of the subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid. Although the firm did hire another subcontractor to perform the electrical work at a higher cost, the firm completed the project at a profit and suffered no harm. B is incorrect because the firm was not justified in relying on the subcontractor's bid. Although the firm may have detrimentally relied on the subcontractor's bid, its reliance damages are barred because the subcontractor's bid was not accepted by the engineering firm before the subcontractor withdrew its bid. C is incorrect because a bid is not considered a promise that is enforceable in contract, and therefore there is no time during which a bid may only be revoked with liability."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

In return for his daughter\u2019s promise to pay $300,000 to his nephew at the time of the father\u2019s death, the father executed and delivered to his daughter a quitclaim deed to the land. The daughter took possession of the land. Two years later, in a signed writing, the father directed his daughter to pay to a neighbor, at the father\u2019s death, $50,000 of the $300,000 that was to go to the nephew. The daughter, who had long disliked the neighbor, told her father that she did not plan to honor his request. The father died, and his daughter has since refused to pay anything to either the nephew or the neighbor. The neighbor has sued the daughter for the $50,000. Is the neighbor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter did not consent to any modification of the contract she had made with her father.\nB. No, because the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, and the nephew\u2019s interest could not be modified without his express written consent.\nC. Yes, because the father retained a transferable interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise.\nD. Yes, because the father\u2019s signed modification is enforceable without consideration.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

            "explanation": "Under the common law, a parent cannot assign their rights under an existing contract, nor can they unilaterally modify an existing contract to which they are a party. In recognition of the unique relationship between a parent and child, many states apply a more liberal approach to contracts between parents and children. Under this approach, a parent's retention of a future interest in their child's promise is sufficient to make the promise enforceable. Therefore, answer C is correct. Answer A is incorrect because many states allow parents to unilaterally modify contracts with their children. Answer B is incorrect because the nephew was only a intended beneficiary, not an expressed third party beneficiary. In order to enforce a right as an intended beneficiary, the nephew would have had to bring an action on the original contract. Answer D is incorrect because the modification was supported by consideration - the father's retention of a right to $50,000 from his daughter's future proceeds."

Here, the daughter did not agree to the modification and the father provided no consideration. Answer B is incorrect. Even though the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, the nephew\u2019s consent was not required for modification unless the contract provided otherwise. Here, however, there was no modification of the contract, because the daughter did not agree to it. Answer C is incorrect. The father retained no interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise, and thus he could not alter her obligation without her consent. Answer D is incorrect. There was no effective modification, because the daughter did not agree to it. Furthermore, the general common law rule is that a modification requires consideration, and here there was no consideration from the father.",

            "explanation": "A is correct. The company has no duty to the homeowner to screen users or the content of their postings. Without a legal duty, the company cannot be held liable for the cousin\u2019s actions. B is incorrect. The cousin\u2019s actions were not, as a matter of law, a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. It is possible that the homeowner would have lost the same furnishings even if the company had no website or if the notice had not been posted. Whether or not the company\u2019s website was a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss is a question for the jury. C is incorrect. The First Amendment does not prohibit all tort actions based on speech. Superficially, this seems to be a First Amendment issue because the company provides a forum for free speech. However, the company\u2019s providing a forum for free speech does not mean that the company has no legal duty to prevent misuse of that forum. Torts based on negligence, such as defamation, do not conflict with the First Amendment. Defamation is determined by state law, and the First Amendment only sets boundaries on what can be recovered as damages. If the company had intentionally targeted the homeowner with a false statement, the homeowner would not be able to bring a defamation claim under the First Amendment. But in this case, there is no intentional targeting, and the action is for negligence, not defamation. Therefore the First Amendment does not prevent the homeowner from bringing a negligence action. D is incorrect. There is no evidence of careless conduct by the company. However, the company\u2019s strongest defense is that it had no legal duty to the homeowner, so the company\u2019s careless conduct is irrelevant."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

The motorcycle hit a tire that had fallen off a truck driven by a delivery company employee who was making a delivery to an address on the private road. The boy was injured when his motorcycle went out of control after striking the tire. In a negligence action brought on behalf of the boy against the delivery company, the company contends that the boy was contributorily negligent and that his damages, if any, should be reduced in conformance with the jurisdiction\u2019s comparative negligence statute. The boy argues that his conduct should be judged according to the standard of a reasonable child of like age, intelligence, and experience under the circumstances. Is the boy entitled to be judged according to the standard of care that he has argued for?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the boy was driving a motorcycle.\nB.

The boy was a minor at the time of the incident, and he will be held to the reasonable person standard of care applicable to children of his age, intelligence, and experience only. A is incorrect. The fact that the boy was driving a motorcycle does not determine the standard of care that will be applied to him, although it may be considered in determining whether he met that standard. B is incorrect. The fact that the boy was a trespasser also does not determine the standard of care that will be applied to him, although it may be considered in determining whether he met that standard. If the boy had been an adult trespasser, the fact that he was a trespasser would support a finding of contributory negligence. However, because the boy was a minor, he will be held to the reasonable person standard of care applicable to children of his age, intelligence, and experience, and not to the strict standard of an adult trespasser. C is incorrect. The application of comparative negligence does not determine the standard of care that a plaintiff must meet in order to prevail in his action. Instead, it determines how the negligence of a plaintiff will affect his recovery in cases where he has been injured by the negligence of more than one defendant. In this case, the determination of whether the boy will be held to the standard of care of a reasonable child of his age and experience, or whether he will be held to the strict standard of an adult, will not involve the application of comparative negligence."

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB. No, because the former employee could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts.\nC.

The former high-level employee of the established cemetery knows that any purchaser of a funeral plan can cancel that plan at any time, subject to a penalty of up to 15% of the purchase price.

There is no evidence of improper motive on the part of the former employee. B is incorrect. Interference with contract requires either improper motive or an interference that is otherwise improper under the circumstances. Here, the cemetery\u2019s contracts are terminable at the will of the purchaser, so there is no protected expectation that the contracts will remain in place.

After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable.

The United States Supreme Court has held that, at a minimum, a punitive damages award must be proportionate to the actual harm caused to the plaintiff in order not to violate a defendant's right to due process. Additionally, the award should not be grossly excessive in relation to the damages a victim suffered. Here, compensatory award of $3 million seems excessive in relation to the actual harm caused to the patient given his limited recovery time and the fact that he died from the cancer within four months. Therefore, the award of $21 million in punitive damages is likely to be vacated on appeal as being grossly excessive in relation to the compensatory award. A is incorrect. While the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages of 7 to 1 has been held not to violate a defendant's right to due process, the ratio of 93 to 1 here likely does. B is incorrect. While it may be appropriate to award punitive damages in cases of medical malpractice that result in death or serious injury, doing so does not justify an excessive award of punitive damages. When the award of punitive damages is found to be excessive in relation to the harm caused to the plaintiff, the award will be vacated on appeal. D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The buyer has acted unreasonably in light of the extreme measure the employee had implemented in repudiating her request and in light of the nondeadly nature of the force the buyer had available to her. Therefore, a fact-finder could conclude that the buyer was not acting to protect her property interests when she became violent, and could instead conclude that the buyer was seeking to inflict harm on the employee. Thus, the buyer did not use the privilege of self-defense, and instead intended to inflict harm under the circumstances. B is incorrect. Even after she handed over the keys, the buyer had a privilege to protect her property from the unlawful repossession. In fact, a possessor is privileged to use nonlethal force to protect his or her property from unlawful taking. C is incorrect. While a possessor can use nonlethal force to protect his or her property from trespassers and unlawful takings, a possessor who is himself a trespasser has no such right to defend his property from the force being used to oust him. In this case, the buyer was not a trespasser with respect to the car because she had an interest in the car at the time that the employee arrived to repossess it. However, a fact-finder could find that the buyer's loss of possession of the car through the execution of the contract had made her no more than a licensee, so that her actions constituting force against the employee were excessive under the circumstances. D is incorrect. The privilege to protect property from unlawful takings does not extend to the use of nonlethal force. Therefore, even if a fact-finder were to find that the buyer had acted reasonably under the circumstances, the buyer would not have had the right to use any force against the employee and would therefore not have had the right to inflict this level of harm. Instead, the buyer should have sought help from law enforcement."

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The buyer intentionally shoved the employee, which satisfies the prima facie case for battery. As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

Frightened, a passenger pried the inside doors open and impulsively stuck his arm through them to try to stop the fall. As a result, his arm was broken. The elevator eventually stopped without causing further injuries. In a negligence action brought by the injured passenger against the company that installed and maintained the elevator, the injured passenger has asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that it may find the company negligent on a theory of res ipsa loquitur. In response, the company has argued that the passenger\u2019s conduct caused his injuries. How should the judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

C and D are incorrect. The court should not give a cautionary instruction where the res ipsa loquitur instruction should not be given at all.

Here, the bystander's contact with the man was for the purpose of protecting the man from himself, and was thus done with privilege. Additionally, when the bystander locked the man in the room, the bystander had the man's consent to do so, which cuts off any false imprisonment claim the man may have had.

On the day he arrived, just after sunset, he took his bag upstairs to a second-floor bedroom and unpacked. As he was about to head back downstairs, he realized that the stairwell had become too dark to navigate without a light. The man spent about 30 seconds feeling the walls at the top of the stairwell but could not find a light switch. In fact, the switch was located in an awkward position not reachable without descending to the second step. Although he recognized the danger of descending an unfamiliar staircase in darkness, the man started down the stairs. He lost his footing halfway down, fell, and was seriously injured.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The instruction in A appropriately addresses the issue of comparative negligence as it applies to the man's assumption of risk. The jury must determine the extent to which the owner was negligent in failing to light the stairway and the extent to which the man assumed the risk of walking down a dark stairway. The jury must also determine whether the man's assumption of the risk was a cause in fact and a legal cause of his injury. If the jury finds that the man assumed the risk, the court must then determine what percentage of responsibility to assign to the man under the comparative negligence rules of the jurisdiction. B is incorrect. It provides that the man's assumption of risk, if established, would be a complete bar to recovery, as the traditional common law defense required. The majority of states have rejected the traditional common law defense of assumption of risk, and most jurisdictions that recognize assumption of risk as a defense apply some form of comparative negligence analysis. C is incorrect. The instruction in C refers to the common law distinction between invitees, licensees, and trespassers, which has been rejected by the majority of states. The majority of states treat business guests as either invitees, who are entitled to recover for negligence, or as mere visitors, who are not. D is incorrect. The instruction in D refers to the hybrid damage instruction that applies in contributory negligence jurisdictions. The majority of states now apply some form of comparative negligence rather than contributory negligence."

Because the rocket was fired by the amusement park, and struck the spectator with a part of the rocket, a battery claim by the spectator against the amusement park will survive. The amusement park, by intentionally acting to bring about harmful or offensive contact, will be found liable for battery. A is incorrect. Abnormally dangerous activities are ultrahazardous and give rise to strict liability. However, the activity must be abnormally dangerous and this is fact specific. The facts do not indicate that the amusement park's operation of the fireworks display was abnormally dangerous, rather than simply dangerous. C is incorrect. The amusement park's use of the rockets as part of the fireworks display, while it may have created some noise and caused some harm, does not rise to the level of a nuisance.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "explanation": "D is correct. Private nuisance focuses on whether the defendant's activity has caused an interference with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff's property. To establish a prima facie case of private nuisance, the plaintiff must show: 1) interference with use and enjoyment of land 2) which is substantial 3) which is unreasonable. The plaintiff is not required to show financial loss. Instead the plaintiff can show that the interference is unreasonable by demonstrating that it is substantial and that the defendant's activity has caused an interference with the use and enjoyment of the land. Therefore, because unsightly conditions do not cause an interference with the use and enjoyment of neighboring land, the farmer's best argument is that the homeowner has failed to establish an interference with the use and enjoyment of her land. A is incorrect. Although the appraisal determined that there had been no diminution in value to the homeowner's property, a decrease in value is not required to establish a nuisance. B is incorrect. Interference with a neighbor's use and enjoyment of their land does not require physical invasion. C is incorrect. Whether the interference is common or unusual, it must still be determined whether the interference is substantial and unreasonable."

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

            "explanation": "B is correct. The evidence of the defendant's purchase of an airplane ticket to a foreign country using an alias is relevant to show two facts of consequence: the defendant's consciousness of guilt and his intent to avoid the law. When a defendant takes actions designed to avoid detection or to prevent the collection of evidence, it is relevant to show his guilt. Here, the purchase of a plane ticket using an alias is relevant to show that the defendant was aware of the charge against him and was consciounous of his guilt. In addition, the defendant's actions to leave the country are relevant to show his intent to distribute the cocaine. If the defendant intended to possess the cocaine solely for personal use, he would not take such actions. Therefore, the evidence is relevant to both the conspiracy charge and the intent to distribute charge. Thus, A is incorrect. C is incorrect because, although the evidence is relevant to show consciousness of guilt, that alone is not sufficient to charge conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute. The evidence is also relevant to show the intent to distribute. Therefore, C is incorrect and B is correct. D is incorrect because the evidence, although relevant to show motive, is also relevant to show consciousness of guilt and intent to distribute. Therefore, the evidence is not admissible only on the grounds of motive."

Evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to flee satisfies FRE 401\u2019s definition of relevance: it shows his consciousness of guilt and makes his guilt more probable than it would be without the evidence.

However, the document is not \"disclosed\" for waiver purposes unless it is viewed by the opposing party or otherwise otherwise disseminated. Here, the two documents were not \"disclosed\" to the woman because she was not supposed to see them and took no affirmative steps to learn their contents. The woman did not, for example, query the manufacturer about the absence of communications between the president and counsel in documents that were turned over to her. The manufacturer has not waived the attorney-client privilege as to the two documents and may seek a protective order to prevent any waiver as to the 23 documents that were in existence but not disclosed to the woman. B is incorrect. As stated above, there was no disclosure here that would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. C is incorrect. As stated above, there was no disclosure here that would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. Even if the woman had information about the existence of 23 other documents covering the same subject matter that were not turned over to her, there was no disclosure of the 25 documents constituting a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. D is incorrect. Here, the federal court is applying state law as the rule of decision, so the choice of law rules of the state would apply. However, the state choice of law rules would not allow application of the state law on waiver if it conflicted with federal public policy, and in any event, the federal common law on waiver would apply here. As stated above, the woman was not entitled to the documents, did not query the manufacturer about the absence of documents, and otherwise did not disseminate or otherwise learn the contents of the two documents. There was no \"disclosure\" here that would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege."

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the contractor and the homeowner, because neither posted a warning that the porch boards had been loosened.\nB. Neither the homeowner nor the contractor, because the friend was a licensee.\nC.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph \u201cis what the proponent claims it is.\u201d The witness\u2019s proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw it.

When a hearsay statement - other than a statement under Rule 803(1), the catchall exception - has been admitted in evidence, the hearsay status of a statement that would otherwise be admissible cannot be challenged on the ground that the statement is hearsay, as Rule 806 provides that \"hearsay within hearsay\" is admissible to prove the hearsay statement if the underlying hearsay itself is admissible. Thus, the defendant here cannot make a hearsay objection to the rival\u2019s statement to the police because the rival\u2019s statement is admissible (as a statement of the then existing mental or emotional condition of the rival, under Rule 803(3)). However, the defendant does have a confrontation right under Crawford v. Washington, because the rival\u2019s statement is hearsay (it is an out-of-court statement that is offered for the truth of the matter asserted). That confrontation right does not arise, however, until the hearsay has been admitted into evidence, and it cannot be challenged on the ground that the statement is hearsay, as Rule 806 provides that \"hearsay within hearsay\" is admissible to prove the hearsay statement if the underlying hearsay itself is admissible.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The stockholder's opinion that the stock price drop was directly caused by the public revelation about the false earnings reports is rationally based on his perception as a stockholder, and will be helpful to the trier of fact. To be admissible, an opinion must be (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to the trier of fact. Here, the stockholder's opinion satisfies both requirements. As a stockholder, he perceived the public revelation about the false earnings reports and believes, rationally, that the stock price drop was directly caused by that revelation. His opinion is also helpful to the trier of fact because it provides an assessment of the cause of the stock price drop from the perspective of a stockholder. Thus, the stockholder's opinion satisfies the requirements of Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. A is incorrect. Rule 701 does not require a witness to be qualified on a particular subject before his opinion is admissible. D is incorrect. There is no rule of evidence that automatically entitles a property owner to express an opinion on changes in the value of their property. The opinion must still satisfy the requirements of Rule 701."

Under FRE 701, the stockholder\u2019s testimony is inadmissible.   Answer B is incorrect. If otherwise qualified, an expert witness can have a personal interest in the outcome of the action and still testify. The expert\u2019s personal interest can be explored on cross-examination. In this case, however, the stockholder is not qualified as an expert. Answer C is incorrect. An admissible opinion about the cause of the price drop cannot be based on the stockholder\u2019s perception; it requires an expertise that he does not possess. His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue. Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 701, property owners are entitled to express opinions on the value of their property, but here the stockholder is expressing an opinion on the cause of the publicly traded stock\u2019s price drop.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The woman\u2019s statement to the police officer that she had obtained the cocaine from the defendant is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that the defendant sold cocaine to the woman. Therefore, it is hearsay. The woman's statement does not meet the requirements of any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Although the woman's statement is an admission by a party opponent, it is not a statement that would be offered against the woman in a criminal trial, because she has left the country and is unavailable to the defendant. Therefore, the statement does not meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), the declaration against interest exception to the hearsay rule. B is incorrect. The woman's statement to the police officer is hearsay, and it is not admissible simply because the woman is unavailable to testify at trial. There is no exception to the hearsay rule that allows for the admission of hearsay statements from an unavailable witness. C is incorrect. The woman's statement to the police officer is hearsay, and it is not admissible as a statement by the defendant's coconspirator. Although the statement may have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy, there is no evidence that the police officer was working with the woman as part of a joint venture or conspiracy at the time that the woman made the statement to him. In addition, even if there were evidence that the woman and the police officer were working together as part of a joint venture or conspiracy, the woman's statement to the police officer would still need to meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), the coconspirator rule. There is no evidence that the police officer knew about the conspiracy before the woman told him about it, and there is no evidence that the cocaine that the woman was arrested with was related to the conspiracy between the defendant and the woman. D is incorrect. The woman's statement to the police officer is hearsay, and it is not admissible as a declaration against interest. Although the statement is clearly against the woman's interest in the sense that it incriminates her, the statement is not against her interest at the time that it was made in the sense that it would subject her to civil or criminal liability. In addition, even if it could be said that the woman's statement was against her interest at the time that it was made, the statement would still need to meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), which requires that the declarant be unavailable to testify at trial. Although the woman may be unavailable to testify at trial because she has left the country, the prosecutor should have tried to procure her attendance at trial before the woman's statement could be admitted under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3)."

There is no hearsay exception that would apply to admit her statement against the defendant. Answer B is incorrect. The prosecutor\u2019s failure to establish the woman\u2019s unavailability is not the reason that her statement is inadmissible. Because there is no hearsay exception that would make the woman\u2019s statement admissible to prove its truth, it would be inadmissible even if the prosecutor were to properly establish her unavailability. Answer C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement was made to a police officer following her arrest and not during a drug conspiracy with the defendant. The statement also certainly did nothing to further a drug conspiracy, even if one did exist. Answer D is incorrect. The portion of the woman\u2019s statement attributing fault to the defendant and suggesting that he was her drug supplier was not against the woman\u2019s penal interest. Indeed, once she was apprehended, her statement   shifted blame to the defendant and away from herself and was in fact self-serving.",

            "explanation": "D is correct. For items to be admitted into evidence, they must be authenticated or identified as what the proponent of the item claims it to be. The authentication or identification of an item may be made by anyone who is familiar with the item, including the proponent's witness. In this case, the law enforcement officer who found the items in the apartment is familiar with the items and can authenticate them. The standard for authentication is a preponderance of the evidence. A preponderance of the evidence is evidence that shows that the position being supported is more likely to be true than the opposing position. The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" refers to the burden of persuasion, which is a question of fact in civil cases. Here, the burden of persuasion for authentication of the items of evidence being offered is on the proponent of the evidence, which is the prosecution. Therefore, the standard the court should use is whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the items in question are what the prosecution claims them to be. A is incorrect because the standard referred to is for civil cases, not criminal cases. The standard for authentication of evidence does not require that the prosecution make a clear and convincing showing that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be. B is incorrect because while a chain of custody is important in authentication of tangible items, it is not the only way to authenticate the items, and the standard for authentication is a preponderance of the evidence. C is incorrect because the standard referred to is for civil cases, not criminal cases. The standard for authentication of evidence does not require that the prosecution show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be."

A finding by the court that the prosecution has made a clear and convincing showing that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be is not required.

Proof of chain of custody\u2014what happened to the evidence after it was initially seized from the apartment\u2014is one way of authenticating evidence, but it is not necessary here, since the prosecution has called a witness who will testify that he saw each of the items in the apartment.

When a witness denies making a prior statement, \"the statement is admissible to impeach the witness's trial testimony only if the prior statement was explicitly made by the witness while believing itself to be in the presence of an agent or representative of an opposing party.\" Here, the witness's out-of-court statement was explicitly made to an investigator, who was an agent for the defendant, an opposing party. Therefore, the witness's prior inconsistent statement is admissible only to impeach the witness's trial testimony and not for its truth. A is incorrect.

It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose.

Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect.

See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect.

She kept one lot for herself, conveyed another to her daughter, and conveyed the remaining lot to her son. Each conveyance was by a deed of gift containing a covenant specifying that only one single-story home could be constructed on the conveyed lot in order to preserve views of a nearby lake from the mother\u2019s lot. The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot. Several years later, the son conveyed his vacant lot to a purchaser using a warranty deed that made no mention of the covenant in the previous deed from the mother. The purchaser promptly recorded her deed. When the purchaser later began constructing a three-story house similar to the mother\u2019s, the mother sued to enjoin the construction. Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, since she herself constructed a three-story house.\nB. No, because there was no consideration given for the covenants in the deeds of gift.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. The restriction described in the facts is a equitable servitude. An equitable servitude in a deed runs with the land under three exceptions: where a party \"touches and concerns\" the land, where the servitude \"touches and concerns\" the original conveyance (in other words, it affects the title being conveyed), or where the servitude is \"affixed to the land as a result of some act or agreement of the original parties.\" Here, the mother son equitable servitude \"touches and concerns\" the original conveyance because it affects the title being conveyed. In addition, the servitude \"touches and concerns\" the land because it mentions a specific plot of land (\"only one single-story home can be constructed on the conveyed lot\"). And, while the mother constructed a three-story house in contravention of the servitude, the servitude still \"concerns\" the land because the mother's actions do not negate the title interest that the servitude affects. Therefore, the servitude will run with the land, and the purchaser will be bound by the restriction. Because the servitude runs with the land, the purchaser's construction of a three-story house is a violation of the restriction that the mother is entitled to enforce. An injunction is the appropriate remedy to enforce the restriction, so C is correct. A is incorrect because the mother is not estopped from enforcing the covenant. The mother's construction of a three-story house does not negate the title interest that the servitude affects, so the servitude still applies to the land. B is incorrect because consideration is not required for the covenants in the deeds of gift. A promise to make a transfer of land is sufficient consideration to support a return promise, even if the promise is not performed. D is incorrect because the mother and son are in privity of estate, not privity of contract. Privity of contract refers to two parties who stand in contractual relationship with each other, while privity of estate refers to two parties who stand in a landowner-tenant relationship with each other."

The burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house), and the benefit was on her retained lot (to preserve her view of the lake). The equitable servitude was in writing and was recorded, providing constructive notice of it; actual notice was not required. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house) and the benefit was on the mother\u2019s retained lot, the benefit does not limit the mother to building only a one-story house. The mother was permitted to build a three-story house on her lot without being estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser of the son\u2019s lot. Answer B is incorrect. The son did receive his lot by a deed of gift, and no consideration was given. The mother created an equitable servitude, which may be by deed of gift, when she conveyed the third lot to her son, and that deed was recorded, giving constructive notice of the servitude.

The listing agreement was not recorded. The list price for the house was $250,000.

When a broker produces a ready, willing, and able buyer during the term of a listing agreement, the broker is entitled to a commission whether or not the buyer actually purchases the property. Although the buyer was prequalified for a $249,000 loan, it is unclear whether the buyer was ready, willing, and able to purchase the woman's house. However, the fact that the woman rejected the buyer's offer and the listing agreement expired the next day without the woman assigning the contract and taking advantage of the doctrine of impossibility, means that the buyer was ready, willing, and able to enter into the contract for the house. Therefore, the broker is entitled to the commission. A is incorrect. A real estate broker's listing agreement with a property owner gives the broker exclusive rights to attempt to find a buyer for the property during the term of the agreement, but the agreement need not be recorded in order to be valid. B is incorrect. When a broker produces a ready, willing, and able buyer during the term of a listing agreement, the broker is entitled to a commission, even if another buyer is later found outside of the agreement and for a lower price. D is incorrect. When a property owner rejects a buyer's offer without giving a reason, the owner will be precluded from asserting certain defenses against the buyer if the buyer enters into a contract to purchase the property. However, this rule does not require the owner to pay the broker's commission if the listing agreement has expired or if another buyer was later found."

An executory interest is a provision in a will that states what happens to a particular bequest if the beneficiary of that bequest marries or otherwise becomes re-united with a former spouse. Executory interests only work with interests in property, and they only work while the person who created the interest is alive. In this case, the woman created an executory interest by bequeathing her home to her nephew \"on the date of his marriage.\" This means that as long as the woman was alive, the nephew had no interest in the home; it would only pass to him if he were married at the time of her death. Therefore, the nephew had no interest in the home at the time of the woman's death, so answer B is correct. A is incorrect because the nephew\u2019s recording of the deed did not create an interest in the home; it only provided notice to third parties of his potential future interest.

The contract provided that the closing would occur at the office of the seller\u2019s attorney 30 days after the date of the contract. Twenty days later, the buyer asked the seller if the closing could be postponed for 15 days beyond the scheduled closing date. The seller authorized her attorney to email the buyer saying that the closing date would be extended for 15 days but that \u201ctime is now of the essence.\u201d The buyer emailed back that the change was reasonable and thanked them. On the rescheduled closing date, the buyer was in a car accident on the way to the closing and was hospitalized for a month. When the buyer was released from the hospital, he told the seller and her attorney that he was now ready to close. They responded that the buyer had breached the contract and that there would be no closing. Can the buyer still enforce the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it was the buyer who had requested the change in the closing date.\nB. No, because time was made \u201cof the essence\u201d as to the rescheduled closing date.\nC.

            "explanation": "C is correct. A failure to perform is not a material breach unless time is made \"of the essence\" in the contract. In this case, the contract was amended to extend the closing date and the amendment stated that time is of the essence. However, the buyer's inability to attend the closing was justified due to circumstances beyond his control, and he is still entitled to enforce the contract. Under the UCC, a buyer's obligation to accept delivery of goods is discharged if the seller fails to deliver the goods within the time set forth in the contract, even if the contract states that time is of the essence. The time set forth in the contract was 30 days, and the seller extended that time 15 days. Therefore, the seller delivered the goods more than 30 days after the date of the contract, and the buyer is still entitled to enforce the contract. A is incorrect. It was the seller who proposed the change in the closing date, not the buyer. B is incorrect. Even though time was made of the essence, the buyer's failure to attend the closing was justified due to circumstances beyond his control. Under the UCC, a failure to perform is not a material breach when the non-performing party has reason for the failure and the other party has reason to know that the failure is not a material breach. In this case, the buyer was injured in a car accident, a circumstance beyond his control. Also, the seller knew that the buyer had been injured in a car accident and therefore had reason to know that the buyer's failure to attend the closing was not a material breach. D is incorrect. The fact that the original contract was silent on the issue of time being of the essence does not mean that the seller cannot make time of the essence if the contract is amended. When the contract was amended to extend the closing date, the seller stated that time is of the essence, and therefore that provision now applies."

When the buyer requested a postponement of 15 days, the seller agreed but noted that time was now \u201cof the essence,\u201d which the buyer agreed was reasonable. Time may be made of the essence later if there is a reasonable time between the notice and the new date. Answer A is incorrect. A buyer can request a change in the closing date. If the seller had not agreed, the buyer could close within a reasonable time of the initial closing date because time had not yet been made of the essence. Answer C is incorrect. Time had been made \u201cof the essence\u201d when the closing date was changed. It is irrelevant why the buyer did not appear at the rescheduled closing. Answer D is incorrect.

Seventeen years ago, the city discontinued using the land as a park. Because the city needed additional parking for nearby city buildings, it paved the land and has used it as a parking lot ever since.

In this case, the city established all of the required elements to establish title in itself by adverse possession. The city\u2019s use of the land as a parking lot for 17 years was open and notorious, it was exclusive because it did not share control with anyone else, it was actual, and it lasted for the correct period of time under the statute of limitations.

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park.

The man\u2019s mother granted the bank a mortgage on a motel that she owned, but she did not sign a promissory note. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. Five years later, after real estate values had dropped considerably, the man defaulted on the loan from the bank. After acceleration, the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against both the commercial building and the motel owned by the mother. The mother timely objected to the foreclosure proceedings against the motel. The bank responded that it had the right to include both the commercial building and the motel in the foreclosure proceedings. Who is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because the motel was voluntarily mortgaged to secure the man\u2019s debt.\nB. The bank, because the mother is personally liable on any loan secured by the mortgage on the motel.\nC.

The mother holds a first mortgage on the motel, which is senior to the bank\u2019s mortgage. The bank does not hold an enforceable mortgage on the motel, so answer D is correct.

Although those facts would support the bank\u2019s claim if the mortgages were in the same priority, answer D correctly addresses the priority of the mortgages.

            "explanation": "A is correct. The easement described in the facts is an appurtenant easement. An appurtenant easement will run with the land, meaning when the woman conveyed her land to the buyer, the easement also conveyed to the buyer. If the man attempts to block the easement, the buyer can bring an action for injunction to prevent interference with the easement. B is incorrect. The man's receipt of $10,000 has no relation to the type of easement created in this fact pattern. The facts indicate the woman and the man were the only two with rights to the easement; the woman had a right to use the easement; the man had a duty to allow the woman to use the easement. C is incorrect. The buyer did not purchase the land from the man; she purchased it from the woman. Although the woman had no obligation to reveal the easement to the buyer, the buyer's lack of knowledge does not alter the legal rights of the parties. The easement is appurtenant, and it will run with the land. D is incorrect. An appurtenant easement is one that runs with the land. An easement in gross, on the other hand, is a right to use another's land that does not run with the land. It is a personal right, and it is not transferable. In this case, the easement is appurtenant, and it does run with the land."

The supplier became convinced that the lookout was a police informant. He persuaded the dealer that they should kill the lookout to avoid problems. They purchased a gun and ammunition to commit the murder and planned to dispose of the lookout\u2019s body by pushing it off a cliff. The supplier arranged a meeting in a remote area of a state park. After the three men arrived, the supplier fired two shots at the lookout, who fell to the ground. Both the supplier and the dealer believed that the lookout was dead. The dealer subsequently pushed the lookout\u2019s body off a nearby cliff. Unbeknownst to the supplier and the dealer, the lookout had been wounded by the bullets but was not dead; he died as a result of the fall from the cliff. Can the supplier be convicted of murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the shooting and the disposal of the body were separate events that cannot be viewed as a single scheme or plan.\nB. No, because the supplier did not intend that the fall from the cliff would kill the lookout.\nC.

            "explanation": "B is correct. In some jurisdictions, where there is more than one crime committed during a single scheme or plan, the defendant may only be convicted of one crime. However, in this case, the supplier aided and abetted the dealer in committing murder, and the supplier had the requisite intent to commit murder. The supplier believed that his shots had killed the lookout, and, in fact, would have been guilty of murder had the lookout died from the shooting. The supplier's intent to commit murder was not diminished by the fact that the dealer pushed the body off a cliff. Therefore, although the dealer committed two murders, the supplier, as an aider and abettor, committed only one murder. Thus, A is incorrect. However, in this case, the supplier had the requisite intent to commit murder, which was to kill the lookout. Whether the lookout was actually killed by the shooting or by the fall from the cliff is irrelevant; the supplier intended to kill him, and, in fact, would have been guilty of murder had the lookout died from the shooting. Therefore, B is incorrect. C is incorrect. Although the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of the scheme to kill the lookout, the supplier's intent to commit murder was to kill the lookout, not to cause the lookout to die from a fall from the cliff. Therefore, the dealer's commission of a second murder by pushing the body off the cliff does not make the supplier guilty of two murders. However, the supplier aided and abetted the dealer in committing murder, and the supplier had the requisite intent to commit murder. The supplier believed that his shots had killed the lookout, and, in fact, would have been guilty of murder had the lookout died from the shooting.

In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000.

            "explanation": "B is correct. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of another's property by someone who has lawfully obtained possession of the property. When the woman invested the trust fund's $100,000 in the speculative stock, she lawfully obtained possession of the property but subsequently converted it to her own use when she sold the stock. Her crime is one of embezzlement and is thereby punishable according to the degree of the crime, which in this case is determined by the value of the property embezzled, which was $100,000. A is incorrect because the woman did not embezzle $200,000; she was only entrusted with $100,000 that she converted to her own use. In addition, even if the value of the stock had been determined to be the value embezzled, the woman only sold the stock and converted the proceeds to her own use; she did not embezzle the entire $200,000 proceeds. She could only be convicted of embezzling the amount that she was originally entrusted with, which was $100,000. However, for the purposes of this question, it is as if the statute punishes embezzlement of over or under the actual value of the assets, with the value of the original assets being the determinate factor. In that case, A could be correct because the value of the stock exceeded the value of the original certificate. However, most jurisdictions follow the majority rule, which is that only the amount embezzled and not the amount the property later generated is used to determine the degree of the crime. C is incorrect because when the woman converted the proceeds to her own use, all that she had in her possession was $80,000. However, embezzlement is not completed until the property is converted to one's own use. It was not until the woman sold the stock and put the proceeds from the sale into her own name that she committed embezzlement. It was then that she embezzled $100,000, not $80,000. In addition, even if the value of the stock had been determined to be the value embezzled, the woman only sold the stock and converted the proceeds to her own use. She did not embezzle the entire $200,000 proceeds, and she did not embezzle any amount above the value of the original assets. She could only be convicted of embezzling the amount that she was originally entrusted with, which was $100,000. However, for the purposes of this question, it is as if the statute punishes embezzlement of over or under the actual value of the assets, with the value of the original assets being the determinate factor.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

B is incorrect. An instruction for involuntary manslaughter would be improper in this case. An instruction on involuntary manslaughter would be proper only if the woman had been driving while intoxicated, but not to such an extent that her ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct had been destroyed. The woman's conduct here was grossly negligent enough to amount to depraved heart, but she was not acting with the intent to kill or to cause serious injury, and thus was not committing a felony or driving while intoxicated, and so an instruction for involuntary manslaughter would be improper. In addition, an instruction for involuntary manslaughter would not be the lesser offense available, as there are no lesser homicide offenses between murder and manslaughter (man slaughter is not a statutory offense in this jurisdiction, and even if it were, it would not be a proper lesser offense instruction as it is not a specific statutory offense). C is incorrect. An instruction on manslaughter based on voluntary intoxication would be improper in this case.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

B is incorrect. The value of the stolen computer equipment is an offense element, not a sentencing factor, and will determine the defendant\u2019s crime and maximum sentence if he is found guilty. C is incorrect. Although a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses, the court is not required to do so whether or not the request is made by the defense. C is correct in stating that a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses, but for this question, D is a better response because the question asks for the response upon the defense attorney\u2019s request.

Since solicitation of murder is less serious than conspiracy to commit murder or attempted murder, but more serious than misprision of a felony, it is the highest proper conviction in this case. A is incorrect. The man cannot properly be convicted of attempted murder. To be convicted of attempt, a person must commit some act that constitutes a \"substantial step\" toward the commission of a crime. Here, the man did not commit any act toward the commission of murder. He agreed to pay for the murder and made an arrangement to pay for the murder, but he did not commit a substantial step toward the murder of his ex-wife. He cannot properly be convicted of conspiracy to commit murder for the same reasons. B is incorrect. The man cannot properly be convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. To be convicted of conspiracy, a person must agree with another person to commit a crime with the intent to commit that crime. In this case, there was no agreement between the man and the officer to commit murder with the intent to commit murder. There was only an agreement to commit murder for hire. D is incorrect. The man cannot properly be convicted of misprision of a felony. Misprision of a felony is the knowing concealment of a felony. In this case, the man did not know that the officer was an undercover police officer and thus he could not have knowingly concealed a felony."

Answer A is incorrect because the facts do not show that the man took sufficient steps toward completing a murder.

Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony. Additionally, the facts do not establish a misprision. That offense   occurs when a person fails to inform the authorities about a felony that the person knows about.",

Through a window, the officers saw a man, whose hands were bleeding, shouting and throwing things, but no one else appeared to be present in the home. When the officers knocked on the door, the man refused to respond. The officers then asked if he needed medical assistance. The man told them to leave and not come back unless they had a warrant. The officers then entered the home, and the man pointed a shotgun at them. The officers withdrew but later arrested the man for felony assault on a police officer. Alleging that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment, the man has moved to suppress the officers\u2019 testimony at trial.

A is incorrect. The man did not have the requisite intent to commit a conspiracy offense for armed robbery.

The woman's actions, while they caused the death of the driver, were not an overtly aggressive or intentional act, so she cannot be convicted of voluntary manslaughter. The woman did not commit a misdemeanor in this case because reckless driving cannot be used to prove malice aforethought or the appropriate mental state for manslaughter. Therefore, the most serious homicide charge the woman can be properly convicted of is involuntary manslaughter, which is the legal cause of the death as the result of actions that were grossly negligent. However, the woman can also not be convicted of involuntary manslaughter as it is defined in the question, because reckless driving is not negligent enough to amount to a crime. Therefore, the woman can not be convicted of any form of manslaughter, and answer D is correct. A is incorrect because the woman did not act with malice aforethought, and therefore cannot be convicted of murder. Malice does not include action taken in reckless disregard of human life, and the woman's actions, while they were reckless, were not done with the intent to cause serious harm to the driver.

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC.

The standard of care for capital defense attorneys requires them to conduct a reasonable investigation into the background of their clients to gather mitigating evidence. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 380 (2000). Here, the attorney failed to do so, which constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Because the defendant's post-conviction petition alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, he is not required to show that the mitigating evidence would have been sufficient to overcome the death penalty; rather, there only needs to be a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different had the evidence been presented. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict. See id. Therefore, if the court finds that there is a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury's sentence, it should grant the petition. A is incorrect because the standard of care for capital defense attorneys requires them to conduct a reasonable investigation into the background of their clients to gather mitigating evidence, not to engage in some sort of trial strategy that would neglect this duty. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 380 (2000). B is incorrect because the standard of care for capital defense attorneys requires them to conduct a reasonable investigation into the background of their clients to gather mitigating evidence. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 380 (2000). B is incorrect because the standard of care for capital defense attorneys requires them to conduct a reasonable investigation into the background of their clients to gather mitigating evidence. In addition, the Strickland standard of care does not apply in capital cases; rather, the standard of care is whatever is reasonable under the circumstances. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 399. D is incorrect because the decision of what evidence to present in mitigation does not need to be strategically based. Rather, the decision of what evidence to present must be made after the attorney has conducted a reasonable investigation into the background of the client. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 380 (2000)."

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
