            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The Supreme Court has ruled that when a federal claim and a state law claim are so related that they form part of the same case or controversy, the federal claim must first be resolved. Here, the federal claim and the state law claim share a common nucleus of operative fact, namely how the bank calculated interest in the depositor\u2019s account. B is incorrect. Although the federal claim must first be resolved, there is no jurisdictional bar to the bank arguing that the federal claim must first be resolved. C is incorrect. The bank did not raise a federal defense to the state law claim; rather, it argued that the depositor\u2019s state law claim is preempted by federal law. D is incorrect. The depositor\u2019s federal claim satisfies the federal statute of limitations, and the state law claim is inextricably linked to the federal claim, such that resolution of the federal claim first is required; therefore, the court does have jurisdiction to hear the federal claim.\n",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

The amended complaint asserted the $120,000 state-law claim and a related federal-law claim against both defendants. Twenty-five days after service of the amended complaint, the second defendant removed the action to a federal court in State B with the first defendant\u2019s consent. Was removal proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the first defendant was a citizen of the forum state.\nB. No, because the notice of removal was untimely.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The second defendant should have filed a notice of intent to file a notice of removal within 30 days of when the action became removable. Here, when the second defendant was added to the action, the action became removable because the parties met the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. However, because the second defendant did not file his notice of intent to file a notice of removal within 30 days of when he was added to the action, removal was improper. A is incorrect because the first defendant was not a citizen of the forum state, and thus, the case was removable. However, the second defendant should have filed a notice of intent to file a notice of removal within 30 days of when the action became removable because the parties met the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. C is incorrect because the federal claim must be asserted in the initial complaint to make the case initially removable. If the federal claim is asserted in an amended complaint, the case only becomes removable upon service of the amended complaint. Here, the second defendant should have filed a notice of intent to file a notice of removal within 30 days of when he was served with the amended complaint, which had the federal claim. He did not do so, and therefore, removal was improper. D is incorrect because for the case to be removable, the parties must meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction at the time of removal, not at the time the action was initially filed. When the first defendant was added to the action, the parties did not meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction to make the case removable. It was not until the second defendant was added to the action that the parties met the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, at which time the second defendant failed to file a notice of intent to file a notice of removal within 30 days of when the action became removable.\n",

            "question_number": 14,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. An action is removable if it could have been originally filed in federal court. Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

The defendant travels to State A once each year for a weeklong vacation but has no other State A contacts. The defendant answered, denying all allegations. One week later, the defendant filed an amended answer, denying all allegations and including the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. State A has a long-arm statute that permits personal jurisdiction to the constitutional limit. The defendant has moved for an order dismissing the action based on the personal-jurisdiction challenge asserted in the amended answer. Should the court issue the order?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

No, because the defendant was personally served with process within 100 miles of the federal courthouse where the action is pending.\nC.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h) permits litigants to raise personal-jurisdiction challenges for the first time in an answer that is amended as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1). Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants. Answer D is incorrect. Personal service under Rule 4 can occur at any location, not just the person\u2019s home.

The plaintiff did not file proof of service. Assume that any relevant state service law is the same as federal law. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the plaintiff failed to effect proper service of process.\nB. No, because the plaintiff failed to file proof of service.\nC. Yes, because the defendant should have returned the waiver request within 60 days of service.\nD. Yes, because the plaintiff mailed notice of the complaint as permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d), a request to waive service must be mailed with the complaint. However, to obtain entry of default and a default judgment, a plaintiff must show that service was made under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c). Here, the plaintiff did not file proof of service, so B is incorrect. The waiver request that was mailed with the complaint is not proof of service. To be considered properly served, the defendant had to return the signed waiver request within 21 days of receipt of the request. If it had not done so, the plaintiff could have sought entry of default and a default judgment on that basis. However, the defendant did not receive the signed waiver request until 61 days after it was mailed, so the plaintiff is not entitled to entry of default and a default judgment based on that basis of service. Therefore, A is correct. C is incorrect. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d), if a defendant fails to return the signed waiver request within 21 days of receipt, the plaintiff may serve the defendant in the manner provided for service of a summons and complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c). Here, the defendant did not receive the waiver request for 61 days after it was mailed, so the 21-day period for waiver would not apply even if the defendant had received it in a timely manner. D is incorrect. The notice of the complaint accompanying the waiver request is permitted by Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d), but it does not constitute service of process.

Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect.

Here, the passenger's action involves common questions of fact with similar actions pending in State B federal court. Therefore, the railroad's best argument in support of its motion to transfer is that the actions involve common questions of fact with similar actions pending in the proposed transfer venue. A is incorrect. While the railroad could argue that the accident occurred in State B and many witnesses are located there, the passenger is bringing the action in State A and the railroad is moving to transfer the action to State B.

Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal.

The competitor opposed the motion on the ground that the statutory limitations period had expired. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery has closed, and the competitor will be prejudiced.\nB. No, because the amendment would not relate back and thus would be futile.\nC. Yes, because leave to amend should be freely granted when the underlying action was timely.\nD. Yes, because the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances and relate back to the allegations in the original complaint.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. For purposes of federal statute of limitations, an amendment adding a new defendant relates back to the original filing date when \"the party against whom the claim is asserted... has received such notice of the institution of the action that he cannot reasonably claim undue surprise or prejudice as a result of the amendment.\" FRCP 15(c). Here, the original complaint gave the competitor notice that he might be liable as a witness who made a defamatory statement. The competitor cannot reasonably claim undue surprise or prejudice as a result of being added as a defendant given that he was already a party as a witness. Therefore, the amendment adding the competitor as a defendant relates back to the original filing date, which was before the limitations period expired. A is incorrect because the competitor is not prejudiced by being added as a defendant since he received sufficient notice of the action to avert undue surprise or prejudice. B is incorrect because, as explained above, the amendment will relate back to the original filing date. C is incorrect because the mere fact that the underlying action was timely is not a sufficient basis for granting leave to amend to add a new defendant. To grant leave to amend, there must be \"good cause\" to do so, FRCP 15(a), although this standard is often described as liberal. Here, there is good cause to grant leave to amend because the amendment relates back to the original filing date and, therefore, is timely under the federal statute of limitations.\n",

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Courts may deny leave to amend when the claim to be added is futile. Here, the claim is futile on limitations grounds unless relation back applies. Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.",

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Anyone, including the court on its own motion, may move for a new trial. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 59. Here the best argument the plaintiff can make is that the defendant waived the error by failing to make a motion for a new trial. A motion for a new trial allows a party to argue that the court's instructions were erroneous and, even if error, the error was harmless. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 59. Thus, D is the best choice. A is incorrect for many cases. While it is true that any error in the jury instructions must affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights before it will be a basis for reversal, there are many instances in which the error was not to the defendant's substantial right. For example, if the error was to the plaintiff's substantial right, the error can be a basis for reversal. Additionally, if the error was to a matter that was not a party's substantial right -- as when non-mandatory claims for relief are included in the case -- the error can also be a basis for reversal. B is incorrect for many cases. While it is true that for judgments by juries of 12, a motion for a new trial must be made in a timely manner, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), timely made motions for new trials allow parties to argue error in jury instructions and, even if error, the error was harmless. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 59. Thus, C is incorrect. While it is true that the court has discretion to give or fail to give jury instructions, here the court gave the instructions and the plaintiff's best argument is that the defendant waived the error by failing to object or to make a motion for a new trial.\n",

Because the defendant did not object to any of the instructions, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51(d)(2) provides that the defendant\u2019s appeal can only be successful if the instruction affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, which is the standard for plain error. Answer B is incorrect. There is no obligation to seek a new trial before challenging jury instructions on appeal, so long as the applicable plain error standard can be satisfied. Plain error is the standard because the defendant failed to object at trial. Answer C is incorrect. Plain error, not abuse of discretion, is the standard for reviewing instructions that the parties did not object to, as was the case here. Answer D is incorrect.

No, because the consumer\u2019s attorney did not object before the judge gave the instruction.\nB. No, because the consumer\u2019s attorney did not object when the judge gave the instruction.\nC.

The consumer's attorney waived his objection to the instruction by failing to make a timely objection. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(1)(B). B is incorrect. The consumer's attorney did not waive his objection, because the judge did not in fact rule on the objection. The judge considered the instruction for clarity and simplicity before giving it to the jury, and he ultimately gave the jury the instruction that the manufacturer had proposed. The consumer's attorney did not have reason to know that the judge had made up his mind with respect to the instruction, and so he was not required to object to it in order to preserve his objection.

He failed to do so, and the objection was waived. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(1)(B). C is incorrect. It is unclear what \"plain error\" means in this context, and in any event, there was no error at all. The instruction was neutral, and no ruling on the instruction was ever made that would qualify as error.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), the court is to apply whatever law would be applied by the courts of the state in which the district court is sitting. Answer B is incorrect. In Klaxon, the US Supreme Court ruled that in cases governed by Erie, the court is to apply whatever law would be applied by the courts of the state in which the district court is sitting, not simply forum law. Answer C is incorrect. Under Erie, the fact that the action is in federal court does not create a right to apply federal law, and state substantive law governs. Answer D is incorrect.

The complaint alleged that the fire had been caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the house\u2019s electrical system in accordance with the applicable housing code. The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent. In opposition to that motion, the tenant argues that under federal law, contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defendant who wishes to assert the defense must plead in an answer or other responsive pleading. Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB. Federal law, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control pleading in federal court.\nC. State law, because the application of federal law would be outcome-determinative.\nD.

Rule 8(c)(1) is on point because it specifically provides that contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defending party must assert in its answer to the complaint. The rule is a valid exercise of the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power, because the manner of pleading defenses is an issue that can rationally be classified as procedure and the rule itself regulates the manner and means by which the parties\u2019 rights are enforced. Answer A is incorrect. The question of who has the burden of pleading, in contrast to the burden of proof, in federal actions is a procedural matter within the US Supreme Court\u2019s rulemaking power.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The broker does not need to determine whether his counterclaim is governed by state or federal law in order to determine if he can join it to his federal securities law claim. All federal claims must be asserted in the initial complaint. If a federal claim is asserted, a plaintiff is required to join all claims that the plaintiff has against the defendant as required by the federal rule on joinder. However, in diversity claims (where the lawsuit is based solely on state law and there is diversity of citizenship between the parties), the joinder rules of the state where the court is located govern.B is correct. Here, the investor is suing the broker, and so the broker must assert any counterclaims he has against the investor. However, the broker cannot do so here because there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties. Under Federal Rule 13(g), a counterclaim by a defendant will be permitted only if the counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original claim. Additionally, under Federal Rule 13(g), a defendant is required to join any such counterclaim. However, the court is not required to join the counterclaim and may dismiss the counterclaim if there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties. C is incorrect. Even though the broker's counterclaim is a compulsory counterclaim, the court may still dismiss the broker's counterclaim if there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect.

In a written agreement, the government agreed to pay the contractor an annual fixed fee and to reimburse the contractor for all expenses associated with the work. The agreement provided that the contractor must pay for all materials and expenses from a special bank account into which the government would deposit required payments and reimbursements. The state collected a generally applicable sales tax from the contractor on materials purchased for the work with money from the special bank account. Was the state\u2019s imposition of the sales tax constitutional in this situation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the federal government is immune from any taxes levied by a state.\nB. No, because the tax was paid from an account directly funded with federal money and the entire economic cost of the tax was borne by the federal government.\nC. Yes, because payment of the tax did not unduly interfere with the contractor\u2019s performance of the work and was not an undue burden on a federal function.\nD.

A is incorrect because only the federal government, and not contractors working for it, is immune from state taxation. B is incorrect because the tax need not be imposed on the federal government in order for it to be unconstitutional. B reaches this conclusion, however, based on the test of whether the tax is imposed on the federal government in any way. C is incorrect because it incorrectly applies the test.

The fee for registration is nominal, and the commission has no discretion to deny a permit to a carrier that properly registers and pays the registration fee. Are the state\u2019s requirements constitutional when applied to a wholly interstate carrier?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because neither a carrier\u2019s registration nor its payment of a nominal fee is necessary to facilitate the application of state laws to motor carriers.\nB. No, because the requirements impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC.

To obtain a license, a tutor is required to achieve a passing score on a state-administered exam in the tutor\u2019s area of specialty. On several occasions, an organization representing tutors licensed in the state has successfully lobbied against proposed legislation that would have eased the licensing requirement. An out-of-state tutoring company would like to conduct business in the state, but very few of its tutors are licensed by the state. The company has sued to challenge the law. Is the company likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nB. No, because the law is substantially related to an important state interest.\nC. Yes, because the law serves the special interests of licensed tutors rather than a legitimate government interest.\nD.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The challenge to the sterilization requirement of the law is an equal protection challenge, and in order to make an equal protection argument, there must be a classification that affects the rights of one group of people as opposed to another. In order to prove an equal protection violation, you must show that the classification is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, or that the classification is not substantially related to an important governmental interest (this is the standard for strict scrutiny). However, if you can show that the classification has a disparate impact on a protected class, you need only show that the disparate impact is not substantially related to an important governmental interest. In this case, the classification is based on prior convictions of sex offenses, and that classification has a disparate impact on racial minorities. Therefore, in order to prove an equal protection violation, you must only show that the disparate impact is not substantially related to an important governmental interest. A is incorrect because the sterilization requirement does not implicate a fundamental right, and the standard for review would be intermediate scrutiny, which requires that the classification be substantially related to an important governmental interest.

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory.

The purchase order stated: \u201cIn the event of a breach, the retailer may pursue all remedies available to it under the UCC.\u201d The manufacturer received the purchase order and promptly shipped the laptops to the retailer. The manufacturer sent an acknowledgment form to the retailer four days later. Two days after accepting delivery of the laptops, the retailer received the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment form, which excluded consequential damages. The same day, the retailer discovered that the laptops were defective. If the retailer sues the manufacturer for breach of contract, will the retailer be entitled to pursue a claim for consequential damages?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the retailer and the manufacturer did not enter into a contract.\nB. No, because a contract was created that included the manufacturer\u2019s term excluding consequential damages.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops constituted an acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer.\nD.

In this case, the manufacturer shipped the laptops and later mailed an acknowledgment form that excluded consequential damages.

Under UCC \u00a7 2-206, an offer made by an order of goods may be accepted by the shipment of goods or by a prompt promise to ship. Here, the shipment of the laptops constituted the manufacturer\u2019s acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer and the terms set forth in the offer. Answer A is incorrect. The manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops was a reasonable mode of acceptance and gave rise to a contract. Answer B is incorrect. The retailer\u2019s order constituted an offer, and a contract was formed when the manufacturer shipped the laptops. Therefore, the exclusion of consequential damages in the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment constituted a request to modify that contract. The exclusion would become a term of the parties\u2019 agreement if the retailer assented to it, which did not occur here.   Answer D is incorrect. This response assumes that the parties formed a contract under UCC \u00a7 2-207(3) by their conduct.

The plumber responded, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there tomorrow at three.\u201d The plumber unclogged the drain and gave the homeowner an invoice that reflected the hourly rate for his services as posted on his website. The homeowner refused to pay the full invoice amount, asserting that his hourly rate was higher than that charged by other local plumbers. The homeowner offered to pay him the average of those rates. The plumber demanded payment of the invoiced amount. Which of the following describes the compensation the plumber is entitled to receive from the homeowner?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Compensation based on the reasonable value of the plumber\u2019s services, because in the absence of an agreement on price, a reasonable price will be supplied.\nB. Compensation at the invoiced price, because the hourly rate posted on the plumber\u2019s website supplied the price term for the parties\u2019 agreement.\nC. Compensation necessary to protect the plumber\u2019s reliance interest, because he rendered services based on the homeowner\u2019s implied promise to pay.\nD.

Although the called-for writing need not be a signed writing, the contract between the homeowner and the plumber would qualify as a writing sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute because it was sent to the homeowner by the plumber. The writing consists of the plumber's invoice, which includes the price term necessary to satisfy the statute of frauds. Therefore, the contract is enforceable, and the price term included in the invoice is enforceable unless the homeowner can show that the price is unconscionable. The homeowner has not made such a showing, so the homeowner is bound by the price term and the plumber is entitled to the compensation set forth in the invoice.\n",

On numerous occasions, the wife\u2019s brother had offered to buy the farm from her, but she had always refused. The husband died suddenly in an accident. The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract is mistake, specifically a mistake of fact. The wife believed that she needed the money from the sale of the farm to support her four children. This mistake, however, was one of fact because it related to the state of the property. The fact that the husband had a life insurance policy was a fact about the wife's financial situation that was not her responsibility to know. Furthermore, the mistake was caused by the brother's fraud, which was enough to support a claim for rescission. A is incorrect because the wife did not perform the contract under a threat of force or the like. In fact, she was the one who was coerced into signing the contract by the brother's attorney. C is incorrect because the contract, when signed, was not grossly excessive in relation to the worth of the consideration exchanged. D is incorrect because the wife did not have an unfair advantage over the brother due to a confidential relationship. The brother took advantage of his ability to create a confidential relationship, rather than one being present.\n",

The executive has sent a signed letter to the firm confirming the terms to which the parties have orally agreed while acknowledging that the salary has yet to be set. The firm has not responded to the confirmation letter. Do the parties now have an enforceable contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because an agreement for lifetime employment is subject to the statute of frauds, and the confirmation letter fails to satisfy the statute.\nB. No, because the agreement is too indefinite to be enforced.\nC. Yes, because the agreement is not subject to the statute of frauds, and the parties must negotiate the executive\u2019s salary in good faith.\nD.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC.

The appraiser told the heir that he had no expertise in appraising art and recommended that she hire an art appraiser to value the painting. The heir, doubting that the painting was valuable, declined to follow the appraiser\u2019s advice and decided to sell the painting at a yard sale. She set the price at $100, assuming that this price reflected the painting\u2019s approximate value. A neighbor, who knew nothing about art, purchased the painting from the heir at the asking price. The neighbor and the heir later discovered that the painting was worth over $900,000. Would the heir be likely to prevail in an action to rescind the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the heir bore the risk of any mistake as to the true value of the painting.\nB. No, because the neighbor possessed no specialized knowledge of the true value of the painting.\nC. Yes, because enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable, given its disadvantageous impact on the heir.\nD.

A mistake that relates to a basic assumption of the contract has no effect on the validity of the contract if the parties were mutually mistaken, or if the mistake was caused by the party seeking rescission. In addition, a mistake that relates to a basic assumption of the contract does not allow a party to rescind if the other party to the contract had no reason to know of the mistake. The heir's mistake as to the value of the painting does not allow her to rescind the contract because the appraiser, had he appraised the painting, would have been charged with knowing the value of the painting. Therefore, the appraiser had no reason to know of the heir's mistake. C is incorrect because the contract is not unconscionable. Unconscionability requires that the contract be both grossly unfair and that the party seeking rescission could not reasonably have understood the terms of the contract. The contract may be considered grossly unfair, but the heir could reasonably have understood the terms of the contract, especially since she had been warned that the painting might be valuable. In addition, the contract would have to be both grossly unfair and enforceable in order to be unconscionable. Answer A is incorrect because the heir did not bear the risk of mistake as to a basic assumption of the contract. In order for a party to bear the risk of mistake, the basic assumption of the contract must have been satisfied, but in this case, the contract was simply a contract for the sale of a painting and not for the sale of a painting with a certain value.

The contract stated that in return for $10,000, the engineer was to \u201ccomplete a feasibility study and a master plan, and use best efforts to obtain county approval of the [developer\u2019s planned] project.\u201d The engineer submitted a completed feasibility study and master plan to the developer. Despite the engineer\u2019s best efforts, however, the county did not approve the project. Because of this outcome, the developer refused to pay the engineer for any of the engineer\u2019s services. In a breach of contract action by the engineer against the developer, which party will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The developer, because an express condition to the developer\u2019s performance obligation failed to occur.\nB. The developer, because the engineer breached the contract by failing to obtain the county\u2019s approval of the project.\nC. The engineer, because the developer breached the contract by not paying once the developer\u2019s obligation to pay the engineer became due.\nD. The engineer, because the failure of an express condition to the developer\u2019s obligation to pay the engineer was excused by governmental action.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. An express condition is a specific requirement that must be satisfied before a contractual obligation is triggered. If one party fails to satisfy an express condition, the other party's performance is delayed, not excused. In other words, the party whose obligation is subject to the condition must wait for the condition to be satisfied before they are obligated to perform. If the condition is not satisfied, the obligation does not arise, not that it is discharged. Furthermore, if the condition whose satisfaction is required for his obligation to become due has not occurred because of an act of a third person for which the other party is not responsible, the condition will be considered to have occurred. Because the contract required county approval of the project as a condition to the developer's obligation to pay for the engineer's services, and this approval was not obtained due to governmental action for which the developer is not responsible, the failure of the condition to occur excused the engineer's duty to perform. Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect because although the failure of the condition would excuse the developer's obligation to pay, the engineer's obligation to perform was also subject to the condition. B is incorrect because although the engineer did not obtain approval of the project, his best efforts were required under the contract, not a strict obligation. C is incorrect because the developer's failure to pay was excused by the failure of an express condition to occur, for which the developer was not responsible.\n",

The engineer\u2019s obligation was to \u201cuse best efforts to obtain county approval,\u201d not to obtain county approval, and the engineer performed all obligations as promised.

There is no express condition. Under the rule of constructive conditions of exchange, the performance by one party is an implied condition to performance by the other party. Since the engineer performed all obligations, the developer breached by refusing to perform the developer\u2019s contractual obligation to pay the engineer. Answer B is incorrect. The engineer did not breach the contract, because the engineer had an obligation to \u201cuse best efforts to obtain county approval,\u201d not to obtain county approval. Answer D is incorrect.

The firm\u2019s bid included a subcontractor\u2019s bid to complete the electrical work on the plant for $100,000. The municipality awarded the construction contract to the firm. Later that day, before the firm told the subcontractor of the award, the subcontractor told the firm that it was withdrawing its bid because it had recently undertaken a new project that would absorb all its capacity for the next 18 months. The firm nevertheless accepted the subcontractor\u2019s bid and demanded that it perform the electrical work on the plant, but the subcontractor refused. The firm had to hire another subcontractor to perform the electrical work, at a cost of $115,000. The firm completed the construction of the plant at a profit. Which of the following statements correctly describes the firm\u2019s legal rights, if any, against the first subcontractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The firm is entitled to recover nominal damages only, because it completed the construction at a profit.\nB. The firm is entitled to recover reliance damages, because it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid when it submitted its own bid to the municipality.\nC. The firm is entitled to recover expectation damages, because the first subcontractor\u2019s bid was irrevocable for a reasonable time and the firm timely accepted it.\nD. The firm has no rights against the first subcontractor, because the first subcontractor was free to revoke its bid at any time before the firm accepted that bid.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Bid negotiations do not create enforceable promises. Bids are merely invitations to potential contractors to submit prices for performing specific work in exchange for a contract. As such, bids can be revoked at any time before the bid is accepted. In this case, the subcontractor revoked its bid before the firm accepted it, so the firm has no rights against the subcontractor. A is incorrect because the firm has no recoverable claim against the subcontractor. Because the subcontractor's bid was not an enforceable promise, the firm's reliance on it (even if detrimental) does not give rise to a valid claim. B is incorrect for the same reasons. C is incorrect because bid promotions are not capable of acceptance in the same way that offers in a contract are. Even if the bid were treated as an offer, the subcontractor could still revoke it because there was no consideration to support a promise to keep the bid open.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

The man submitted to a lender a loan application that included a then-accurate statement of his financial condition. The lender reviewed the application and concluded that the man was creditworthy without verifying any of his information. A week after the man submitted his application, however, his financial condition changed significantly for the worse. The man did not report this change to the lender. Two days later, the lender approved the loan, and the man and the lender signed a loan agreement. Before disbursing the loan funds, the lender learned of the change in the man\u2019s financial condition. Is the lender entitled to cancel disbursement of the funds and rescind the loan agreement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the lender failed to independently assess the man\u2019s financial condition before signing the loan agreement.\nB. No, because the man did not affirmatively misrepresent his financial condition at any time.\nC. Yes, because the man concealed the change in his financial condition.\nD.

Therefore, the man's silence does not provide a basis for the lender to avoid the contract. Thus, D is incorrect. Additionally, the lender approved the loan less than a week after the man submitted his original application. The short time frame between the man's original application and the lender's approval of the loan does not suggest that the man's original financial statement induced the lender's approval of the contract. Therefore, A is incorrect. C is incorrect. The man's silence, when he had no duty to speak, is not sufficient to show that he intended to induce the lender's assent to the contract.

Is the owner likely to succeed in a breach of contract action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner acted in bad faith by failing to respond to the buyer\u2019s email.\nB. No, because the owner anticipatorily repudiated her contract with the buyer.\nC. Yes, because the buyer anticipatorily repudiated his contract with the owner.\nD.

When a party to a contract states that he cannot or will not perform, and there is no excuse for the statement, that statement is considered a repudiation of the contract. When a party repudiates a contract, the non-repudiating party is entitled to pursue any remedy available to him, including an action for breach. In this case, when the buyer contacted the owner on March 3 and stated that he might not have the money to pay for the car on March 6, the buyer was repudiating his contract with the owner. Therefore, the owner is entitled to an action for breach, and answer C is correct. A is incorrect because the owner\u2019s failure to respond to the buyer\u2019s email does not indicate that the owner is acting in bad faith, and therefore, the owner can still pursue an action for breach. B is incorrect because the buyer did not state that he would not perform the contract, he only stated that he might not have the money available on March 6 to perform. Therefore, the buyer\u2019s statement on March 3 was not a repudiation of the contract. D is incorrect because the buyer\u2019s failure to accept the owner\u2019s offer to enter into an option agreement has no effect on the buyer\u2019s obligation to perform under the contract.

The motorcycle hit a tire that had fallen off a truck driven by a delivery company employee who was making a delivery to an address on the private road. The boy was injured when his motorcycle went out of control after striking the tire. In a negligence action brought on behalf of the boy against the delivery company, the company contends that the boy was contributorily negligent and that his damages, if any, should be reduced in conformance with the jurisdiction\u2019s comparative negligence statute. The boy argues that his conduct should be judged according to the standard of a reasonable child of like age, intelligence, and experience under the circumstances. Is the boy entitled to be judged according to the standard of care that he has argued for?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the boy was driving a motorcycle.\nB. No, because the boy was trespassing on the private road.\nC. Yes, because comparative negligence applies.\nD. Yes, because the boy was 11 years old at the time.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Contributory negligence is not a valid defense where the plaintiff is a minor. Instead, the minor's conduct will be judged by the standard of a reasonable child of like age, intelligence, and experience. Here, the boy was 11 years old, so his conduct must be judged by the standard of a reasonable child of like age, intelligence, and experience, rather than by that of a reasonable person. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect. The fact that the boy was driving a motorcycle does not, in and of itself, mean that he will be judged by the standard of a reasonable person. B is incorrect. Similarly, the fact that the boy was trespassing does not, in and of itself, mean that he will be judged by the standard of a reasonable person. C is incorrect. Comparative negligence is a defense that may be asserted against an adult plaintiff. It is not applicable, however, where the plaintiff is a minor.\n",

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB. No, because the former employee could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts.\nC.

The established cemetery\u2019s contracts with purchasers were governed by the statute, which limited the circumstances under which the established cemetery could impose a penalty for early cancellation. Thus, the contracts were not at-will contracts in the sense relevant to this question. Instead, they were analogous to fixed-term contracts that could be terminated prior to the expiration of the term so long as the termination was done in accordance with the statute. On these facts, it is unlikely that the former employee interfered improperly with the contracts, because it is unlikely that she intentionally induced the purchasers to cancel their contracts in violation of the contracts or the statute. Instead, it is likely that the former employee competed fairly with the established cemetery for its customers, using a lawful discount to encourage them to switch. Thus, D is incorrect. A and B are incorrect. They do not take into account the effect of the statute on the contracts between the established cemetery and its purchasers.\n",

After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC. Yes, because punitive damages awards are not authorized unless there is proof of willful or wanton misconduct on the defendant\u2019s part.\nD.

Here, the jury found only negligence, and there is no evidence of malice or gross negligence. Therefore, the radiologist was not given adequate notice that he would be subject to punitive damages, and thus the punitive damages award should be vacated. A is incorrect because the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages alone is insufficient to comply with the due process clause. B is incorrect because, although some courts are more willing to allow punitive damages in medical malpractice cases where the plaintiff has been seriously injured or died, such damages are only allowed in this case if the plaintiff can show malice, fraud, or gross negligence.

Even though the intentional pushing of another person without that person\u2019s consent meets the definition of a battery, the privilege to use force (referenced above) would defeat any battery claim brought by the man. Answer B is incorrect. Even though the intentional confinement of another person without that person\u2019s consent meets the definition of false imprisonment, the privilege to use force (referenced above) would defeat this claim. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons stated in the explanations for answers A and B.",

On the day he arrived, just after sunset, he took his bag upstairs to a second-floor bedroom and unpacked. As he was about to head back downstairs, he realized that the stairwell had become too dark to navigate without a light. The man spent about 30 seconds feeling the walls at the top of the stairwell but could not find a light switch. In fact, the switch was located in an awkward position not reachable without descending to the second step. Although he recognized the danger of descending an unfamiliar staircase in darkness, the man started down the stairs. He lost his footing halfway down, fell, and was seriously injured. The man has sued the owner of the beach house for negligence. The jurisdiction recognizes the traditional common law defense of assumption of risk. If the action proceeds to trial, which of the following would be an appropriate (paraphrased) instruction for the court to give to the jury?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling on the darkened stairs, then you must assign a percentage of responsibility to the man.\u201d\nB. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling on the darkened stairs, then you must find for the owner.\u201d\nC. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, but that the man was a mere licensee, then you must find for the owner.\u201d\nD. \u201cIf you conclude that the owner failed to provide reasonably safe premises, then you may in your discretion award the man both compensatory and punitive damages.\u201d\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

The instruction in A appropriately reflects the current modified approach to assumption of risk, which has been adopted by a majority of jurisdictions. Under this approach, the question of the man's assumption of risk becomes one of comparative negligence, with the degree of the man's responsibility for the injury being determined by the jury. B is incorrect. The instruction in B incorrectly states the current modified approach to assumption of risk, which has been adopted by a majority of jurisdictions. Under this approach, the question of the man's assumption of risk becomes one of comparative negligence, with the degree of the man's responsibility for the injury being determined by the jury. C is incorrect. The instruction in C incorrectly states the common law rule regarding duty to a licensee. At common law, a landowner had no duty to make reasonable inspections to protect against hidden dangers to a licensee. However, if the landowner knew of the hidden danger, he had a duty to warn the licensee. Additionally, if the landowner intentionally or by reasonable foreseeability allows a hidden danger to remain on his premises and invites or permits a licensee to enter, he will be found to have assumed the risk of the known danger. Further, under the strict liability standard, if the landowner's condition on his land was extremely dangerous and abnormal, he can be held strictly liable for any resulting damage. Under the facts of this case, because the man was an invited guest, he would be deemed a business visitor and would be entitled to expect reasonable care for his safety. The landowner had a duty to exercise reasonable care to make sure the premises were reasonably safe for the man to use. D is incorrect. In this case, the man is seeking damages pursuant to a negligence claim. Punitive damages are not available in a negligence claim and so may not be awarded by the jury in its discretion.\n",

The debt collector was trying to collect a large debt owed to his client by the woman\u2019s impoverished adult son. Although the debt collector knew that the woman was not legally responsible for the son\u2019s debt, he called the woman multiple times each day and threatened to destroy her credit. He also told her that he knew where she lived and that he was going to withdraw the money from her bank account. As a result, the woman suffered great mental anguish, was unable to sleep, and ultimately suffered serious health consequences. Which of the following conclusions would best support a claim by the woman against the debt collector for intentional infliction of emotional distress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The debt collector could reasonably have foreseen that the calls and threats might cause harm to the woman\u2019s health.\nB.

Thus D is the best conclusion of law to support a claim for IIED. A is incorrect because foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff's health is not a requirement of an IIED case.

A conclusion that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous, combined with the fact that the woman experienced severe emotional distress and the fact that the debt collector was probably at least reckless with respect to the risk of causing her distress, will provide the woman with a plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman\u2019s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.   Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous.

The rocket unexpectedly failed to shoot upward but instead followed a trajectory parallel to the ground and struck the spectator. The spectator has sued the amusement park for damages. On which of the following theories is the spectator most likely to be able to obtain a summary judgment as to liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Abnormally dangerous activity.\nB. Battery.\nC. Nuisance.\nD. Strict products liability.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Battery is the intentional infliction of corporate harm by means of an unconsented, harmful contact. The spectator\u2019s complaint alleges that the amusement park intentionally fired the rockets as part of the fireworks display and that the rockets were defective and dangerous. If the spectator can establish that the rockets were defective and dangerous, and that the amusement park intentionally fired the rockets and caused him harm, then he will be able to obtain a summary judgment as to liability for battery. A is incorrect. Abnormally dangerous activities give rise to strict liability, but only where the activity involves a special danger to the public not common to other activities. Because fireworks displays are common in our society and do not involve a special danger to the public, the amusement park\u2019s organization of the fireworks display does not give rise to strict liability. C is incorrect. The amusement park's organization of the fireworks display does not involve a repeated or a continuous trespasser-like invasion, so nuisance does not apply. D is incorrect. Strict products liability arises from the sale of any product that is in a defective condition or is unreasonably dangerous to person or property. However, the spectator\u2019s complaint alleges that the amusement park intentionally fired the rockets and that the rockets were defective and dangerous. Because the amusement park's actions were intentional, the spectator will not be able to obtain a summary judgment as to liability for strict products liability. Additionally, strict products liability only applies to manufacturers and sellers of defective products, and the amusement park was the organizer of the fireworks display that used the rockets. Therefore, the amusement park is not in the business of selling defective products that give rise to strict products liability.\n",

Answer B is incorrect. The spectator was injured in an accident: the amusement park did not intend to touch the spectator in a harmful or offensive manner, as is required for battery liability.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC. It is not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in places that are visible to neighbors.\nD. Unsightly conditions ordinarily do not of themselves amount to an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of a neighboring property.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. While each of the other choices contain some grain of truth, they do not deal with the issue of what constitutes an unreasonable interference with the homeowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her land. For a nuisance, the damage must be measurable in terms of money. Here, the homeowner\u2019s appraiser determined that the farmer\u2019s use did not decrease the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property. Therefore, the homeowner has not suffered an legally compensable injury, and thus has not suffered an unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her land. A is incorrect because while it is true that the homeowner suffered no legally compensable injury, this is not the best choice. An injury need not be a physical injury; an injury to land is sufficient. B is incorrect for two reasons. First, it is not the best choice because the farmer\u2019s items did interfere unreasonably with the homeowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her land even if that interference was not a trespass. Second, this interference with the homeowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her land was a physical interference with her ability to enjoy her view. C is incorrect for two reasons. First, it is not the best choice because the farmer\u2019s actions were not common in the area and therefore unreasonably interfered with the homeowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her land even if the farmer had not violated a statute. Second, even if the farmer\u2019s actions were common in the area among farmers, this would not be the best argument. The facts do show that it is not common for farmers to keep old equipment in places visible to neighbors.\n",

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

Here, the defendant\u2019s actions in purchasing a plane ticket using an alias while out on bail are relevant to show his consciousness of guilt and, thus, his participation in the conspiracy. Therefore, the evidence should be admissible. A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s actions in purchasing a plane ticket using an alias while out on bail does make a fact of consequence to the trial more probable than it would have been without the evidence. B is incorrect because while the evidence may also show the defendant\u2019s motive to commit the crime, his consciousness of guilt is the more probative factor in this question. In addition, answer B double counts the evidence by saying it is admissible for two independent reasons. While two separate reasons may be sufficient to support admissibility, the reasons must be judged on a case by case basis. Here, the defendant\u2019s purchase of an airplane ticket using an alias while out on bail is relevant to show his consciousness of guilt. When a defendant takes actions that are designed to avoid detection by the police or to conceal his activities, those actions are admissible to show his guilt. D is incorrect because there is no evidence in the question that the airplane ticket was to a country where the defendant would have known he would be ineligible to travel due to the conspiracy charges, and so there is no clear evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive to commit the crime.\n",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

In addition, the testimony is inadmissible because the expert did not consider two recent clinical studies that concluded there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. The expert's testimony is also inadmissible because the testimony is not the product of reliable principles and methods. The expert's opinion also relies on studies that were not conducted on the toxin at issue, but rather on a substance that is similar to the toxin. Finally, the testimony is inadmissible because the expert's opinion is not based on a sufficient foundation. The expert did not consider all of the relevant studies, including the two recent clinical studies that were contrary to her opinion. In addition, the studies that the expert did consider were not conducted on the toxin at issue, but rather on a substance that is similar to the toxin. The expert's testimony is also inadmissible because it would render every opinion by the expert inadmissible in future trials. If the expert is allowed to testify that the toxin caused the plaintiff's respiratory disease based solely on studies about a different substance, then it would be inconsistent for the expert's testimony to be inadmissible in a future case. A is incorrect because there is no landowner/invitee issue of the day in this question. B is incorrect because there is no license/invitee issue raised in the question. C is incorrect because there is no independent contractor/employee issue raised in the question.\n",

The woman\u2019s testimony about the statements in the letter would be offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that those statements were made about her. Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while giving testimony in a proceeding or trial, that is offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. And, as hearsay, the statements do not meet the standards for admissibility under the federal rules. A is incorrect because it confuses federal common law of defamation with evidence law. Defamation is a federal common law issue, while the testimony about the statement is a hearsay issue. B is incorrect because the best evidence rule only applies when a document is being offered for its terms. If the document is being offered for another purpose, such as to show that the document was written about the plaintiff, then no document rule applies. Here the testimony about the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, so the best evidence rule does not apply. The letter itself would be required if it were being offered for a purpose other than the truth of the matter asserted, such as to show that it was written about the woman. D is incorrect because it confuses federal rules of evidence with federal common law of defamation.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, who was standing on a scaffold while painting a building, dropped a paint can that struck the plaintiff on the head while she was walking under the scaffold. At trial, to prove her injury, the plaintiff offers a photograph for admission into evidence. A witness will testify that he took the photograph with his cell phone and that the photograph accurately portrays what he saw. The photograph shows the plaintiff lying on the sidewalk, bleeding from a gash on her head, with a spilled paint can nearby. Is the photograph admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the unfair prejudicial effect of the photograph outweighs its probative value.\nB. No, because there is no testimony establishing that cell-phone technology produces accurate photographs.\nC. Yes, because the photograph will be authenticated by the witness\u2019s testimony.\nD. Yes, because the photograph is self- authenticating.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The photograph, in conjunction with the witness's testimony, provides sufficient authentication to allow the photograph to be admitted into evidence. To be admissible, photographs typically must be authenticated by testimony that provides a basis for believing that the photograph is what its proponent claims it to be. Here, the witness's testimony that he took the photograph and that it accurately portrays what he saw provides a sufficient basis for authentication. In addition, the witness's testimony will satisfy the requirement of a foundation for the admission of the photograph. D is incorrect because, although some photographs are self-authenticating, this is not one of them. A photograph is self-authenticating under the rules of evidence if it is accompanied by a certification, in a form that is generally accepted within the applicable trade or profession, that the photograph is a true and accurate representation of what it depicts. Because there is no certification from a generally accepted trade or profession that the photograph is authentic, it is not self-authenticating. However, the witness's testimony provides sufficient authentication for it to be admitted into evidence. B is incorrect because it states an additional requirement that is not necessary to authenticate a photograph. It is correct that there must be testimony that provides a basis for believing that the photograph is what its proponent claims it to be. However, there is no requirement that this testimony establish that the technology used to create the photograph is accurate. A is incorrect because it suggests that the court can simply weigh the probative value against the unfair prejudicial effect of the photograph and find that the photograph is inadmissible. In order for a photograph to be inadmissible based on the unfair prejudicial effect, the court must find that the photograph's unfair prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value. In addition, a court must consider the photograph in its broader context, including any testimony or other evidence that may be presented to support it. Here, because the photograph, in conjunction with the witness's testimony, provides sufficient authentication to allow the photograph to be admitted into evidence, the court has not yet reached the point where it can find that the unfair prejudicial effect of the photograph substantially outweighs its probative value.\n",

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph \u201cis what the proponent claims it is.\u201d The witness\u2019s proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw it. Proof that cell-phone technology produces accurate photographs is unnecessary, given the witness\u2019s testimony. Answer D is incorrect. The photograph is not self-authenticating; it falls under none of the categories of self- authenticating documents listed in FRE 902.

The prosecutor responded that the defendant had forfeited both his hearsay and his confrontation objections by killing the rival. For purposes of the motion, the parties have agreed that the prosecutor can establish to the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant killed the business rival because the rival had stolen a large amount of money from the defendant.

The defendant has forfeited his confrontation objection but not his hearsay objection.\nB. The defendant has forfeited his hearsay objection but not his confrontation objection.\nC.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying. Here, the defendant\u2019s purpose for his wrongful conduct (killing the declarant) was revenge for a theft and not a desire to prevent trial testimony.

To preserve an issue for appeal, a party must make a timely objection stating the specific ground for objection. In this case, the defense attorney should have made a motion to exclude or strike the evidence, and that motion should have been based on the ground that the evidence is inadmissible. A motion to strike is sufficient to preserve an issue for appeal, but in this case, the motion to strike was not timely because it was made after the witness was excused. In addition, the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses was violated by the admission of the hearsay statement, but that does not, in itself, suffice to preserve the issue for appeal. A is incorrect because, in federal court, an objection is not required; a party need only make a motion to exclude or strike the evidence.

Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103.

Whether the prosecution has made a clear and convincing showing that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be.\nB. Whether there is sufficient evidence to establish a chain of custody of the items.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. For items of evidence to be admitted into evidence, they must be authenticated. For documents, records, and photographs, authentication can be established by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter is what the proponent claims it is. For other items of evidence, authentication can be established by the testimony of a witness with knowledge that the matter is what the proponent claims it is. In this case, the items of evidence are being authenticated by the testimony of the law enforcement officer who found the items in the apartment during a search. The standard for authentication is a preponderance of the evidence, which means that the item is more likely than not to be what the prosecution claims it is. A is incorrect because the standard for authentication is a preponderance of the evidence, not clear and convincing evidence. B is incorrect because, although establishing a chain of custody may be sufficient to authenticate certain types of evidence, it is not the standard used to authenticate all types of evidence. When the evidence is not a document, record, or photograph, authentication can be established by any form of evidence that supports a finding that the matter is what the proponent claims it is to be. C is incorrect because the standard for authentication is a preponderance of the evidence, not a finding that the item is what the prosecution claims it is (which would be the result of the authentication).\n",

The investigator's testimony about the witness's out-of-court statement is inadmissible hearsay if offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that the plaintiff did not fall. However, the testimony is admissible to impeach the witness's trial testimony. When a witness's statement is not hearsay at the time it was made but becomes hearsay when offered in a subsequent action, only the impeachment value of the statement may be used in the subsequent action. Here, the statement was not hearsay when it was made because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that the plaintiff did not fall. It was offered to show that the witness had said one thing previously and said something different at trial, and is therefore admissible to impeach the witness's trial testimony. However, the statement should be given a limited impeachment instruction to the jury to ensure that the statement is not considered for the truth of the matter asserted. A is incorrect because the statement is admissible for impeachment purposes.

Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect.

No, because the lawyer\u2019s testimony would undermine the client\u2019s privilege against self- incrimination.\nC.

Thereafter, the defendant seeks to call the bartender from the nightclub to testify that the eyewitness had consumed a large amount of alcohol before the shooting and that the music in the nightclub at the time of the shooting was extremely loud.

Thus, it is hearsay and not within any exception. Because the statement is hearsay, it is inadmissible. B is incorrect because it is legally irrelevant that the statement is self-serving. C is incorrect because, to be admissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, the defendant's statement must have been made while the matter was fresh in the defendant's mind. In this case, six months had passed between the time the defendant was robbed by his gang members and the time that he told the witness about the robbery. Additionally, the statement must be made so that the statement could be offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that the defendant had been threatened. Because the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it is hearsay and inadmissible. D is incorrect because the prior consistent statement exception to the hearsay rule applies only to testimony of a witness who is testifying about a statement that he made when the matter was fresh in his mind.

There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness.

B is incorrect because hearsay is a statement, not intended to be taken as an assertion, but that is taken as such when made.

She kept one lot for herself, conveyed another to her daughter, and conveyed the remaining lot to her son. Each conveyance was by a deed of gift containing a covenant specifying that only one single-story home could be constructed on the conveyed lot in order to preserve views of a nearby lake from the mother\u2019s lot. The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot. Several years later, the son conveyed his vacant lot to a purchaser using a warranty deed that made no mention of the covenant in the previous deed from the mother. The purchaser promptly recorded her deed. When the purchaser later began constructing a three-story house similar to the mother\u2019s, the mother sued to enjoin the construction. Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, since she herself constructed a three-story house.\nB. No, because there was no consideration given for the covenants in the deeds of gift.\nC. Yes, because the burden of the covenant runs with the land even if the purchaser had no actual notice of the covenant.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The restrictive covenant in the mother's deed to her son will run with the land, binding all subsequent grantees (including the purchaser). The fact that the son's deed to the purchaser did not refer to the covenant is not determinative; what matters is whether the covenant can be reasonably considered to run with the land, which it can. A is incorrect because estoppel cannot be used to overcome a covenant that clearly runs with the land. B is incorrect because the consideration for a covenant running with the land is the covenantees promise to abide by the terms of the covenant, which in turn is supported by the benefitting party's promise to construct his lot in such a way as to make the covenant enforceable. In this case, the covenants in the deeds of gift were consideration for each other. D is incorrect because there is privity of estate, not privity of contract, between the mother and the purchaser.\n",

The burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house), and the benefit was on her retained lot (to preserve her view of the lake). The equitable servitude was in writing and was recorded, providing constructive notice of it; actual notice was not required. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the burden was on the son\u2019s lot (to build only a one-story house) and the benefit was on the mother\u2019s retained lot, the benefit does not limit the mother to building only a one-story house. The mother was permitted to build a three-story house on her lot without being estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser of the son\u2019s lot. Answer B is incorrect. The son did receive his lot by a deed of gift, and no consideration was given. The mother created an equitable servitude, which may be by deed of gift, when she conveyed the third lot to her son, and that deed was recorded, giving constructive notice of the servitude.

The woman and the broker signed a listing agreement, under which the woman agreed that the broker was to be the woman\u2019s sole agent during the six-month period of the listing agreement. The listing agreement was not recorded. The list price for the house was $250,000. The broker produced a prospective buyer who offered to purchase the house for $249,000 and who was prequalified to purchase at that price. The woman rejected the offer, giving no reason for her rejection, and the listing agreement expired the next day. Three months later, the woman sold the house to a corporation for $249,000. The broker never had any contact with the corporation. Is the broker owed a commission?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the listing agreement was not recorded.\nB. No, because the woman sold to a buyer found without the broker\u2019s help and after the expiration of the listing agreement.\nC. Yes, because the broker produced a ready, willing, and able buyer during the term of the listing agreement, and the buyer\u2019s offer matched the ultimate sale price.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Under the contractual theory of real estate commissions, a real estate broker is entitled to a commission (payable by the client on production of an effective agency contract) when the broker has, among other things, obtained a willing and able buyer who is ready to enter into a contract for the purchase of the client's property, and an agency contract between the broker and the client becomes effective. An agency contract will become effective if both parties have agreed to it. The client will not be able to avoid payment of a commission by simply refusing to accept an offer from a party that the broker has introduced to the property. In this case, the broker introduced a willing and able buyer who was ready to enter into a contract for the purchase of the woman's property. The broker had produced a ready, willing, and able buyer during the term of the listing agreement, and the buyer's offer matched the ultimate sale price. Therefore, the broker is entitled to a commission. A is incorrect because, although an recording of the listing agreement might have given notice to potential buyers, it is not required and will not affect the contractual relationship between the broker and the woman. B is incorrect because, although the buyer was found after the expiration of the listing agreement, the broker had produced a ready, willing, and able buyer during the term of the listing agreement, and the buyer's offer matched the ultimate sale price.

The executor of the woman\u2019s estate has asserted that the nephew has no interest in the home. Is the executor correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the nephew recorded the deed before the woman\u2019s death.\nB. No, because the woman\u2019s death did not affect the nephew\u2019s future interest in the home.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The woman and her nephew entered into a valid executory interest agreement. An executory interest is a type of future interest that takes effect after the end of a measured life or after a specified period of time. In this case, the woman and her nephew intended for the nephew to receive the property on the date of his marriage, which would trigger the woman's interest to lapse. Executory interests do not attach until the time specified in the language of the deed has passed. In this case, the nephew's interest does not attach until he gets married. His recording the deed is irrelevant to his rights under the deed. Therefore, at the time of the woman's death, no interest had attached in the property to the nephew, and thus he had no interest to transfer to the executor. A is incorrect because the nephew's recording of the deed had no effect on his rights under the deed. C is incorrect because if the grantor dies before the interest becomes possessory, the interest does not lapse; rather, it simply goes to the grantor's estate. In this case, the woman's death did not trigger the nephew's interest because he had not married. If the woman had not died, and the nephew had married, the interest would have attached to the nephew, not the woman. D is incorrect because the death of the woman did not trigger the nephew's interest. The interest that was created would only attach to the nephew upon his marriage, whether the woman is alive or dead at that time.\n",

Her friend agreed to loan her the entire purchase price if, immediately following the purchase, the woman would deed the land to him. They also agreed that the woman would have 10 years in which to repay the loan and that the friend would deed the land back to the woman when the loan was fully repaid. Lastly, they agreed that during the 10-year period the woman could live on the land. The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her. The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB. No, because the contract between the woman and her friend merged into the deed.\nC. Yes, because the parties agreed that the woman could live on the land.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Although the friends' agreement called the woman's payments a \"loan\" repayment, the facts show that this was merely a label and that the payments were in fact made in the form of possession. An equitable mortgage arises where a seller allows a buyer to take possession of land in exchange for the buyer's promise to repay a loan. An equitable mortgage has the effect of keeping the original title interests in the land the same. In this case, because the woman's \"loan\" was secured by the deed to the friend, the woman had a mortgage and an equitable obligation to repay, and thus was not a tenant. In addition, the friend\u2019s acceptance of the deed and his retention of title for the 10-year term, coupled with the woman's repayment of the full purchase price, established that the woman\u2019s interest in the land was a mortgage and that the friend had kept his title as owner. Therefore, D is correct and B can be eliminated. A is incorrect because the facts show that the transaction was not a lease, but rather an equitable mortgage. C is incorrect because the woman\u2019s possession of the land for a year was not sufficient to establish a leasehold interest.\n",

As a matter of law there is no such presumption. Answer B is incorrect. The merger doctrine relates to contractual promises relating to the quality of transferred title.

Five years later, the woman lost her job, had difficulty making her mortgage payments, and defaulted on several payments. The bank notified the woman that it would accelerate the mortgage debt as permitted by the mortgage. The woman tried to sell the house but could not find a buyer. The woman wants to avoid the publicity of a foreclosure sale and protect her credit rating. The house is not encumbered by any other liens. The woman has asked the bank if it would accept a deed to the house and relieve her from any further liability on the loan. The bank is receptive to the woman\u2019s proposal. Is the woman\u2019s proposal a viable foreclosure substitute under these facts?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because such a transaction would be a clog on the woman\u2019s equitable right of redemption.\nB. No, because this is residential property for which a foreclosure sale is required.\nC. Yes, because the proposal is voluntary and the bank would receive unencumbered title from the woman.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The woman\u2019s proposal would constitute a clog on the future equitable right of redemption, which is available to mortgagors for a certain time after the mortgage debt is accelerated. To be enforceable, a mortgage restriction on transfer must not be a clog on the equitable right of redemption. The bank must have a valid reason for enforcing the restriction, and that reason must arise before the mortgagor exercises its right of redemption. If the restriction is enforced and the mortgagor loses his or her property as a result, any relief the bank receives must be complete and final. In other words, the bank must be guaranteed-for life-not to have to deal with the former mortgagor on the subject property. In exchange for this guarantee, the bank must give something of value, which could be additional mortgage payments. If the mortgagor transfers the property to a new owner, the restriction is considered personal to the mortgagor and is thereby waived. Therefore, a mortgagor may transfer the property even if the mortgage rate or financial terms of the mortgage change. But, as with all things in law, there are exceptions. If the property is being transferred to a new owner as part of a foreclosure substitute (as opposed to a traditional foreclosure sale), the restriction may be enforced in the new owner\u2019s hands. Also, if the mortgagor is attempting to exercise its own right of redemption, the restriction may be enforced if it arises before the mortgagor exercises that right. In those cases, if the restriction is enforced before the right of redemption is exercised, the enforcement of the restriction must be complete and final, as described above. B is incorrect. A foreclosure substitute, whether a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a short sale, is not a traditional foreclosure sale of the type that is governed by statutory requirements. C is incorrect. The bank must have a valid reason for enforcing the restriction, and that reason must arise before the woman exercises her future right of redemption. If the bank accepts the deed without a valid reason for doing so, it will be estopped from enforcing the restriction against the woman when she exercises her right of redemption. D is incorrect. A short sale is a type of foreclosure substitute, but it is not a valid solution in this case. A deed in lieu of foreclosure would be, but the facts state that the woman wants to complete a short sale.\n",

Seventeen years ago, the city discontinued using the land as a park. Because the city needed additional parking for nearby city buildings, it paved the land and has used it as a parking lot ever since. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Last year, the woman died intestate, leaving a son as her only heir.

Here, the city's actions in paving the land and using it as a parking lot for the last 10 years constitutes adverse possession, and the city has given no acknowledgment of the woman's title. B is incorrect because the city's needs are irrelevant to the determination of whether the city has obtained title by adverse possession. C is incorrect because the woman's death has no effect on the running of the statutory period for adverse possession. D is incorrect because after a conveyance, the grantor retains a right to re-enter for condition not yet fulfilled.

Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

The man signed a promissory note, which was secured by a mortgage on the building. Because the man had few other unencumbered assets, the bank required additional security. The man\u2019s mother granted the bank a mortgage on a motel that she owned, but she did not sign a promissory note. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. Five years later, after real estate values had dropped considerably, the man defaulted on the loan from the bank. After acceleration, the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against both the commercial building and the motel owned by the mother. The mother timely objected to the foreclosure proceedings against the motel. The bank responded that it had the right to include both the commercial building and the motel in the foreclosure proceedings. Who is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because the motel was voluntarily mortgaged to secure the man\u2019s debt.\nB. The bank, because the mother is personally liable on any loan secured by the mortgage on the motel.\nC. The mother, because she did not sign a promissory note.\nD. The mother, because the bank does not hold an enforceable mortgage on the motel.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The bank does not hold an enforceable mortgage on the motel. To establish an enforceable mortgage, a lender must obtain a mortgage that is signed by the party owing the debt, as well as a promissory note that the signatory is under an obligation to pay. Here, the mother\u2019s mortgage on the motel was obtained without the support of a promissory note signed by the mother. Therefore, it is unenforceable, and answer D is correct. A mortgage that is not signed by the mortgagor (in this case, the mother as owner of the motel) is unenforceable, and has no effect on the title of the party executing it. Therefore, answer D is correct, and answers A and B are incorrect. While it is true that the mother will be exposed to liability as a result of the foreclosure proceedings, this does not make the mortgage enforceable against the motel. Answer C is incorrect because, even though the mother did not sign the promissory note, she is still exposed to liability related to the mortgage on the motel. However, this does not make the mortgage enforceable against the motel.\n",

The nephew soon discovered that the land was subject to a mortgage held by a local bank, which required monthly payments for the next 10 years. Without telling the niece or seeking her permission, the nephew paid the monthly mortgage payments for one year. The nephew then demanded immediate payment from the niece for half of the mortgage payments he had made. The niece refused. If the nephew sues the niece for contribution, who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of exoneration.\nB. The nephew, because without his payments, the bank could have foreclosed the mortgage and they could have lost the land.\nC.

The doctrine of exoneration allows a mortgagor to deprive his mortgagee of his security by applying the mortgage payments to the purchase of other property. However, in this case, there was no other property to apply the payments to. Additionally, the nephew was never the mortgagor - he was merely the holder of the mortgage, as the result of being granted the land by the mortgagee. B is incorrect. Even though the bank's rights under the mortgage were not affected by the nephew's payments, the niece has no contractual obligation to make payments to the nephew, and he has no right to seek contribution from her. C is incorrect. Even if a partition proceeding were held (in which each tenant in common is required to contribute to the payment of mortgage and tax encumbrances on the subject property), the niece would not be required to contribute because she had not agreed to do so and had not sought to contribute. D is correct. For the niece to be obligated to make payments on the mortgage, she must first agree to do so.

Unbeknownst to the seller, the buyer planned to construct a gas station on the land. The contract provided that the buyer could rescind the contract if the seller failed to deliver marketable title. After a title search, the buyer discovered that a restrictive covenant prohibited using the land for commercial purposes. The buyer had not had actual knowledge of the restrictive covenant before executing the contract. The buyer refused to close on the contract, and the seller has sued for specific performance. Should the seller prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the restrictive covenant rendered the title unmarketable.\nB. No, because the seller was required to deliver perfect title to the buyer.\nC. Yes, because the restrictive covenant did not render the title unmarketable.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, title to the land passed to the buyer at the time the contract was executed. Therefore, the seller had a duty under the contract to deliver marketable title on the closing date. To determine whether the title is marketable, the buyer must conduct a title search to determine if there are any restrictive covenants or other restrictions that would prevent the use of the land. In this case, the title search revealed a restrictive covenant that prohibits commercial use of the land. Although the restriction does not make the title unmarketable, because the buyer planned to construct a gas station, which is a commercial use of the land would (and this is the key to the question)--because the buyer planned to construct a gas station on the land--the buyer is entitled to rescind on the grounds of title failure and is not required to perform his obligation to close under the contract. Therefore, answer C is correct. A is incorrect because although the restriction prevents the use of the land for commercial purposes, it does not render the title unmarketable. B is incorrect because the buyer's (not the seller's) duty to accept marketable title was triggered by the doctrine of equitable conversion, which passed title to the buyer at the time the contract was executed. D is incorrect because the seller did not have actual knowledge of the buyer's plans at the time the contract was executed. The facts show, however, that the buyer had knowledge of the restriction at the time of contract execution and still chose to execute the contract. Therefore, answer C is correct.\n",

To be criminally responsible for the actions of another, there must exist a contractual or pecuniary relationship between the two actors, or the actor must intentionally aid and abet the other in the commission of a crime and have the intent that the crime be committed. Although the dealer contracted with the supplier to kill the lookout and although the supplier intentionally aided the dealer in the commission of murder, the supplier did not have the intent that the dealer would push the lookout off a cliff. Therefore, the supplier cannot be convicted of murder for the dealer's actions. A is incorrect because all of the actions were part of a plan to kill the lookout. However, the plan to kill the lookout was not the supplier's plan; it was the dealer's plan. See People v. Mullen, \u00a042 Cal. App. 4th 7, 49 Cal. Rptr. 2d 23 (1996) (finding that, where two individuals have a joint plan to commit a crime and one commits a crime that is a necessary element of the original plan but that was not part of the other's plan, the other will only be criminally responsible for the crime if the other has the intent that the crime be committed).

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. To attempt to commit a crime, one must have the intent to commit the crime, and one must take a substantial step toward the commission of the crime. The woman intended to receive stolen property, and she took substantial steps toward the commission of the crime by agreeing to purchase the drugs, meeting the agents to pay for the drugs, and arranging to have the drugs delivered to her friend. The fact that the drugs were not actually stolen does not negate the attempt charge; attempts are vertical, meaning that a defendant can be found to have attempted to commit a crime even if the crime is not possible to commit. C is incorrect because it fails to consider that the woman's friend was acting as an agent of the woman when the friend received the drugs from the agents. When the woman arranged to have the drugs delivered to her friend across the street, she was taking a substantial step toward the commission of the crime, and that substantial step would count for attempt purposes even if the woman herself did not receive the drugs. A is incorrect because there was no entrapment. The woman was not induced to commit a crime that she had no previous intent to commit. B is incorrect for the reasons stated above.\n",

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The woman, while driving under the influence of alcohol, struck and killed a pedestrian.

Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another person caused by gross or reckless negligence. The defense attorney should request an instruction on involuntary manslaughter, and the court will honor that request. A is incorrect because there is no evidence that the woman was aware of any unpredictable and dangerous consequence that would cause the death of the pedestrian. Depraved-heart homicide is the killing caused by extreme recklessness. The defense attorney should not request a depraved-heart homicide instruction. C is incorrect.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD. Yes, because the jury could rationally find the defendant not guilty of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser included offense.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. When a defendant is charged with a higher level crime, the court must give an instruction on a lesser included offense if: 1) the lesser offense is necessarily included in the charge (also known as \"facultative\" or \"automatic\" inclusio in some jurisdictions); and 2) the jury could rationally find the defendant not guilty of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser included offense. Here, simple theft is a lesser included offense of aggravated theft, because one of the elements of aggravated theft is that the theft was of property worth $1,000 or more, and that element was not met here (according to the defense expert). Thus, the jury could rationally find the defendant not guilty of the aggravated theft but guilty of the simple theft, so the court must give the instruction. A is incorrect because courts can instruct on lesser included offenses, even if they were not charged by the prosecution. B is incorrect because the value of the equipment was used to determine whether the crime was aggravated or simple, and thus, was an offense element, not a sentencing factor. C is an overstatement of the law and is thus incorrect. While courts must give instructions on all lesser included offenses that meet the test above, there is no constitutional requirement to give instructions on all possible offenses.\n",

To determine whether the man was serious, an undercover officer introduced himself to the man at a bar. The officer said that he had previously taken care of problems for angry spouses. After some discussion in which the man expressed his extreme anger at his ex-wife, the man offered the officer $5,000 to kill her. The officer agreed and made arrangements to meet the man at the bar the next day to collect the $5,000 payment. When the man showed up the next day at the bar, authorities immediately arrested him.

A is incorrect because the man did not attempt to kill his ex-wife; he paid someone to do the work for him. B is incorrect because, although the man and the officer agreed to enter into a conspiracy, a conspiracy requires an agreement by the alleged conspirators to engage in a common mission or plan, and here the man was successful in his endeavor to obtain the services of an officer in the commission of the crime of murder. D is incorrect because misprision of a felony requires that the defendant know that a felony has been committed and that he aid and abet in the commission of the offense.

No, because the warrantless entry was reasonable under the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment.\nC.

The driver died from his injuries. Driving above the speed limit and causing an accident can be charged as reckless driving, a misdemeanor in the jurisdiction. What is the most serious homicide offense, if any, of which the woman can properly be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Murder, based on malice aforethought.\nB. Voluntary manslaughter, based on reckless operation of a vehicle.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter, based on the misdemeanor of reckless driving.\nD. No homicide offense.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The most serious homicide offense that the woman can be properly convicted of is involuntary manslaughter. To be convicted of involuntary manslaughter, a person must have caused the death of another person through gross or reckless negligence. In this case, the woman was driving above the speed limit and lost control of the car, which was gross and reckless enough negligence to support a charge of involuntary manslaughter. A is incorrect because there is no evidence to show that the woman intended to kill or seriously injure the driver, and therefore, she cannot be properly convicted of murder based on malice aforethought. B is incorrect because reckless driving is not a sufficient motive to cause the driver's death and would only support a voluntary manslaughter charge if it was combined with another malignant heart reason. D is incorrect because the woman's actions were gross and reckless enough to support a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. On these facts, a jury could rationally find both that the woman was guilty of reckless driving and that her illegal conduct caused the truck driver\u2019s death. The woman\u2019s conduct constitutes involuntary manslaughter under a theory of \u201cmisdemeanor-manslaughter.\u201d Answer A is incorrect. The woman could be guilty of murder on a theory of malice aforethought only if she intended to kill the driver. But the facts do not remotely suggest that the woman had that intent. The facts also do not support any theory of imputed malice, such as felony murder or depraved indifference. Answer B is incorrect because the woman did not intend to kill the driver and thus cannot be guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Answer D is incorrect because a jury could rationally convict the woman of involuntary manslaughter.",

Under state law, police are required to obtain DNA samples from all persons arrested for felonies and to store those samples in a state registry. The police informed the defendant of the state law and said that they would be using a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample from him. The defendant did not object. The defendant was later acquitted of burglary. A year later, however, authorities matched the defendant\u2019s DNA to an unsolved sexual assault crime. The defendant, now charged with sexual assault, has moved to suppress the DNA sample as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court suppress the DNA sample?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant failed to lodge a timely objection to the sample collection.\nB. No, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nC. No, because the statute violates the Fourth Amendment, but the police acted in good-faith reliance upon it.\nD.

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that states may collect DNA from felony arrestees under their own laws without violating the Fourth Amendment. See Maryland v. King, 569 U.S. 435 (2013). Thus, because collecting a DNA sample from the defendant was authorized under state law, the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated.

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nStrickland v. Washington sets out a two-part test to determine if a defendant's constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel has been breached. First, the defendant must show that counsel made errors that were not strategic. Second, a defendant must show that these errors prejudiced the defense. Therefore, if the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, the defense counsel's failure to investigate would constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\n",
        "ground_truth": {
            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
