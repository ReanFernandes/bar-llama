Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

The law also does not unduly burden interstate commerce, so B is incorrect. The state has a legitimate interest in fostering resource development, and the law is rationally related to that interest. Therefore, the law is constitutional, and D is correct. A and B are incorrect because the law does not effect a taking or unduly burden interstate commerce. C is incorrect because the right to inherit is not a state monopoly that may be withheld or granted only by the state.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

The mayor could choose a higher-cost bidder as long as the action is not a violation of equal protection. There is no equal protection violation in this case, so the selection of a higher-cost bidder would be constitutional as long as there is a rational basis for the selection. B is incorrect. The mayor's action in choosing a different bidder for the project does not infringe upon the owner's First Amendment rights. The owner's rights were violated when the mayor threatened the owner with loss of contract if the owner did not remove political bumper stickers from the owner's vehicle. There is no continued violation of the owner's First Amendment rights in this case. C is incorrect. While it is true that the state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder, the mayor still must select from the bidders in a manner that does not violate equal protection. D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements.

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law. Which of the following is the man\u2019s best argument?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Automobile negligence is not a commercial activity and is therefore beyond the regulatory power of Congress pursuant to the commerce clause.\nB. Congress cannot commandeer a state legislature to enact a law implementing federal policy.\nC. Congress lacks the power to authorize the states to enact such restrictions based on the length of a person\u2019s residence within a state.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nCongress's power to regulate bankruptcy is plenary, and it could provide that the states could establish their own home exemption laws as part of a federal bankruptcy scheme. However, if a state's law providing a judgment debtor with a exemption from execution merely reflects a non-federal policy that Congress cannot enforce, then Congress cannot require the state to change its law. Here, Congress is providing a mechanism for debtors to exempt property from creditors as part of a federal bankruptcy scheme, so Congress has the power to require that the state adopt the specified law as part of that scheme. B is therefore incorrect because Congress can commandeer the state legislature to enact a law implementing federal policy when the policy is part of a plenary federal scheme. A is incorrect because the regulation of bankruptcy does not involve commerce, and is not limited by the commerce clause.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss. While the city\u2019s motion was pending, the city council passed an emergency ordinance requiring both prior notice and property owner consent before the removal or replacement of any electric meter. Should the court grant the city\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the city\u2019s action is capable of repetition yet evading review.\nB.

Moreover, the homeowner cannot show that he is likely to suffer a harm that is redressable in court. The injury to the homeowner was specific to the city\u2019s plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters without prior notice or consent, and he cannot show a real and immediate threat of injury from the ordinance, which provides the safeguards he wanted. A is incorrect.

B is incorrect. The city has unconditionally ceased its allegedly unconstitutional conduct, and the case is moot. D is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest.

An easement is a permanent physical invasion of private property, and thus the state must compensate the owner for that invasion. Because there is no just compensation here, the law likely violates the taking clause. Thus A and D are incorrect. C is incorrect. The fee allowed to be charged here must be related to the costs incurred by the owner as a result of this easement. Any excess would constitute a gift of public funds in violation of the established law of the state, and thus would not constitute just compensation.

Should the court uphold the ordinance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the ordinance burdens political speech and is not necessary to further a compelling government interest.\nB. No, because the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum.\nC. Yes, because the ordinance is narrowly tailored to further the substantial government interest in the city\u2019s appearance.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The city's ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech, so it is subject to the test established in Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (2000). That test requires the city to prove that the ordinance is narrowly tailored to further a substantial government interest. Here, the government interest is in the city's appearance. Although the city has a substantial interest in its appearance, this ordinance is not narrowly tailored to further that interest. Therefore, the ordinance is not valid, so A is correct. B is incorrect. The roadways are not a traditional public forum because they are not \"places...which by long tradition, or by the establishment of government as its forum for communication of information...[have] an implicit public commitment to encourage...informal public communications.\" Gray v.

The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny.

Although the ordinance does amount to a prior restraint on speech, that is not the best argument against its constitutionality. A prior restraint is subject to strict scrutiny, and it is very difficult to meet that standard. But in this case, the city is not regulating speech in a public forum, so strict scrutiny is not the appropriate standard. B is incorrect. Although the ordinance is overly broad, that is not the best argument against its constitutionality. The city could possibly justify a content-neutral ordinance that is overly broad as long as the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.

Her lawyer advised her to plead guilty, citing overwhelming evidence that included a video recording of her confession and multiple witnesses. The woman repeatedly asked whether a guilty plea might lead to her deportation because she had come to the United States as a child and had lawful permanent resident status but not citizenship. The lawyer assured the woman that the charge would not result in deportation and emphasized the unusually favorable terms of the plea bargain. The woman accepted the plea offer. At the end of the woman\u2019s short prison term, immigration authorities informed her that the conviction required her deportation. The woman filed a motion to vacate the plea, citing ineffective assistance of counsel. How is the court likely to rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Counsel was ineffective, and under the circumstances, the woman suffered prejudice even though there was only a remote chance of success at trial.\nB. Counsel was ineffective, but the woman suffered no prejudice because she admitted guilt when tendering the plea.\nC.

Therefore, unless the woman can show that her deportation was the probable result of counseling that fell below reasonable standards, she will not prevail in her ineffective assistance of counsel claim. A is the only answer that takes into account the required prejudice analysis. B is incorrect. The prejudice analysis requires a court to assess whether counsel's ineffective performance actually harmed the woman. Therefore, the fact that the woman has admitted to guilt is not dispositive. Rather, the woman must show that there was a probable result different than that which occurred (in this case, that she would not be deported) had she received effective assistance of counsel. C is incorrect. Strategic choices made after less than thorough investigation are not automatically ineffective; the decision not to investigate further in this case is strategic given the overwhelming evidence of the woman's guilt. However, the suppression of a potentially exculpatory fact (here, the fact that the woman's deportation would be mandated by the conviction) is ineffectiveness. D is incorrect. The woman's likely claim is that her attorney's assurance that she would not be deported was an ineffective promise that induced her to plead guilty.

Upon arriving at the apartment, officers noticed the smell of burning marijuana (which is an illegal substance in the jurisdiction) coming from inside the closed front door. They knocked on the door and announced, \u201cPolice!\u201d Immediately, they began to hear sounds of items being moved inside. Concerned that evidence was being destroyed, the officers opened the unlocked door and entered the apartment, where they saw drugs and cash on the dining room table. They arrested the woman for drug offenses. The woman has moved to suppress the evidence obtained from her apartment, arguing that the police violated the Fourth Amendment when they entered the apartment without a warrant. Should the court grant the woman\u2019s motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the police had probable cause and exigent circumstances.\nB.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. Police officers may forcibly enter a residence without a warrant if there is probable cause to believe a crime has occurred there and there is an exigent circumstance, such as the possibility of destruction of evidence, present. Here, the women was suspected of selling drugs from her apartment, and the officers could smell burning marijuana in the apartment. These facts demonstrated probable cause for the commission of a crime. Additionally, the officers heard items being moved about in the apartment and heard the woman open a closet, creating the exigent circumstance of the possible destruction of evidence. Therefore, the officers' forced entry into the apartment was constitutionally valid, and the woman's motion to suppress should be denied. B is incorrect. Police officers may conduct a warrantless search if there is reasonable suspicion to believe a crime has occurred and there is an exigent circumstance, such as the possibility of destruction of evidence, present. However, in this case, the officers had probable cause to believe that drugs were being sold from the woman's apartment and that evidence would be destroyed if they did not act quickly. Their entry was therefore justified under the exigent circumstances exception rather than the plain view exception. C is incorrect. It is true that police officers may not forcibly enter a residence without a warrant, regardless of whether there is probable cause that a crime has occurred there. However, there is an exception to that general rule: if there is probable cause that a crime has occurred in the residence and there is an exigent circumstance, such as the possibility of destruction of evidence, present, then police officers may forcibly enter the residence without a warrant. D is incorrect. The police officers' actions in announcing themselves and listening at the door were legitimate and did not themselves create any exigent circumstances. The exigent circumstances in this case consisted of the sounds the officers heard inside the residence after they announced themselves, which led them to believe that evidence would be destroyed if they did not act quickly.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. In Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency. Here, the police lawfully knocked and announced their presence at the door. That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the police conduct\u2014knocking and announcing their presence\u2014was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.",

The shot missed the neighbor but struck and killed a police officer at the fairgrounds. The jurisdiction defines murder as at common law but creates three degrees of murder: (a) Capital murder, punishable by death, is the intentional murder of a police officer. (b) First-degree murder, punishable by life in prison, is premeditated and deliberate murder. (c) Second-degree murder, punishable by up to 40 years in prison, is all other murders.

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v.

Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

They connected the incidents because the vandal left specific graffiti at each site, and investigation provided the police with a reasonable suspicion that the perpetrator was a specific local resident. Using an online directory that the resident had joined, the police obtained the resident\u2019s cell- phone number. The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB. No, because the subpoena was based on a cell- phone number that the resident had voluntarily placed in the public domain.\nC. Yes, because a subpoena must be based on probable cause.\nD. Yes, because a warrant is required to collect such extensive historical cell-phone site- location data.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The cell-phone site-location data constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment, and a warrant probably was required for its collection. A warrant must be supported by probable cause and particularly describe what is to be seized. Here, the police likely did not have probable cause to believe the resident was engaging in vandalism, let alone the specific items of evidence they obtained (a year's worth of historical cell-site location data). Moreover, the warrant probably should have particularly described the cell-site location data, rather than just authorizing the seizure of \"any data\" the provider had relating to the resident's cell phone. A is incorrect because, while it is true that a person may have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, that is inapplicable here because the police obtained the information from the provider rather than obtaining it directly from the resident. B is incorrect for the same reasons. In any event, merely placing information into the public domain does not mean that the police can use that information in a way that would violate the Fourth Amendment. There is some debate about whether a police subpoena is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, but for now, it is safer to say that a warrant is required.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

The woman may be tried in separate trials for both murder and attempted murder and, if convicted, can be punished for both.\nB. The woman may be tried, convicted, and punished for both murder and attempted murder, but only if the two charges are tried together.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The woman can't be punished for both attempted murder and murder because attempted murder cannot be used as a lesser included offense of murder, and it cannot be used as a separate offense for which the woman can be convicted and punished, in a single case, because it violates the double jeopardy clause. However, she can be tried for both, and if convicted, she can be punished for both in separate trials. B is incorrect. The woman can be tried for both murder and attempted murder in a single trial, and if convicted, she can be punished for both, but only if the two charges are tried together, because attempting to murder the husband is not a lesser included offense of murdering the son, and it does not violate double jeopardy not to treat it as such. However, she cannot be punished for both in separate trials. C is correct. The woman can be tried for both murder and attempted murder, convicted of both, and punished for both, so long as the sentences run concurrently, because attempting to murder the husband is not a lesser included offense of murdering the son, and it does not violate double jeopardy to convict and punish for both, so long as the sentences run concurrently.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

In the course of the robbery, the first man shot and killed a teller. The police arrived and arrested both men as they were leaving the bank. The men were charged with felony murder and tried separately. The first man (the actual shooter) was tried and convicted, but the jury refused to sentence him to death, so he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The second man was also tried and convicted. The prosecution agreed, based on medical records, that he was intellectually disabled with an IQ of only 60. The jury nonetheless sentenced the second man to death. Is the second man\u2019s death sentence constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is constitutionally disproportionate in light of the lesser sentence imposed on the actual shooter.\nB. No, because of the second man\u2019s intellectual disability.\nC. No, because the second man was not the actual shooter.\nD. Yes.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The Constitution prohibits the execution of individuals who are intellectually disabled. In 2002, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Atkins v. Virginia that the execution of individuals who are mentally disabled is unconstitutional and that the question of whether a particular defendant has a mental disability is an issue that is sent to the jury, with the prosecution bearing the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is not mentally disabled. Therefore, the second man\u2019s death sentence is unconstitutional, and answer B is correct. A is incorrect because the sentences here are not constitutionally disproportionate. The Constitution does not require equal sentences for equal crimes or for equal offenders; rather, the focus is on whether a sentence is disproportionate to the crime committed. Here, both men committed the same crime, and the man who committed the actual shooting was given a longer sentence to life without the possibility of the death penalty, rather than the death penalty. That sentence is not constitutionally disproportionate. C is incorrect because the man who was not the actual shooter may still be executed for his role in the commission of the murder, as long as he is not mentally disabled. C is also incorrect because the theory behind felony murder is that the defendant, by participating in the underlying felony, exposed himself to the risk of becoming liable for murder, even if he did not commit the actual murder. The defendant in this question was participating in the commission of a bank robbery, the underlying felony in this case, and he is responsible for the murder, even if he did not actually shoot the teller. D is incorrect because there are no other reasons that the sentence would be unconstitutional.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

Three witnesses testified for the state that the defendant approached the victim in a bar, engaged in a brief conversation with him, and then, without warning, drew a gun and shot the victim in the stomach. One witness for the state testified that just before the defendant drew his gun and shot the victim, the victim twice kicked the defendant in the groin. The state\u2019s evidence clearly established that the victim died as a result of the gunshot wound. The defendant did not testify or offer any evidence. The defendant requested that the jury be instructed on voluntary manslaughter based upon heat of passion from adequate provocation. The state argued that murder should be the only form of homicide submitted. Should the court instruct on voluntary manslaughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant did not meet his burden of producing evidence of heat of passion from adequate provocation.\nB. No, because the weight of the evidence indicated that the victim did nothing amounting to adequate provocation.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Even though there is not sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the defendant committed voluntary manslaughter, there is enough for the judge to be required to give the instruction. The defendant's theory for the instruction is that the victim's two kicks in the groin constituted adequate provocation that caused the defendant to kill the victim in the heat of passion. The court is required to give an instruction on a defendant's theory of the case if there is enough evidence to support the theory. Therefore, the court must give an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. A is incorrect because the defendant does not bear the burden of producing evidence to support his theory. The requirement is only that there be enough evidence to support the giving of the instruction. B is incorrect because the court must give the instruction as long as there is some evidence to support a jury finding of adequate provocation. The weight of the evidence is irrelevant to the determination of whether the instruction is required. C is incorrect because if there weren't enough evidence to support a jury finding of adequate provocation, then the instruction on voluntary manslaughter would violate the state's burden of proof.

Though this testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, the defense attorney raised no objection. The jury ultimately convicted the defendant. The defendant has now hired new counsel for his appeal and argues that the admission of the federal agent\u2019s testimony was erroneous. If the appeals court finds that the trial court should not have admitted the testimony, does it have the authority to reverse a conviction when the trial attorney raised no objection to the challenged testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The rule that failure to object to an error waives the right to appeal that issue on a motion for a new trial does not apply to plain error. Plain error is a basis for reversal that is assigned for the first time on appeal, even by the defendant. A plain error is an error so obvious and substantial that it affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. If the appeals court finds that the trial court committed plain error by admitting the testimony, it may reverse the conviction even if the trial attorney raised no objection to the challenged testimony. A is incorrect because failure to object to an error does not automatically waive a defendant\u2019s right to appeal that issue on the grounds of plain error. B is incorrect because ineffective assistance of counsel is not the only basis for allowing an appeal when the trial attorney raised no objection to the challenged testimony. When an attorney provides ineffective assistance, it is a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. But a failure to object, in order to be ineffective, must amount to conduct that falls below the ordinary standards of performance. Additionally, with respect to matters of strategy, courts are very deferential to the decisions of the trial attorney.

The friend has established these elements in this case, and his failure to check the mileage himself does not defeat his cause of action for fraud. B is incorrect because the woman's lack of knowledge of the car's actual mileage does not defeat the friend's cause of action for fraud. In order to establish a claim for fraud, the friend must show that the woman made a misrepresentation of material fact, that the statement was intended to induce the friend to enter into the contract, and that the friend relied on the misrepresentation. The woman's lack of knowledge of the car's actual mileage does not negate the fact that the friend has established these elements in this case. D is incorrect because the car's odometer reading did not constitute an express warranty. A statement of fact made by a seller will not be considered an express warranty if the seller indicates that the statement is not a commitment by the seller. In addition, a statement of fact will not be considered an express warranty if it is not made during a negotiation for the sale of the goods. In this case, the woman did not represent to the friend that the car's mileage was 25,000 when he bought it from her; the odometer reading indicated that, and the woman had no duty to disclose additional information to the friend about the car's mileage. Therefore, the car's odometer reading did not constitute an express warranty.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

The common law rule for construing contracts is to look to the language the parties have chosen to express their agreement, and if the language is ambiguous, to look beyond the language to determine the parties' intent. Courts will not, however, supplement a missing term in a contract by imposing what the court deems a reasonable term. Such a rule would make contracts too easy to challenge and would undermine the certainty that is basic to contract law. Instead, courts will either (1) enforce the contract under the terms that the parties have agreed upon, even if those terms are less than ideal for one or more of the parties, or (2) cancel the contract if it is clear that the contract is too ambiguous to enforce. A is incorrect because the court is not required to rescind a contract merely because a dispute has arisen that the contract did not address. B and C are incorrect because courts will not consider who drafted the contract or who would benefit from the addition of a particular term.

Thereafter, the market price of lumber increased significantly. Due to this price increase, on June 14 the seller told the buyer that it would not deliver the lumber unless the buyer agreed to a purchase price of $14,500 and agreed to waive any claim for damages against the seller. The buyer refused and told the seller that she would purchase lumber elsewhere. On June 18, after a reasonable search for alternative sources, the buyer purchased lumber from another supplier for $15,500. If the buyer sues the seller for breach, will the buyer be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, and the buyer will recover damages of $3,000, because that is the difference between the cost of cover and the contract price.\nB. Yes, but the buyer\u2019s damages will be limited to $2,000, because she could have obtained the lumber from the seller for $14,500.\nC. No, because the seller\u2019s request for a price increase was made in good faith and as a result of market forces.\nD.

The seller repudiated her obligation to deliver the lumber by making a defective condition excusal impossible and by demanding an excessive price for the lumber. The buyer properly rejected the proposal and obtained cover by obtaining lumber of identical quality from a substitute supplier. The buyer is entitled to recover the difference between the contract price and the cost of cover, which is $3,000. B is incorrect. The buyer obtained cover by obtaining lumber from a substitute supplier, and the buyer\u2019s damages will be limited to the difference between the contract price and the cost of cover. C is incorrect. The seller's request for a price increase was neither made in good faith nor was it the result of market forces, but rather it was done in anticipation of the market increase to the seller's benefit.

The homeowner found another contractor to complete the second bathroom for $35,000 and has suffered no losses as a result of the builder\u2019s breach. The builder has sued the homeowner for the $30,000 contract price of the first bathroom, which remains unpaid. What is the most likely result of the builder\u2019s suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The builder will recover in restitution the amount by which the bathroom increased the value of the homeowner\u2019s house, not to exceed $30,000.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The rules regarding breach of contract vary from state to state. Under the UCC, which governs contractors, a partial breach of contract gives the nonbreaching party the right to either sue for the partial breach or to treat the breach as a total failure of consideration and sue for restitution. In this case, the builder has not \"breached\" in the moral sense; he has simply refused to perform under the contract. The homeowner, however, is entitled to damages for the builder's failure to perform. Because the contractor-breach has not damaged the homeowner, he is entitled to recover in restitution the amount by which the bathroom increased the value of his house. A is incorrect because the builder has not materially breached the contract and therefore is not excused from performing under it. B is incorrect because the builder has not breached the contract at all, so the homeowner is not entitled to damages. Furthermore, the builder is entitled to payment for his work under the contract, which cannot be avoided even if the other party declines to perform. C is incorrect because it is debatable whether the bathroom has increased the value of the homeowner\u2019s house by more than $30,000.\nThe contract is divisible. The builder has not breached the contract in any way; he has simply refused to perform. The homeowner is therefore not entitled to damages and has no basis to refuse to pay for the work that was completed.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

The owner of the fishing company honestly understood \u201csummer season\u201d to mean June 15 to September 15.

The parties have now discovered that they attach different meanings to the term \u201csummer season.\u201d How would a court likely resolve the different meanings attached to the term by the parties?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Because both parties were acting in good faith, they will be excused from performing under the contract.\nB. Because the fishing company drafted the contract, the meaning of the term \u201csummer season\u201d will be construed against it, and the cannery\u2019s meaning will be used.\nC.

Therefore, the fishing company will bear the risk of ambiguity in using the term \"summer season\" in its contract with the cannery, and the cannery's meaning will control. A is incorrect. Even if both parties were acting in bad faith, they would still be required to perform the contract in accordance with the principles of contract law (although they could sue each other for damages caused by the other party's conduct). C is incorrect. Only the party whose meaning was incorporated into the contract through trade usage would be bound by that usage. In this case, the cannery accepts the meaning of \"summer season\" as incorporated into the contract, and is instead arguing that the court should apply the trade usage to determine the meaning of the term.

At trial, the plaintiff planned to call several bar patrons who had been present on the night in question to testify to the circumstances of the alleged assault. The trial judge ordered all witnesses excluded from the courtroom during the trial except for the parties. The trial judge then ordered the plaintiff to testify first during his case- in-chief and to relate his version of events before hearing the testimony of other eyewitnesses. The plaintiff has objected to the order requiring him to testify first. Did the trial judge exceed her authority in ordering the plaintiff to testify first?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the trial judge has broad discretion to exercise control over the order of examining witnesses.\nB. No, because the trial judge must determine the order in which evidence is presented at trial.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The trial judge here violated the order of examination rule, which provides that when a party calls multiple witnesses to testify to the same fact, the party against whom the fact is offered has the right to examine the witnesses in the order designating them. The reason for the rule is to allow parties to determine the weight and credibility of evidence by hearing the testimony of witnesses in the order designated by the opposing party. Here, the plaintiff called multiple eyewitnesses to testify to the same fact -- the circumstances of the assault. The defendant was entitled to examine these witnesses in the order that the plaintiff designated to them, and the trial judge here violated that right by requiring the plaintiff to testify first. A is incorrect because the trial judge's decision here was not a discretionary decision about the order of witnesses -- it was a requirement that the plaintiff testify first. B is incorrect for the same reason. While it is true that the trial judge must determine the order in which evidence is presented, the trial judge here abused her discretion by requiring the plaintiff to testify first. C is incorrect because a party does not have the right to control the presentation of proof during its case-in-chief as to the order in which witnesses are examined.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation.

One year later, a fire completely destroyed the woman\u2019s house and its contents, and she learned that the policy covered the cost of rebuilding the house but not the cost of replacing the contents. The woman sued the insurance company for breach of contract, claiming that when the agent sold her the policy, he did not notify her, as was legally required, that she would have to purchase a supplemental policy to cover the house\u2019s contents. At trial, the woman testified that the agent had not provided the required notice.

Therefore, the supervisor\u2019s testimony is admissible. A is incorrect. This answer suggests that an eyewitness\u2019s denial that a routine practice was followed creates an issue of fact that cannot be decided by admitting evidence of the routine practice. However, the routine practice evidence is not inadmissible simply because there is an issue of fact about whether the practice was followed in a particular instance.

The court denied the motion. When the child entered the courtroom to testify, the defendant became unruly, moving as though he was about to lunge from his chair toward the child. The judge warned the defendant to stop the behavior. After a second warning, the judge told the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to behave inappropriately.

At trial, the prosecutor presents evidence that, two days before the fire, the defendant paid $10,000 to a man who was later seen entering the restaurant shortly before the fire started. The man has invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refuses to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial. The prosecutor calls the man\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who testifies that on the day of the fire, she noticed that the man seemed nervous and asked him what was wrong. She says that he told her, \u201cI\u2019m getting paid $10,000 to burn down a restaurant tonight, and I\u2019m a little nervous about it.\u201d The defendant objects to the admission of the man\u2019s statement to the fianc\u00e9e, relying on the hearsay rule and the confrontation clause. Is the man\u2019s statement to the fianc\u00e9e admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the man\u2019s statement is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the man\u2019s statement is testimonial, so admitting it would violate the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.\nC. Yes, because the man\u2019s statement is a nontestimonial declaration against penal interest.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The man's statement to the fianc\u00e9e is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, namely, that the man had agreed to burn down the restaurant and was nervous about it. As such, it is hearsay, and it does not fall within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. However, C is a better answer because it gets to the heart of the issue, which is that the man's statement is not hearsay at all. Under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against the person who made it and is \"so far contrary to the person\u2019s position that, in order to be fairly considered, it must be taken as against the person.\" Because the man is unavailable to testify, his statement is being offered against the defendant, who had hired the man to burn down the restaurant. Furthermore, the man's statement is so contrary to the man's position that it must be taken as against him. Therefore, the man's statement is admissible, and A is incorrect. B is incorrect. The man's statement is not testimonial. When the fianc\u00e9e asked the man what was wrong, the man was not giving testimony like in a criminal investigation or prosecution. Rather, he was making a casual comment to his fianc\u00e9e about his nervousness. Therefore, the man's statement does not violate the defendant's right of confrontation under the Fifth Amendment. D is incorrect. The man's statement to the fianc\u00e9e is not a statement by a coconspirator. In addition, even if it were, it would not be admissible, because it is hearsay. However, C is a better answer because it gets to the heart of the issue, which is that the man's statement is not hearsay at all. Under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against the person who made it and is \"so far contrary to the person\u2019s position that, in order to be fairly considered, it must be taken as against the person.\" Because the man is unavailable to testify, his statement is being offered against the defendant, who had hired the man to burn down the restaurant.

The complaint alleged breach of contract claims arising from construction delays and deficient electrical work that had caused the corporation significant financial losses. The general contractor filed a crossclaim against the subcontractor, asserting only the defense that the general contractor was not liable to the corporation because the subcontractor\u2019s deficient work was the sole cause of the construction delays and the corporation\u2019s losses. After discovery, the corporation settled with the general contractor and dismissed the claims against it. The subcontractor has moved to dismiss the general contractor\u2019s crossclaim. Which of the following arguments best supports the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The crossclaim is improper, because it asserts a defense, not a claim for relief.\nB. The crossclaim is improper, because the general contractor and the subcontractor are opposing parties, not co-parties.\nC. The crossclaim is invalid, because the general contractor is no longer a party to the underlying action.\nD. The crossclaim is premature, because it is contingent on a finding that the defendants breached the construction contract.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. Under Federal Rule 13(g), a cross claim is permitted when a co-party joins in an original action to assert a claim or counterclaim for relief. Under Federal Rule 13(b), however, a party may assert by way of a defense any claim that the party has against a co-party. Here, the general contractor is asserting only a sole cause of action in defense, and not a claim for relief, and so it may not assert this as a cross claim. B is incorrect. For cross claim purposes, co-parties are defined as parties who join in an original action, not as parties who may be involved in the same case but who are not original co-plaintiffs. Here, the general contractor and the subcontractor are opposing parties, not co-parties. However, it is worth noting that the general contractor and the subcontractor did become co-parties once the general contractor was named in the complaint. As co-parties, the general contractor and the subcontractor would have been permitted to assert cross claims against one another. However, the general contractor failed to do so, instead asserting a sole defense against the subcontractor. C is incorrect. The general contractor\u2019s status as a party to the underlying action was not wiped away by the settlement. Although the corporation discharged its claims against the general contractor in the settlement, the general contractor remains a defendant in the action, and thus, it remains a co-party to the subcontractor. D is incorrect. It is true that the success of the general contractor\u2019s cross claim is contingent upon the court finding that the general contractor has a valid defense to the corporation\u2019s cross claim. However, this contingency does not arise from the cross claim itself being premature. Rather, it is a feature of the nature of the general contractor\u2019s claim.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(g) allows parties to bring claims against co- parties. There is no authority under Rule 13(g) to allow an attempt to assert a defense against the plaintiff so as to shift direct liability for damages owed to the plaintiff to a codefendant. Answer B is incorrect. The general contractor and the subcontractor were both joined by the corporation as defendants.      That makes them codefendants under Rule 13(g). Answer C is incorrect. Even if the corporation\u2019s claim against the general contractor has been dismissed, as long as the crossclaim remains undetermined, the general contractor and the subcontractor remain in the suit for purposes of that claim. Answer D is incorrect. Rule 13(g) specifically provides that a crossclaim may include a claim that the co-party is or \u201cmay be\u201d liable for all or part of the claim asserted in the main action. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure often allow for the assertion of contingent claims to avoid multiple lawsuits and encourage resolution of the entire controversy among the parties with a minimum of procedural steps.",

The order set a jury- selection and trial date for two months after the motions deadline. After the motions deadline expired, and a month before jury selection and trial, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney moved for a six-month extension of the discovery, motions, and jury-trial deadlines. The attorney explained that she had been so busy that she had been unable to depose key witnesses or discuss settlement options with her client. The defendant objected to the extension on the ground that there had been ample time to prepare and that the delay would result in increased costs. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the attorney has not shown good cause for the delay.\nB. No, because the court has set the date for jury selection.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The court is not likely to grant the motion because the attorney has not shown good cause for the delay. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney had two months after the entry of the scheduling order to prepare for trial, and the fact that the attorney was busy is not sufficient to show good cause for extending the deadlines. B is incorrect. The mere passage of time is not a sufficient reason to grant a party's motion to extend the deadline to file a motion to extend the deadline for jury selection and trial. However, in this case, the court is not being asked to extend the deadline for jury selection and trial. Instead, the court is being asked to extend all of the deadlines two months beyond where they currently are. The fact that jury selection and trial are currently set for two months after the motions deadline expired is simply a statement of when the court hopes to get to that part of the case. It is not binding on the court, and the court can (and likely will) extend that deadline as well if it extends all of the other deadlines. C is incorrect. While it is true that \"additional time could facilitate settlement,\" (C) is not a sufficient reason to grant an extension of time. Parties are permitted to extend discovery deadlines only for \"good cause.\" The fact that additional time \"could facilitate settlement\" is not a good reason to extend discovery deadlines. As the Supreme Court has made clear, the good-cause standard requires something more than a mere hope that additional time \"could\" lead to a settlement. D is incorrect. The defendant does not need to show prejudice in order for the court to deny the motion. The plaintiff bears the burden of showing good cause for extending the discovery deadline.

Whether additional time could facilitate a settlement is immaterial, because it does not speak to whether the moving party can show the required diligence needed to establish good cause. Answer D is incorrect. The busy schedule of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not establish the good cause needed to amend the scheduling order, which is why the motion should be denied.

But for these allegations and defenses, the plaintiff's invoice would not support a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the defendant's counterclaim and the plaintiff's claim for breach would not be supported by the receipt alone. Therefore, B is not the best choice. Additionally, the motion should be granted as to the plaintiff's claim for breach because the plaintiff has alleged facts that show he is unlikely to succeed in his claim for breach since he has paid for the goods and the defendant has alleged facts to show he had a reasonable basis for refusing to deliver the goods (i.e., that the products were purchased under an ongoing contract in which the defendant had reasonable basis for refusing to deliver).

Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment.

The man denies fault for the decedent\u2019s death. At trial, the executor\u2019s only witness testifies that shortly before the accident he was riding 50 feet behind the man and saw the man rapidly approaching the decedent until they were only a few feet apart. This witness briefly looked away, heard an unusual noise, and immediately afterward saw the decedent and the decedent\u2019s bike on the ground. The man calls three witnesses, none of whom had met the decedent or the man before. Two riders testify that they were riding parallel to the man and never saw his bike touch the decedent\u2019s bike. A track attendant, who was stationed close to the area where the decedent fell, testifies that he was watching the track and never saw any contact between the decedent and the man. The man has moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the executor\u2019s evidence is sufficient for the jury to find for the executor.\nB. No, because there is a credibility dispute for the jury to resolve.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The man\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law presents a question of whether the executor has presented sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the executor. A party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law where a reasonable jury would not have a sufficient legal basis to find for the other party. Here, the only evidence the executor presented was that the man rapidly approached the decedent and then the decedent fell to her death. In opposition to the man\u2019s motion, the executor cannot point to any specific evidence that would support a finding that the man caused the decedent\u2019s death. Instead, the executor simply argues that a jury could find for the executor. Because the executor presented insufficient evidence to support a finding that the man caused the decedent\u2019s death, the man is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. A is incorrect. In order to find that the man caused the decedent\u2019s death, the jury would need to find that the man rapidly approached the decedent, looked away for a second, and then the decedent fell to her death. Even taking all inferences in the executor\u2019s favor, there is not sufficient evidence to support a finding for the executor. B is incorrect. There is no credibility dispute here because all of the evidence supports a finding for the man. The question of weight and credibility is relevant only where there is some evidence that would support a finding for the other party. Here, there is not. C is incorrect. The question of whether to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law does not involve a determination of whether a verdict would be against the great weight of the evidence.

In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial.

The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two.

If he cannot prove that, then he will have a harder time showing that he has a meritorious defense. B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to respond was not reasonable, even if he reasonably believed that he did not have to respond. CR 12(a)(2) allows a party to move for relief from a default judgment for \"excusable neglect.\" The Supreme Court, however, has held that \"excusable neglect\" does not include neglect due to a party's \"bad faith or'reckless disregard' for clear rules of law and procedure.\" See Pioneer Asset Management, Inc. v. Stuggi Holdings, Ltd., 563 U.S. 373, 397 (2011) (quoting Chugach Electric Corp. v. OPEC, 334 F.3d 1276, 1292 (10th Cir. 2003)) (other citations omitted). Here, the attorney likely recklessly disregarded clear rules of law in ignoring the lawsuit. Therefore, his failure to respond would not be considered \"excusable neglect.\" C is incorrect. The attorney confuses the concepts of personal jurisdiction and subject-matter jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction relates to a court's ability to require a defendant to submit to the court's judgment, while subject-matter jurisdiction relates to the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal dispute. Here, there is no argument that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the lawsuit (which would have been a void judgment). Rather, the attorney was served with a summons and complaint in State B and ignored the lawsuit in State A. Therefore, the court had personal jurisdiction over the attorney. Because he had reasonable notice of the suit and an opportunity to appear, the judgment is not void. See Bochenek v. A.P.S. Services, Inc., 649 F.3d 653, 655 (8th Cir. 2011) (explaining that a judgment is not void, but rather voidable, when a court that had personal jurisdiction entered a default judgment against a party who had reasonable notice of the suit and an opportunity to appear).

The employees have moved in the district court for an order certifying an immediate appeal of the grant of summary judgment on the federal-law claims because there is no just reason for delay.

No, because the federal-law claims are not separate and distinct from the state-law claims.\nC. Yes, because denying an immediate appeal may prejudice the employees by delaying their recovery.\nD.

It is not necessary that the claims be separate and distinct in order to certify an immediate appeal. In this case, there is no just reason to delay appeal of the grant of summary judgment and Appellate Rule 23(a) is inapplicable. C is incorrect. Denial of an immediate appeal does not prejudice a party. In fact, Appellate Rule 23(a) provides that a party may move for certification of an immediate appeal only when there is no just reason for delay.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The appeal is proper because there is an immediately appealable judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (a discretionary interlocutory appeal by the court of appeals). Here, the court entered an order that dismissed the federal claim, and the order was immediately enforceable. The order was also made finally as to the federal claim, which is enough for an appeal even if no other claims remain in the case. See United States v. Haddad, 459 U.S. 714 (1983) (when one claim is dismissed and there is no ruling or decision on the other claim, the dismissal of the first claim is treated as a final judgment). Thus, A is correct, and B is incorrect. C is incorrect. Although the court's order is an immediately appealable judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (a discretionary interlocutory appeal by the court of appeals), the appropriate analysis is whether the order is finally as to the federal claim, which it is. The fact that the state claim remains in the case does not prevent the appeal of the dismissal of the federal claim. See United States v. Haddad, 459 U.S. 714 (1983). D is incorrect. Although the court's order is finally as to the federal claim, the reason that the order is immediately appealable is because it is an immediately enforceable order. However, to be immediately appealable, the order must also satisfy one of several limited exceptions to the general rule that appeals may only be taken from final judgment. Here, the order is immediately appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (a discretionary interlocutory appeal by the court of appeals).\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As the state-law claim remains to be decided in the action, there is not yet a final judgment on the merits of the entire action, and thus an appeal is not allowed under the final judgment rule. Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Answer C is incorrect. To obtain a discretionary interlocutory appeal, the party seeking to appeal must apply to both the district and appellate courts to meet the statutory standards. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Because the scientist has appealed without attempting to satisfy that requirement, the appeal cannot be treated as a discretionary interlocutory appeal. Answer D is incorrect. Under the final judgment rule, a judgment is not final until all the claims in the action have been resolved. While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

Courts are divided about whether a buyer is required to search deeds outside of the chain of title to the land the buyer is purchasing. Here, the deed from the man to the woman is outside of the entrepreneur\u2019s chain of title even though they share a common grantor. Thus, knowing whether the jurisdiction\u2019s law puts a buyer on notice of all land transfers of the buyer\u2019s grantor, even those outside of the chain of title, is essential. If it does, the entrepreneur had a duty to search the title for the westerly tract. Answer A is incorrect. The type of index does not determine what instruments are in the chain of title. Answer B is incorrect. The recording system does not affect whether the entrepreneur is a good-faith purchaser for value. Answer D is incorrect. The intended use of the land does not affect the determination of whether the entrepreneur was aware of the recorded restriction.",

There is no applicable statute. The buyer sued the seller for damages and/or rescission of the contract. For whom will the court find?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. For the buyer, because an \u201cas is\u201d clause is per se unconscionable in a residential sales transaction.\nB. For the buyer, because she received a warranty deed.\nC.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The seller had no duty to disclose information about the property to the buyer. The buyer was an experienced land buyer and clearly stated that she was aware of the seller's lack of experience in real estate. For these reasons, the seller had no duty to disclose to the buyer any information about the property. When the seller asked if the buyer wanted to inspect the property, his offer was clear: take it as is or leave it. The buyer chose to take it. Therefore, the seller fulfilled his duty when he pointed out the opportunity for inspection. A is incorrect because an \"as is\" clause is not per se unconscionable in a residential sale. In fact, the \"as is\" clause in this fact pattern will likely be enforced, since the buyer clearly understood the property was being sold without warranty, and there are no other factors (such as fraud or misrepresentation) which might invalidate the contract. B is incorrect because the delivery of a warranty deed does not automatically render the buyer entitled to damages or rescission. In fact, the mere delivery of a deed will not excuse the buyer's performance or serve as a basis for damages or rescission unless there is fraud or misrepresentation related to the deed. Here, there was no fraud or misrepresentation. The contract was clear, and both parties performed under the contract. The buyer cannot now seek damages or rescission simply because she decided she did not want to complete the transaction. D is incorrect because there is no relationship between the delivery of a deed and the doctrine of merger. The merger doctrine is a rule that integrates title and evidence of title, usually by deeming the transfer of the title to be a transfer of all interest in the property. It has no application here, where neither party raised any issues with the title.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

A court will enforce an \u201cas is\u201d clause in residential sales as long as there is no positive misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment, neither of which is present in these facts. Answer B is incorrect. A warranty deed provides protection for title issues, not issues of physical condition. Answer D is incorrect. The merger doctrine is irrelevant.

A tenant with a serious hearing impairment asked permission from the landlord to keep a hearing-assistance service dog in her apartment to alert and assist her in the event of fire or other emergency. The landlord refused. Is the landlord\u2019s refusal likely a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the landlord lives in an apartment in the building.\nB. No, because the tenant agreed to the \u201cno pets\u201d provision in her lease.\nC. Yes, because the landlord\u2019s refusal is arbitrary.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities and requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations in their policies to assist people with disabilities. This accommodation does not arbitarily threaten the health or safety of others, but would greatly assist the tenant in living independently. Therefore, the landlord's failure to make this accommodation is likely a violation of the Fair Housing Act. A is incorrect because the landlord's apartment is also a residence that is part of the landlord's business, and he may not discriminate against people with disabilities or fail to make reasonable accommodations for them. B is incorrect because the tenant is entitled to a reasonable accommodation that her lease does not explicitly allow. Such accommodations are permitted by the Fair Housing Act. C is incorrect because the refusal to allow a hearing-assistance dog is not arbitrary. It is designed to enforce a pet-free environment, which is a legitimate goal. However, it has the effect of discriminating against people with disabilities who use such dogs to assist them, and this effect is not justified here because accommodating the tenant's dog would not interfere with that goal.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

Answer B is incorrect.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC.

Under the priority rules, the investor\u2019s mortgage would have remained in place even if the investor had not exercised its right to cure. B is incorrect. The seller\u2019s mortgage being a purchase money mortgage (PMM) means it covers the entire tract of land and is secured by first priority. However, this does not affect the status of any other mortgage on that land. Therefore, even though the seller\u2019s mortgage is a PMM, the investor\u2019s mortgage can still be on there and be valid. C is incorrect. A deed in lieu of foreclosure affects only the rights of the mortgagor and the mortgagee and does not affect the rights of holders of junior mortgages. Therefore, the developer\u2019s deed in lieu of foreclosure to the seller would not eliminate the investor\u2019s mortgage. D is correct.

A mortgagor\u2019s later-executed mortgage generally can be extinguished only by foreclosure. Thus, the holder of the senior lien (the seller) should have searched the title to determine if a junior lien existed and, if so, brought a foreclosure action to extinguish it rather than accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Answer A is incorrect. The status of the investor, the junior lienholder, is not affected by that lienholder\u2019s failure to cure the mortgagor\u2019s default. Answer B is incorrect. The general rule that a deed in lieu of foreclosure does not extinguish subsequent mortgages is unaffected by whether the senior lien was a purchase money mortgage or not. Answer D is incorrect.

The buyer financed the purchase, in part, with a $250,000 loan from a bank, secured by a mortgage on the house. Before the closing, the buyer\u2019s attorney advised him to purchase a standard-form, $300,000 title insurance policy naming the buyer as the insured. Because the buyer had forgotten to bring his checkbook to the closing, his son, who had accompanied him to the closing, paid the premium for him. One year later, the buyer died. Under his will, the house passed to his son. Two years later, the son was successfully sued by a previous record owner with a superior title to the house. The previous owner\u2019s claim had not been excepted in the buyer\u2019s title insurance policy through the carelessness of a title company employee. At the time of the lawsuit, the house was still subject to the bank\u2019s mortgage. The son immediately sought indemnification for the loss from the title insurance company. Is the son entitled to indemnification from the title insurance company?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the son was not named as an insured on the title policy.\nB. No, because when a mortgage remains outstanding, a title policy protects only the mortgagee from any loss.\nC. Yes, because the house passed to the son under the buyer\u2019s will.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The mortgagee is always named as the insured in a title insurance policy, and is protected from loss caused by title defects. The rule that the mortgagee is entitled to indemnification for loss caused by title defects is strictly applied, and the mortgagee is not required to exercise any care with respect to the title. The mortgagor, on the other hand, is not entitled to indemnification for loss caused by title defects, and is required to exercise reasonable care to protect herself from loss caused by such defects. Therefore, it makes no difference that the son sought indemnification as the mortgagor, or that he paid the premium. Instead, the bank is entitled to indemnification for its loss resulting from the superior title of the previous owner. A is incorrect because it suggests that only the named insured can recover for loss caused by title defects. However, as explained above, it is the mortgagee who is entitled to be named as the insured, not the mortgagor. C is incorrect because the method by which the son obtained ownership of the house does not change his status as mortgagor. He is still the person who is required to exercise reasonable care with respect to title, and is not entitled to indemnification for loss caused by title defects.

The applicable zoning law required that any home in the community be surrounded by at least two acres of vacant land. The man built a home on the land that fully complied with the zoning law and moved into it. Subsequently, the man was diagnosed with a chronic debilitating disease. He told his daughter that he might have to sell his home, go to a nursing home, and after exhausting his assets paying for nursing home care, go on Medicaid for the rest of his life. His daughter offered to take care of him for the rest of his life if he would build her a small home on the westerly portion of his land. The man agreed, but because there was no way to site a home on the westerly portion of the land so that it was surrounded by two acres of vacant land, he applied to the local zoning board for a variance. Should the variance be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because hardship variances are not granted where the land is used for residential purposes.\nB.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Variances are granted at the discretion of the zoning board, but to even consider granting a variance the applicant must show: 1) that without the variance the landowner would suffer a hardship, 2) that the hardship was created by the zoning ordinance, and 3) that the variance would alleviate the hardship. The man fails to satisfy the first element, as the restriction imposed by the zoning ordinance does not constitute a hardship for the man. A variance is a relief from the ordinary requirements of a zoning ordinance, and as such it is only available to alleviate a hardship, not to accommodate general inconvenience or increased cost. Therefore, while the man may incur significant expense in relation to the proposed variance, this increased cost will not constitute a hardship, and thus the zoning board should deny the application. A is incorrect because it misstates the law regarding covenants. While it is true that a developer may impose use restrictions on land that it develops and sells, these restrictions are governed by the covenant and do not impact the zoning ordinance. There is no rule of law that covenants relating to use will also be included in zoning ordinances. C is incorrect because it misstates the law regarding variances. While it is true that variances are only granted at the discretion of the zoning board, the decision to grant a variance is based on whether the applicant has satisfied the elements listed above, not whether the proposed use is consistent with a covenant in a warranty deed. D is incorrect because it misstates the law regarding variances.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other. Which party is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because a default will be implied by the court under these facts.\nB.

The man was current on his payments and had 30 days to cure the default before the bank could start the foreclosure process. Furthermore, the man's actions enhanced the value of the property, so the bank suffered no loss. Therefore, the bank cannot prevail in the foreclosure action. A is incorrect because the man has 30 days to cure the default before the court will imply a default. B is incorrect because although the man did violate the terms of the mortgage, he has 30 days to cure the default before the bank can start the foreclosure process, and he is current on his mortgage payments and property insurance.

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire. Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is possible that a third party wrongfully let the cattle out of the pen.\nB.

Res ipsa loquitur applies to situations where it is probable that the accident would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant's negligence and where the defendant had control over the instrumentality that caused the injury. The doctrine allows the jury to draw an inference of negligence from the accident itself. In this case, cattle escaping from a pen and wandering into the road is the type of accident that would not ordinarily happen in the absence of negligence by the person in control of the cattle. Therefore, the trial court should allow the case to go to the jury on a res ipsa loquitur instruction. A is incorrect. The fact that a third party might have wrongfully let the cattle out of the pen does not preclude the application of res ipsa loquitur if the jury finds that it is more likely than not that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. B is incorrect. Res ipsa loquitur does not require proof of specific negligence on the part of the defendant. In fact, one of the purposes of res ipsa loquitur is to allow a jury to find for the plaintiff in a situation where it is unclear what exactly went wrong. C is incorrect.

However, the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support a finding\u2014required for battery liability\u2014that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect.

The construction company mixed the sand with water and cement to make concrete. The distributor knew that an improper ratio of sand, water, and cement would result in defective concrete, but the distributor played no role in determining the ratio used by the construction company in mixing the concrete. The construction company used the concrete to form supporting columns for a building. A year later, the building collapsed during a minor earthquake, causing injury to the occupants. Although the sand was not defective, the concrete forming the columns was defective because the mixture ratio of the sand, water, and cement was not proper. The defective concrete was a cause in fact of the collapse. Do the injured building occupants have viable strict liability claims against the sand distributor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because component suppliers are not strictly liable in tort.\nB. No, because the distributor neither advised nor participated with the construction company in determining the mixture of sand, water, and cement.\nC.

The sand distributor provided a component part, which was integrated into the final product by the construction company. Therefore, A is incorrect. A and C fail to take into account the component parts rule. B is correct.

In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer A is incorrect. The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met). Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer D is incorrect.

The grocery store contends that its alleged negligence was not a proximate cause of any of the injuries allegedly caused by the doctor. Should the court allow the doctor to implead the grocery store?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The facts do not indicate that the shopper has brought an action against the grocery store. Therefore, the doctor cannot bring a contribution action against the grocery store at this time. The doctor may, however, bring a third-party action against the grocery store to seek damages if he is found liable to the shopper. A court allows a third-party claim to be filed when the original lawsuit and the third-party claim involve: 1) the original defendant\u2019s alleged negligent act was the cause in fact of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, 2) the original defendant\u2019s alleged negligent act and the third-party defendant\u2019s alleged negligent act were concurrent causes 3) the original defendant\u2019s alleged negligent act and the third-party defendant\u2019s alleged negligent act were alternative causes.

The store regularly gave repeat customers empty boxes to promote goodwill. Seeing no boxes outside, the student entered the store and asked a store employee for help. The employee pointed toward the rear of the store and said that all the empty boxes were in the storeroom. The student went into the storeroom through a door with a sign that said: \u201cKeep Out. Employees Only.\u201d While in the storeroom, she tripped on a fold in a floor mat and fell into a stack of wooden crates. The topmost crate fell on the student, causing a head injury. The student has sued the store to recover for her injury. Which statement below is the most appropriate characterization of the student and her conduct under traditional common law rules?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The student assumed the risk, because she knew that the storeroom was not normally accessible to the public.\nB. The student was a licensee in the store, because she had no intention of making a purchase at the store during the box-hunting visit.\nC. The student was a trespasser in the storeroom, because she ignored the sign on the door barring entrance to the storeroom.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. At common law a landowner who invites or permits others to enter his land for an invited purpose: 1) owes a duty of care to all business visitors to eliminate, or warn against, any hidden dangers or defects on the premises that the visitor does not know or have reason to discover, 2) owes a duty to licensees and invitees to exercise reasonable care in the state of the conditions and the premises or to warn them of hidden dangers or defects, and 3) owes a duty to trespassers only to avoid acts that would foreseeably cause harm. An invitee is a business visitor who enters the land of another to transact business for the benefit of the landowner. Because the store regularly gave repeat customers (such as the student) empty boxes, and the store\u2019s doors were wide open allowing access to all repeat customers, the student had the landowner\u2019s permission to enter the store and, therefore, was an invitee. The student was therefore owed a duty by the store to eliminate, or warn against, any hidden dangers or defects in the storeroom that the student did not know or have reason to discover. The student\u2019s knowledge of the storeroom being off limits would not eliminate or reduce the store\u2019s duty to make the storeroom safe or to warn her about hidden dangers because the student\u2019s knowledge was not of a hidden danger but rather of the storeroom\u2019s purpose and restricted access to it. The student\u2019s knowledge of the storeroom would, however, serve as a bar to recovery if she failed to appreciate or make use of the store\u2019s exercise of care to eliminate or warn against hidden dangers in the storeroom. The student\u2019s actual knowledge of the storeroom would not serve as a bar to recovery in this case, however, because the store did not exercise care to eliminate or warn against hidden dangers in the storeroom. The student\u2019s knowledge of the storeroom being off limits would not serve to assume the risk in this case because the student was not aware of any hidden dangers or defects that the store had failed to eliminate or warn against.

The principal informed the student\u2019s parents of the bus driver\u2019s report and told them that, because of the student\u2019s behavior, the student could not ride the bus for the next week and would have to be driven to school by a parent. The following Monday morning, after the bus driver had let the children off the bus in front of the school, but before she could close the door and drive away, the student\u2019s father pulled his car directly in front of her bus, blocking the driver\u2019s path. Because there was another bus right behind hers, the driver was unable to move her bus. The father got out of his car and strode toward the open door of the bus, screaming at the driver: \u201cYou messed with the wrong family! I am going to get you!\u201d Feeling threatened, the bus driver quickly closed the door. The father pounded on the door with enough force to dent it, screaming obscenities at the driver, until a school security guard intervened.

The father closed his car door to within a foot or so of the bus driver\u2019s face, screamed furiously in her face, and then began to beat on the door of the bus. These actions clearly would be sufficient to put an average person in fear of an immediate battery. Thus, the father was guilty of assault. However, assault is a lesser offense than the actions the driver experienced, so there must be a higher offense available. C is incorrect. The father\u2019s actions were directed at the bus, not at causing a high degree of emotional distress to the driver through words or actions. In order to make a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show that the defendant intentionally caused the plaintiff severe emotional distress. A defendant's actions are considered intentional for liability purposes if they are committed intentionally or, if they are committed negligently, the negligence is of such a nature that it should have been foreseeable that severe emotional distress would result. Severe emotional distress can be inferred from the plaintiff's presence at the scene, the defendant's actions, and the plaintiff's reactions. In this case, the father's actions were not intentionally directed at causing severe emotional distress to the driver through words or actions. Instead, the father became enraged when he saw the bus driver, and he acted on that rage. The driver's emotional distress would more properly be compensationable under an assault theory. B is incorrect. The father did not make contact with the driver, so there was no actual battery. However, the father's close approach to the driver, viewed in light of his screaming in her face and pounding on the door of the bus, clearly would be sufficient to put an average person in fear of an immediate battery. Thus, the father was guilty of assault. However, assault is a lesser offense than the actions the driver experienced, so there must be a higher offense available. A is incorrect. Although the father's actions were clearly an assault, they also interfered with the use of his bus, so there may be additional claims available. The bus was interfered with, touched, and damaged, so the driver may also have a claim for trespass to chattels. A is incorrect.

Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle. The supervisor told the dispatcher that he should quit if he couldn\u2019t handle the increased hours. Over the next three months, the dispatcher continued to complain about the working conditions, to no effect. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury. He eventually was hospitalized and had to miss several months of work as a result of the emotional distress. The dispatcher sued the trucking company for negligence. The company has moved for summary judgment, based on the undisputed facts set out above. Assume that there is no applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute. How should the court rule on the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny the motion, because the jury must determine the extent of the emotional distress suffered by the dispatcher.\nB. Deny the motion, because there is evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the supervisor failed to act with ordinary care.\nC. Grant the motion, because the dispatcher suffered no physical injury.\nD. Grant the motion, because there is no evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the supervisor acted carelessly with respect to the dispatcher\u2019s emotional well-being.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The dispatcher was not injured while working for the trucking company. There is no evidence that the supervisor failed to act with ordinary care. There is no evidence that the supervisor had a duty to provide a safe work environment, or that he breached such a duty. Therefore, there is no evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the supervisor acted carelessly with respect to the dispatcher's emotional well-being. A is incorrect. The call of the question asks whether the court should rule on the motion for summary judgment. The facts clearly support a grant of the motion. There is no material fact in dispute. B is incorrect. The call of the question asks whether the court should rule on the motion for summary judgment. The facts clearly support a grant of the motion. There is no material fact in dispute. C is incorrect. The issue here is whether the company was negligent in hiring a supervisor who made insensitive comments to the dispatcher.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Negligently caused emotional distress is ordinarily not actionable unless connected to a physical injury. Answer A is incorrect. Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty. As noted earlier, courts generally do not recognize a duty to take care against causing emotional distress unconnected to a physical injury. Answer D is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty.",

The manufacturer reserved the right to enter into additional such contracts with other State A distributors. The manufacturer knew that the distributor would, on the basis of the agreement, invest in an expansion of its distribution centers in State A in order to handle the distribution of the manufacturer\u2019s products to retail sellers in that state. At the time the manufacturer entered into the contract, it had already firmly decided to withdraw from the State A market in two years. Because the distributor had heard rumors of such a plan, its chief executive officer, before signing the contract, asked a representative of the manufacturer whether such a plan was in place. The representative denied the existence of any such plan. Two years into the contract, the manufacturer announced that it no longer intended to sell products in State A and canceled its contract with the distributor. The manufacturer did not thereafter supply products for distribution or sale in State A. Does the distributor have a viable fraud claim against the manufacturer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the distributor\u2019s exclusive remedy is for breach of contract.\nB. No, because the manufacturer did not misstate any material facts when entering into the contract.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer denied that it had a withdrawal plan when the distributor asked about it at the time the contract was formed.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. A claim for misrepresentation is a claim for fraud. To establish a fraud claim, a party must show: (1) a misrepresentation of material fact, (2) made with intent to deceive, (3) resulting in injury. Here, there were no misrepresented material facts. The contract stated that the manufacturer reserved the right to enter into additional contracts with other distributors. Any additional information the manufacturer may have provided about its plans for other contracts with distributors did not contradict the terms of the contract, and therefore, were not misrepresented material facts. Therefore, the distributor has not been injured by fraud, and answer B is correct. Answers C and D are incorrect because additional statements by the manufacturer, even if they were false, cannot supersede the express language of the contract, which was read and agreed to by both parties. Therefore, those statements cannot be the basis of a fraud action and are not material to the contract. A is incorrect because the manufacturer's misrepresentation of fact was not cured by the performance of the contract, and therefore, the distributor has a viable fraud claim in addition to its breach of contract claim.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

As such, it supports a fraud claim by the distributor. Answer A is incorrect. The distributor may sue for fraud regardless of whether the distributor also has a valid claim for breach of contract.

The packaging indicated that the pills were \u201ccoated\u201d but did not list the ingredients in the coating. A few days after she bought the medication, because the daughter was in extreme pain, the mother gave the daughter three times the recommended dose of the medication. Thirty minutes later, because the daughter had a very rare allergy to an ingredient in the coating, she had a severe allergic reaction, for which she was hospitalized. The mother was aware of the daughter\u2019s allergy, but she did not know that the medication contained the ingredient to which the daughter was allergic. In a failure-to-warn action brought against the manufacturer of the medication, which of the arguments below would be the LEAST promising as a defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter\u2019s allergy to the ingredient in the coating was very rare.\nB. The manufacturer\u2019s duty was to warn learned intermediaries, not consumers of the medication.\nC. The mother should not have given her daughter a triple dose of the medication.\nD.

        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is the least promising argument for the manufacturer. If the mother had not given the daughter three times the recommended dose, but had instead followed the package instructions, and still the daughter would have had a severe reaction, it is likely that the daughter would prevail in a failure to warn action against the manufacturer. Similarly, if the mother had not purchased the medication without ascertaining its ingredients, but had instead carefully followed the package instructions, and still the daughter would have had a severe reaction, it is likely that the daughter would prevail in a failure to warn action against the manufacturer. However, in question D, the mother was aware of her daughter's rare allergy, and gave her three times the recommended dose. Of the four choices, the rareness of the allergy, B, is likely to be the least effective argument for the manufacturer, because the fact that an allergy is rare will not serve as a complete defense to a failure to warn claim.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

The farmer did not communicate with the manufacturer of the milking system or any of its agents before purchasing the system. The distributor knew that the farmer had several lucrative contracts with milk wholesalers, but the manufacturer was unaware of these contracts. The system never operated properly because of a manufacturing defect, and as a result the dairy farmer lost much of the wholesale contract revenue. Does the farmer have a viable strict products liability claim against the manufacturer for recovery of his lost revenue?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because of the economic loss doctrine.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was not aware of the farmer\u2019s wholesale contracts.\nC. Yes, because the consequential damages rule of contract law does not apply in a products liability action in which the product was in fact defective.\nD. Yes, because the milking system\u2019s defect proximately caused the farmer\u2019s loss of revenue.\nResponse:\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",
        "response": "\n\n\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. To establish a products liability claim based on strict liability in tort, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the defendant produced, sold, and delivered the product, (2) the product was in a defective condition when it left the defendant's control, and (3) the defect was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. The farmer has a viable strict products liability claim against the manufacturer for recovery of his lost revenue because he was injured when he lost his wholesale contract revenue due to the defective milking system. Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect. The economic loss doctrine bars a plaintiff from asserting a claim in tort for purely economic losses. However, this doctrine has been modified to allow a plaintiff to bring a claim in tort for consequential economic damages resulting from a defective product. Therefore, the farmer can assert a claim in tort for his lost revenue, which were consequential damages. B is incorrect. The farmer does not need to show that the manufacturer knew of his wholesale contracts in order to bring a products liability claim. The manufacturer is strictly liable for the consequences of any defect in product. C is incorrect. While it is true that consequential damages rules of contract law do not apply in products liability actions in which the product was in fact defective, this is because the manufacturer is strictly liable for the consequences of any defect in the product. However, the farmer's lost revenue were not consequential damages under the contract rules. Instead, they were the damages that the farmer intended to avoid when he bought the system, and are therefore covered damages under a products liability claim.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

Answer B is incorrect. The problem is not the manufacturer\u2019s lack of knowledge about the farmer\u2019s contracts but the rule that prevents an injured party from recovering for purely economic loss caused by a defective product. Answer C is incorrect. The statement is true, but it does not entitle the farmer to damages. The contract law rule of consequential damages is irrelevant to the resolution of a tort claim.
