The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder.

When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA federal civil statute prohibited fishing in any body of water that was located within a national park and contained a particular endangered species of fish. The statute authorized federal district courts to enjoin knowing violators of the statute from the use of all national park facilities for up to two years. After a vacationer was found by a federal district court to have knowingly violated the statute, the court issued an injunction against his use of all national park facilities for two years. The vacationer appealed. Before the appeals court heard the vacationer's case, Congress repealed the statute by a law that expressly made the repeal effective retroactive to a date one month before the vacationer's violation of the statute. The law also directly cited the vacationer's case and stated that it was intended to \"repeal all the statutory prohibitions that formed the basis for decisions\" such as that rendered against the vacationer. On the basis of this law, the vacationer has asked the appeals court to vacate the injunction issued against him. Counsel for the United States has objected, contending that, as applied to the specific case pending in the appeals court, the law is unconstitutional. How should the appeals court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. For the United States, because Congress defied the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws by\nretroactively changing the consequences for violating the statute after the violation was proved in a trial court.\nB. For the United States, because the law's citation to the vacationer's case demonstrates that Congress intended to\ncompel the appeals court to reach a particular result and, therefore, sought to exercise judicial powers vested\nexclusively in the courts by Article III.\nC. For the vacationer, because Congress has the power to determine the laws to be applied by the federal courts and to\nrequire retroactive application of those laws to any specifically identified case that it chooses.\nD. For the vacationer, because Congress is authorized to make substantive changes to federal civil statutes and to direct\nthat those changes be applied by the courts to all actions in which a final judgment has not yet been rendered.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

A vacationer was found to have knowingly violated the statute, and an appeals court issued an injunction against his use of national park facilities for two years. The vacationer then appealed, and Congress repealed the statute with a law retroactive to the violation date, citing the vacationer's case and intending to \"repeal all the statutory prohibitions that formed the basis for this decision.\" The U.S. represents the argument that the appeals court should rule for the vacationer.\n\n### Rule application\nCongress has the power to determine the laws to be applied by federal courts and to require retroactive application of those laws to a specific case. This power is derived from the constitutional provision granting Congress the authority to make laws for the security of the United States and its citizens, as well as the authority to dispose of property belonging to the United States.

Throughout the civil war, the ruling faction controlled the majority of the country's territory, and the United States afforded diplomatic immunity to the ambassador representing the ruling faction. A newly elected President of the United States decided to recognize a rebel group as the government of the foreign country and notified the ambassador from the ruling faction that she must leave the United States within 10 days. The ambassador filed an action in federal district court for a declaration that the ruling faction was the true government of the foreign country and for an injunction against enforcement of the President's order that she leave the United States. The United States has moved to dismiss the action. If the court dismisses the action, what will be the most likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The President has decided to recognize a rebel group as the government of the foreign country, requiring the ambassador from the ruling faction to leave the country within 10 days. The ambassador is challenging this order in federal court, seeking a declaration that the ruling faction is the true government and an injunction against the President's order.\n\n### Rule application\nJudicial review of presidential actions is limited, particularly in areas of foreign relations and national security. The recognition of foreign governments falls under this category and is generally left to the discretion of the executive branch. Standing is also a threshold issue in suits against the President, requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate a personal stake in the outcome and a risk of direct harm from the challenged action.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven these principles, the court is likely to dismiss the ambassador's action for lack of standing or as a nonjusticiable political question. The action falls outside the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and the political questions at stake exceed the judicial role of resolving disputed questions of policy. Therefore, the correct verdict would be dismissal based on standing or political question, supporting option D.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man saved the life of his friend's wife who thereafter changed her will to leave the man $1000.

The husband's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. What is the likely decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Moreover, Article II provides no judicially manageable standards by which a court could review the constitutionality of a President's decision on whether to recognize a foreign government. Finally, because the action involves the President's administration of foreign affairs, the prudential elements of the political question doctrine also indicate that the court should dismiss the action as nonjusticiable.",

The other vehicle involved in the accident was a truck owned by a furniture manufacturer and driven by one of its employees. The manufacturer's headquarters are in State B. Its products are sold by retailers in State A, but it has no office, plant, or agent for service of process there. The motorist brought an action against the manufacturer in a state court in State A. The manufacturer appeared specially to contest that court's jurisdiction over it. The court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the manufacturer by virtue of State A's long-arm statute. At trial, the court instructed the jury to apply State A law, under which a plaintiff's contributory negligence is a basis for reducing an award of damages but not for denying recovery altogether. Under State B law, contributory negligence is a complete defense. The jury found that the manufacturer was negligent and that its negligence was a cause of the motorist's injuries. It also found that the motorist was negligent, though to a lesser degree than the manufacturer, and that the motorist's negligence contributed to the accident. It returned a verdict in favor of the motorist and awarded her $1 million in damages. The manufacturer appealed the judgment entered on this verdict, asserting error in the court's ruling on jurisdiction and in its application of State A law instead of State B law. The manufacturer raised all federal constitutional claims pertinent to these claims of error. The highest court in State A affirmed the trial court's judgment, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied the manufacturer's petition for a writ of certiorari. The motorist has brought an action against the manufacturer in a state court in State B to collect on the judgment. The manufacturer has defended on all relevant federal constitutional grounds. How should the State B court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. For the manufacturer, because a judgment entered by a court that lacks jurisdiction over one of the parties is not\nentitled to full faith and credit, and the State A court could not constitutionally assert jurisdiction over the\nmanufacturer because of the manufacturer's lack of a presence in that state.\nB. For the manufacturer, because the State A court was bound by the full faith and credit clause to apply State B law to\nan accident that occurred in State B and in which a State B company was involved.\nC. For the motorist, because the manufacturer litigated the issues of jurisdiction and choice of law in the State A court,\nand the final judgment of that court is entitled to full faith and credit in the State B court.\nD.

Congress appropriated a fixed sum of money to fund loans made pursuant to the program and gave a designated federal agency discretion to decide which applicants were to receive the loans. Two weeks after the program was established, a family farmer applied to the agency for a loan. Agency officials promptly reviewed her application and summarily denied it.

The farmer claims that she could have proved at such a hearing that without the federal loan it would be necessary for her to sell her farm. Should the court uphold the agency's decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nSelf-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside. When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA state law imposed substantial regulations on insurance companies operating within the state with respect to their rates, cash reserves, and financial practices. A privately owned insurance company operating within the state advertised that it wanted to hire a new data processor. After reviewing applications for that position, the company hired a woman who appeared to be well qualified. The company refused to consider the application of a man who was better qualified than the woman, because he was known to have radical political views. The man sued the company, alleging only a violation of his federal constitutional right to freedom of expression. Is the man likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because hiring decisions are wholly discretionary and thus are not governed by the First Amendment.\nB. No, because the company is not subject to the provisions of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nC. Yes, because the company is affected with a public interest.\nD. Yes, because the company is substantially regulated by the state, and thus its employment decisions may fairly be\nattributed to the state.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Because female students at the school considered it unfashionable to wear shorts cut at or below the knee, they no longer wore shorts to school. On the other hand, male students at the school regularly wore shorts cut at or below the knee because they considered such shorts to be fashionable. Female students sued to challenge the constitutionality of the dress code on the ground that it denied them the equal protection of the laws. Should the court uphold the dress code?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the dress code is not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\nB.

Female students brought suit against the dress code, challenging its constitutionality under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n### Rule application\nFor a school dress code to be valid under the Equal Protection Clause, it must be narrowly tailored to further a substantial state interest, taking into account alternative means of achieving the same result. The court should uphold the dress code in this scenario due to its specific application to a particular clothing item and its relevance to the educational mission of the school.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the dress code specifically targets a clothing item and is not broadly applied, it meets the requirements for a narrowly tailored policy. Therefore, the court should uphold the dress code, supporting option C.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man and a woman owned Brownacre as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.

The company acquired mining equipment and began to plan its mining operations. Just as the company was about to begin mining, Congress enacted a statute that imposed a number of new environmental regulations and land-reclamation requirements on all mining operations within the United States. The statute made the company's planned mining operations economically infeasible. As a result, the company sold the tract of land to a farmer. While the sale price allowed the company to recover its original investment in the land, it did not cover the additional cost of the mining equipment the company had purchased or the profits it had expected to earn from its mining operations on the land. In an action filed against the appropriate federal official, the company claims that the statute effected a taking of its property for which it is entitled to just compensation in an amount equal to the cost of the mining equipment it purchased and the profits it expected to earn from its mining operations on the land. Which of the following is the most appropriate result in the action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The company should prevail on its claims for the cost of the mining equipment and for its lost profits.\nB. The company should prevail on its claim for the cost of the mining equipment, but not for its lost profits.\nC.

As a result, the company sold the land at a loss, having incurred the cost of mining equipment and expectations of profit.\n\n### Rule application\nA regulatory taking occurs when a government action denies an owner the use or enjoyment of their property without compensation. The Supreme Court has identified two types of regulatory takings: (1) the 'totality of the circumstances' test, considering the severity and duration of the regulation, the compensatory value of the property taken, and the government's interest in the regulation; and (2) the 'permanent physical taking' test, where the regulation physically deprives the owner of all economically beneficial use of the property. In this scenario, the company has suffered a regulatory taking under both tests, entitling it to compensation for the cost of the mining equipment and lost profits.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the federal statute made the mining operations economically infeasible, the company is entitled to compensation for the cost of the mining equipment and lost profits.

Although PTSD is a possible result of a car accident, it is not common. Many accident victims in a particular state who received the mailings complained that the mailings were disturbing and were an invasion of their privacy. These victims also reported that as a result of the mailings, their regard for psychotherapists and for psychotherapy as a form of treatment had diminished. In response, the state enacted a law prohibiting any licensed psychotherapist from sending mailings that raised the concern of PTSD to any car accident victim in the state until 30 days after the accident. The state justified the law as an effort to address the victims' complaints as well as to protect the reputation of psychotherapy as a form of treatment. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law singles out one type of message for prohibition while allowing others.\nB. No, because the mailings provide information to consumers.\nC. Yes, because mailings suggesting the possibility of developing PTSD as the result of an accident are misleading.\nD.

This action was in response to complaints from accident victims and a goal of protecting the reputation of psychotherapy as a form of treatment.\n\n### Rule application\nThe First Amendment allows states to regulate commercial speech through content-based time, place, and manner restrictions as long as the restrictions are designed to promote a substantial government interest and are narrowly tailored to achieve this goal. This applies to state laws that restrict commercial speech as opposed to federal laws that only regulate commercial speech.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the law prohibits licensed psychotherapists from sending mailings raising the concern of PTSD for 30 days after an accident, this restriction is related to the content of the message and is a time, place, and manner restriction on commercial speech. Therefore, the law is evaluated under the standards for evaluating commercial speech under the First Amendment. As long as the restriction is designed to promote a substantial government interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve this goal, it would be constitutional.

Its opposition prevented the mine from being opened on schedule. In an effort to force the organization to withdraw its opposition, certain residents of the town attended a meeting of the organization and tried to become members, but the officers refused to admit them. The residents sued the organization, claiming that the refusal to admit them was discriminatory and violated a local ordinance that prohibits any organization from discriminating on the basis of an individual's political views. The organization responded that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to its membership decisions. Are the residents likely to prevail in their claim?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Some scientific evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted from poultry to humans. Poultry farming is a major industry in several U.S. states. In one such state, the legislature has enacted a law imposing a fee of two cents per bird on all poultry farming and processing operations in the state. The purpose of the fee is to pay for a state inspection system to ensure that no poultry raised or processed in the state is infected with the virus. A company that has poultry processing plants both in the state and in other states has sued to challenge the fee. Is the fee constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because although it attaches only to intrastate activity, in the aggregate, the fee substantially affects interstate\ncommerce.\nB. No, because it places an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the negative implications of the\ncommerce clause.\nC. Yes, because it applies only to activities that take place wholly within the state, and it does not unduly burden\ninterstate commerce.\nD.

This fee is being challenged as unconstitutional by a company that operates poultry processing plants in the state and elsewhere.\n\n### Rule application\nThe constitutional requirement of apportioning taxes or other fees on activities affecting interstate commerce stems from the negative implications of the commerce clause, which prohibits burdens on such activities unjustified by their relative importance to national economic welfare. This principle prioritizes the protection of interstate commerce over the authority of states to tax.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the fee at issue is imposed solely on poultry farming and processing operations in the state and does not substantially affect interstate commerce in aggregate, it falls under the category of taxes applying only to activities that take place wholly within a state.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense.

Two years after the term began, the tenant subleased the building to a sublessee for a 5-year term. Under the terms of the sublease, the sublessee agreed to make monthly rent payments to the tenant. Although the sublessee made timely rent payments to the tenant, the tenant did not forward four of those payments to the landlord. The tenant has left the jurisdiction and cannot be found. The landlord has sued the sublessee for the unpaid rent. There is no applicable statute. If the court rules that the sublessee is not liable to the landlord for the unpaid rent, what will be the most likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. A sublessee is responsible to the landlord only as a surety for unpaid rent owed by the tenant.\nB. The sublease constitutes a novation of the original lease.\nC.

The sublessee is being sued by the landlord for unpaid rent.\n\n### Rule application\nThe landlord can disgorge the sublessee's profits from the sublease if the sublessee received the benefit of the bargain while breaching the contract.

The woman mailed the deed to the son with a letter saying: \"Because I intend you and your wife to have my house after my death, I am enclosing a deed to the house. However, I intend to live in the house for the rest of my life, so don't record the deed until I die. The deed will be effective at my death.\" The son put the deed in his desk. The wife discovered the deed and recorded it without the son's knowledge. Subsequently, the son and the wife separated, and the wife, without telling anyone, conveyed her interest in the house to a friend who immediately reconveyed it to the wife. The woman learned that the son and the wife had separated and also learned what had happened to the deed to the house. The woman then brought an appropriate action against the son and the wife to obtain a declaration that the woman was still the owner of the house and an order canceling of record the woman's deed and the subsequent deeds. If the court determines that the woman owns the house in fee simple, what will be the likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The deed was not delivered.\nB.

However, the wife discovered the deed and secretly recorded it, while the son kept the deed in his desk. The woman then learned of this and brought an action to declare her ownership and cancel the defective title.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder the doctrine of fee simple determinable, a tenant in common can convert their interest to a life estate under certain conditions, including when the tenant in common has a remaining interest that is determinable by will or by agreement and is not subject to an executory or contingent interest. In this scenario, the woman's express reservation of a life estate, her lack of consideration for the deed, and the wife's misconduct in secretly recording the deed all point towards a life estate.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the woman expressly reserved a life estate in the property and that the wife's recording of the deed without the son's knowledge constituted misconduct, the court is likely to award the woman a life estate in the property.

The friend paid value for the land, but failed to conduct a title search beforehand and promptly recorded the deed. The mother later died and the will was admitted to probate. The son then refused to convey the land to the friend despite the friend's request for a new deed.\n\n### Rule application\nThe doctrine of frustration of purpose allows the frustration of an intention where a voluntary act prevents the performance of a legal obligation. In this scenario, the friend's failure to conduct a title search before purchasing the land would constitute frustration if the land was unavailable due to title issues.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the land was devided through a will and subsequently passed through probate, the friend's purchase of the land may have rendered the son's interest in the land unavailable. Therefore, the friend may prevail based on frustration of purpose, supporting option A.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man was engaged to marry a woman. One evening, the man became enraged at the comments of the woman's eight-year-old daughter who was complaining in her usual fashion that she did not want her mother to marry the man. The man, who had too much to drink, began beating her. The daughter suffered some bruises and a broken arm. The woman took her daughter to the hospital. The police were notified by the hospital staff. The man was indicted for felony child abuse. At his trial, the man testified that, although he had become enraged, he had not intentionally beaten the daughter but, in fact, had been aiming for his wife. He also testified to his binge and ailment on the night of the incident. The jury found the man guilty. On appeal, he contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction.

The eastern portion of the land was undeveloped and unused. A farmer owned a farm, the western border of which was along the eastern border of the man's land. The two tracts of land had never been in common ownership. Five years ago, the farmer asked the man for permission to use a designated two acres of the eastern portion of the man's land to enlarge her farm's irrigation facilities. The man orally gave his permission for such use. Since then, the farmer has invested substantial amounts of money and effort each year to develop and maintain the irrigation facilities within the two-acre parcel. The man has been fully aware of the farmer's actions. Nothing regarding this matter was ever reduced to writing. Last year, the man gave the entire tract of land as a gift to his nephew. The deed of gift made no reference to the farmer or the two-acre parcel. When the nephew had the land surveyed and discovered the facts, he notified the farmer in writing, \"Your license to use the two-acre parcel has been terminated.\" The notice instructed the farmer to remove her facilities from the two-acre parcel immediately. The farmer refused the nephew's demand. In an appropriate action between the nephew and the farmer to determine whether the farmer had a right to continue to use the two-acre parcel, the court ruled in favor of the farmer.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

The property included a large store and a parking lot. At the start of the lease period, the tenant took possession and with the landlord's oral consent installed counters, display cases, shelving, and special lighting. Both parties complied with all lease terms. The lease is set to expire next month. Two weeks ago, when the landlord contacted the tenant about a possible lease renewal, she learned that the tenant had decided not to renew the lease, and that the tenant planned to remove all of the above-listed items on or before the lease termination date. The landlord claimed that all the items had become part of the real estate and had to remain on the premises. The tenant asserted his right and intention to remove all the items. Both the lease and the statutes of the jurisdiction are silent on the matter in dispute. At the time the landlord consented and the tenant installed the items, nothing was said about the tenant's right to retain or remove the items. The landlord has sued the tenant to enjoin his removal of the items. How is the court likely to rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. For the landlord, because the items have become part of the landlord's real estate.\nB. For the landlord as to items bolted or otherwise attached to the premises, and for the tenant as to items not attached to\nthe premises other than by weight.\nC.

The lease is silent on the issue of accession.\n\n### Rule application\nThe tenant has a right to remove accessiones as a matter of right at the end of a lease term, provided that the landlord consents to the accession and the lease is silent on the issue. In this scenario, the landlord consented to the installation of accessiones and the lease is silent on accession.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the tenant has a right to remove accessiones as a matter of right at the end of a lease term, the court is likely to rule in favor of the tenant. Option C, which provides for the tenant to remove accessiones as a matter of right with the obligation to restore the premises or pay for the cost of restoration, aligns with this legal concept.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A plaintiff sued a defendant for breach of contract.

The man has never physically occupied the land. Nineteen years ago, a woman entered the farm. The character and duration of the woman's possession of the farm caused her to become the owner of the farm under the adverse possession law of the jurisdiction. Three years ago, when the woman was not present, a neighbor took over possession of the farm. The neighbor repaired fences, put up \"no trespassing\" signs, and did some plowing. When the woman returned, she found the neighbor in possession of the farm. The neighbor vigorously rejected the woman's claimed right to possession and threatened force. The woman withdrew. The woman then went to the man and told him of the history of activity on the farm. The woman orally told the man that she had been wrong to try to take his farm. She expressly waived any claim she had to the land. The man thanked her. Last month, unsure of the effect of her conversation with the man, the woman executed a deed purporting to convey the farm to her son. The son promptly recorded the deed. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Who now owns the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The man, because the woman's later words and actions released title to the man.\nB. The neighbor, because the neighbor succeeded to the woman's adverse possession title by privity of possession.\nC. The son, because he succeeded to the woman's adverse possession title by privity of conveyance.\nD.

Nineteen years ago, the woman entered the farm and was deemed to become the owner through adverse possession due to her length of possession and absence of the owner. Nineteen years later, the woman handed over possession to the neighbor, who then repaired fences and put up \"no trespassing\" signs. The woman later returned and found the neighbor in possession. The neighbor rejected the woman's claimed title and asserted possession, leading the woman to give up her claim and convey the land to her son.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder the doctrine of acquisitive prescription, title can be acquired by continuous, uninterrupted, non-hostile possession for a prescribed period, typically 30 years. In this scenario, the neighbor would likely succeed in claiming title through adverse possession from the woman, transferring it to the son, due to the proximity in time between the woman's acquisition of title and the neighbor's taking possession.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor succeeded to the woman's adverse possession title by proximate succession, the son would likely be deemed to own the farm. Therefore, the correct verdict would be option B, transfer of title from one possessor to another due to adverse possession.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A defendant was charged with the crime of obstructing justice by concealing records subpoenaed May 1, in a government investigation.

The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the grand jury proceeding had been time-barred by the statute of limitations.

At the closing, the buyer signed a promissory note to the seller for 15% of the purchase price but did not execute a mortgage. The bank knew of the loan made by the seller and of the promissory note executed by the buyer to the seller. The buyer also signed a note to the bank, secured by a mortgage, for the 80% advanced by the bank. The buyer has now defaulted on both loans. There are no applicable statutes. Which loan has priority?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank's loan, because the seller can finance a part of the purchase price only by use of an installment land contract.\nB. The bank's loan, because it was secured by a purchase-money mortgage.\nC. The seller's loan, because a promissory note to a seller has priority over a bank loan for residential property.\nD.

The seller agreed to finance 15% and the buyer provided the remaining 5%. At the closing, the buyer executed a promissory note to the seller for 15% of the purchase price, but did not execute a mortgage. The bank knew of the seller's financing and the promissory note executed by the buyer. The buyer also signed a note to the bank, secured by a mortgage, for the 80% loan. The buyer has since defaulted on both loans, with no applicable statutes.\n\n### Rule application\nAccording to the rule, a mortgage given by a seller to finance a portion of a purchase price has priority over a bank loan secured by a mortgage. This priority is based on the nature of the seller's mortgage, which secures an obligation payable to the seller and runs only to the property purchased. In contrast, a bank mortgage runs to the property and secures an obligation payable to the bank.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the seller's mortgage runs only to the property purchased, it has priority over the bank loan secured by a mortgure. Therefore, the correct verdict would be option C, prioritizing the seller's mortgage over the bank loan.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landowner owned Blueacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. Without the landowner's knowledge, a nearby farmer entered Blueacre in 1980 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse.

            "explanation": "The bank has a purchase-money mortgage, because the loan proceeds were used to help purchase the land. A purchase-money mortgage, executed at the same time as the deed to the land, takes precedence over any other lien that attaches to the property. The seller's loan could also have been secured by a purchase-money mortgage, but it was not; the buyer signed an unsecured note to the seller. The seller also may have had an equitable vendor's lien for the unpaid purchase price, but the deed recites that the full consideration was paid. Therefore, the bank's purchase-money mortgage takes priority over the seller's unsecured loan and any implied equitable vendor's lien even if the bank knew of the vendor's lien.",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

When she arrived, she was taken into the grand jury room to be questioned. She answered preliminary questions about her name and address. She was then asked where she had been at a certain time on a specified night when a murder had occurred. Before answering the question, the woman said that she wanted to consult her attorney, who was waiting outside the grand jury room, and she was allowed to do so. When she returned to the grand jury room, she stated that she refused to answer the question because the answer might incriminate her. The prosecutor believes that the woman's nephew committed the murder. The nephew has said that he was with the woman at the time of the murder, and the prosecutor believes that this alibi is false. The prosecutor does not believe that the woman is guilty of the murder, either as a principal or as an accomplice, although he does believe that the woman may be guilty of other crimes. The prosecutor wants to compel the woman to answer the question by whatever means will result in the least harm to the prosecution's case. Which of the following steps should the prosecutor take to get the woman to answer the question?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Request the grand jury to order the woman to answer the question.\nB. Ask the woman's attorney to explain to the woman that the rules of evidence do not apply in grand jury proceedings,\nand to advise her that she cannot refuse to testify.\nC.

She refused to answer certain questions concerning her whereabouts at the time of the murder due to a fear of incrimination. The prosecutor believes that the woman's nephew committed the murder and that her alibi is false. The prosecutor is seeking to compel the woman to answer the question under threat of immunity.\n\n### Rule application\nPrior consistent statements of a grand jury witness may be used to impeach their testimony upon proof that the statements were made before evidence heard by the grand jury and were inconsistent with it. This rule is found in Rule 8.21 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the prosecutor is seeking to compel the woman to answer the question under threat of immunity, the best option would be for the prosecutor to ask the woman's attorney to explain to the woman that the rules of evidence do not apply in grand jury proceedings and to advise her that she cannot refuse to testify. This would allow the prosecutor to introduce prior consistent statements made by the woman to impeach her testimony if she refuses to answer the question after being granted immunity. Option B, requesting the grand jury to order the woman to answer the question, would not be effective in this scenario as it relies on the discretion of the grand jury and may not be enforced by contempt. Options A and C involve granting immunity to the woman which would not be appropriate in this scenario as the prosecutor does not believe that the woman is guilty of the murder and does not intend to use her testimony in any future prosecution.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man was arrested for speeding and while in custody he was given a card with the telephone number of a lawyer on it.

When an interrogator asked the defendant, \"Do you understand your Miranda rights, and are you willing to give up those rights and talk to us?\" the defendant replied, \"Yes.\" When asked, \"Did you kill the clerk?\" the defendant replied, \"No.\" When asked, \"Where were you on the day the clerk was killed?\" the defendant replied, \"Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.\" The interrogator asked, \"Are you sure?\" and the defendant replied, \"I'm not sure.\" The interrogator then asked, \"Why would you want to talk with a lawyer?\" and the defendant replied, \"Because I killed the clerk. It was an accident, and I think I need a lawyer to defend me.\" At that point all interrogation ceased. Later, the defendant was formally charged with murdering the clerk. The defendant has moved to suppress evidence of his statement \"I killed the clerk\" on the ground that this statement was elicited in violation of his Miranda rights. Should the defendant's motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because although the defendant effectively asserted the right to counsel, the question \"Why would you want to\ntalk with a lawyer?\" did not constitute custodial interrogation.\nB. No, because the defendant did not effectively assert the right to counsel, and his conduct prior to making the statement\nconstituted a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.\nC. Yes, because although the defendant did not effectively assert the right to counsel, his conduct prior to making the\nstatement did not constitute a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.\nD.

Arizona, specifically the requirements for effective waiver of Miranda rights and the distinction between custodial and non-custodial situations.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe defendant was given Miranda warnings and validly arrested for the murder of a store clerk. When an interrogator asked if he wanted to give up his Miranda rights and talk to them, the defendant responded affirmatively. He then made incriminating statements admitting to the murder and implicating himself in the crime. However, he later expressed uncertainty about continuing to talk to the interrogator and requested a lawyer.\n\n### Rule application\nFor a statement to be admissible, it must be given voluntarily, with knowledge of the nature and character of the statement and the consequences of making it. In a custodial situation, a valid waiver of Miranda rights requires knowingly, intelligent, and voluntary waivers. The defendant's request to talk to a lawyer, combined with his subsequent incriminating statements, does not constitute a valid waiver due to confusion or compulsion.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the defendant was in a custodial situation and his request to talk to a lawyer was not knowingly, intelligent, and voluntary, his incriminating statements must be excluded. Therefore, the correct verdict would be option D, ruling in favor of the defendant based on the admissibility of his statements under Miranda v.

Shortly thereafter, the prosecutor took the case to trial, calling the witness to testify before the jury. The prosecutor did not disclose the witness's prior perjury conviction until the defense was preparing to rest. Defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial, which the court denied.

The witness was later called to testify before the jury, and the prosecution did not disclose the conviction until after the defense had finished presenting its case. The defense was unable to properly impeach the witness due to the delay in disclosure.\n\n### Rule application\nThe United States Constitution guarantees every accused the right to a fair trial, which includes the disclosure of exculpatory evidence to the defense.

She managed to obtain some cyanide, a deadly poison. One evening, she poured wine laced with the cyanide into a glass, handed it to her husband, and proposed a loving toast. The husband was so pleased with the toast that he set the glass of wine down on a table, grabbed his wife, and kissed her passionately. After the kiss, the wife changed her mind about killing the husband. She hid the glass of wine behind a lamp on the table, planning to leave it for the maid to clean up. The husband did not drink the wine. The maid found the glass of wine while cleaning the next day. Rather than throw the wine away, the maid drank it.

The man agreed and accepted $25,000 as a down payment. Although the man intended to kill the competitor for money, the woman only intended to pay the man for the murder.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder unilateral conspiracy theory, two or more parties can form a conspiracy, even if only one party intends to commit the crime. The woman took a substantial step towards committing the murder by paying the man $25,000, satisfying the requisite mens rea for criminal liability.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the woman only needed to intend to pay the man for the murder of the competitor, and took a substantial step towards committing the crime, she would be guilty of conspiracy under unilateral conspiracy theory. Therefore, the correct verdict would be C, with a yes answer for the question 'Is the woman guilty of conspiracy to murder the business competitor?'.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landlord and a tenant orally agreed to a commercial tenancy for a term of six months beginning on July 1.

One day while the officer was on highway patrol, her radar gun clocked the man's car at 68 mph in an area where the maximum posted speed limit was 65 mph. The officer's usual practice was not to stop a car unless it was going at least 5 mph over the posted limit, but contrary to her usual practice, she decided to stop the man's car in the hope that she might discover evidence of drug dealing. After she stopped the car and announced that she would be writing a speeding ticket, the officer ordered the man and his passenger to step out of the car. When the passenger stepped out, the officer saw that the passenger had been sitting on a clear bag of what the officer immediately recognized as marijuana. The officer arrested both the man and the passenger for possession of marijuana. At their joint trial, the man and the passenger claim that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the officer improperly (1) stopped the car for speeding as a pretext for investigating a hunch rather than for the stated purpose of issuing a traffic ticket and (2) ordered the passenger to step out of the car even though there was no reason to believe that the passenger was a criminal or dangerous.

The businessman had stated at a press conference that no bribes had been offered or taken and that no laws of any kind had been broken. The grand jury issued a subpoena requiring the businessman to testify before it. The businessman moved to quash the subpoena on the ground that his testimony could tend to incriminate him. The prosecutor responded with a grant of use immunity (under which the businessman's compelled statements before the grand jury could not be used against him in any state or federal prosecution). The businessman responded that the grant of use immunity was not sufficient to protect his Fifth Amendment rights. Should the businessman be compelled to testify?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the businessman remains subject to the risk of foreign prosecution.\nB. No, because use immunity does not prevent the government from prosecuting the businessman on the bribery scheme.\nC.

The child had been playing with the woman's one-and-a-half-year-old son and had fallen against a lamp, which had knocked a lamp with a very short cord standing in the child's way and caused the cord to constrict her throat. The child's death could have resulted from no fault of the woman. A neighbor, however, said that the woman should have kept the lamp with a longer cord or should have removed it from use. As a result of this statement and the neighbor's other criticisms of the woman's behavior, the woman became very upset, and she drank all night at a bar. While driving home very drunk at 6 a.m., the woman struck and killed a pedestrian who was legally crossing the street.

The statement was made shortly after the incident, and the defendant expressed remorse for the harm caused to the plaintiff.\n\n### Rule application\nHearsay evidence is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Under the hearsay exception for present sense impressions, an original sense impression may be proved through another's description or state of mind. In this scenario, the defendant's statement describing her state of mind upon seeing the plaintiff's injury would fall under this exception.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the defendant's statement describes her current state of mind upon seeing the plaintiff's injury, it qualifies as a present sense impression. Therefore, the statement would be admissible as evidence under the exception for present sense impressions. The correct verdict would be option C, admissible as a present sense impression.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A landowner owned Blueacre, a valuable tract of land located in York County. The back half of Blueacre was subject to a longstanding easement in favor of a water company, which had an easement to enter Blueacre for inspection, maintenance, and repair of a water main that crossed the property. The water company had not used the easement for ten years. The water company filed suit to determine the scope of the easement. The owner of Blueacre appeared, testified, and told the jury that the water company had never used the easement for anything except inspections, and he expected that the water company would again so limit its use of the easement if the water company was successful in its suit. After the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury that it had to find defendant's version of the facts. The jury returned a verdict for the owner of Blueacre. The water company filed a motion for a new trial on the ground of unfairness in the jury instruction. Should the court grant the motion for a new trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner of Blueacre had testified that the water company had never used the easement for any purpose other than inspections.\nB.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

The victim has testified that he cannot remember who attacked him with the lead pipe. He would further testify that he remembers only that a passerby found him in the alley, and that he told the passerby that the defendant had hit him with the lead pipe; he then lost consciousness. The defendant objects to this proposed testimony, arguing that it is hearsay and that the victim had no personal knowledge of the identity of the perpetrator.

The vaporizer consisted of a gallon-size glass jar, which held water to be heated until it became steam, and a metal heating unit into which the jar fit. The jar was covered by a plastic cap with an opening to allow the steam to escape. At the time the vaporizer was manufactured and sold, there was no safer alternative design. The booklet that accompanied the vaporizer read: \"This product is safe, spillproof, and practically foolproof. It shuts off automatically when the water is gone.\" The booklet had a picture of a vaporizer sending steam over a baby's crib. The mother used the vaporizer whenever the child was suffering from congestion. She placed the vaporizer on the floor near the child's bed. One night, the child got out of bed to get a drink of water and tripped over the cord of the vaporizer as she crossed the room. The top of the vaporizer separated from the base, and boiling water from the jar spilled on the child when the vaporizer tipped over. The child suffered serious burns as a consequence. The child's representative brought an action for damages against the manufacturer of the vaporizer. The manufacturer moved to dismiss after the representative presented the evidence above. Should the manufacturer's motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a jury could find that the manufacturer expressly represented that the vaporizer was spillproof.\nB. No, because the vaporizer caused a serious injury to the child.\nC. Yes, because it should have been obvious to the mother that the water in the jar would become boiling hot.\nD.

The vaporizer lacked a spillproof feature and its jar contained boiling water that easily spilled.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder the defective design theory, a product is deemed unreasonably dangerous if it contains a defect that makes it likely to cause harm and there is no alternative design to make it safe. In this scenario, a jury could find that the vaporizer's lack of a spillproof feature and containment of boiling water made it likely to cause harm, and that a safer design with a spillproof feature would have prevented the injury.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that a child suffered serious burns due to a vaporizer's faulty design, the manufacturer should lose their motion to dismiss.

The warehouse was built to the lot lines on all four sides. On the street side, recessed loading docks permitted semi-trailers to be backed in. After the tractors were unhooked, the trailers extended into the street and occupied most of one lane of the street. Over the years, as trailers became larger, the blocking of the street became more severe. The municipality advised the seller that the loading docks could not continue to be used because the trailers blocked the street; it gave the seller 90 days to cease and desist. During the 90 days, the seller sold and conveyed Blackacre by warranty deed for a substantial consideration to a buyer. The problem of the loading docks was not discussed in the negotiations. Upon expiration of the 90 days, the municipality required the buyer to stop using the loading docks. This action substantially reduced the value of Blackacre.

Although the doctor should have concluded that the infant was totally deaf due to a hereditary condition, the doctor negligently concluded that the infant's hearing was normal. After the diagnosis, but before they learned that the infant was in fact deaf, the parents conceived a second child who also suffered total deafness due to the hereditary condition. The parents claim that they would not have conceived the second child had they known of the high probability of the hereditary condition. They have sought the advice of their attorney regarding which negligence action against the doctor is most likely to succeed. What sort of action against the doctor should the attorney recommend?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. A medical malpractice action seeking damages on the second child's behalf for expenses due to his deafness, on the\nground that the doctor's negligence caused him to be born deaf.\nB.

The parents conceived a second child who also suffered total deafness due to the same hereditary condition. They claim that they would not have conceived had they known of the high probability of the hereditary condition.\n\n### Rule application\nNegligence actions can be brought for wrongful birth, where a child is born with a condition that should have been detected through reasonable care. In this scenario, the parents can bring a wrongful birth action against the doctor seeking damages for expenses incurred due to the second child's deafness, given that the doctor's negligence led to conceiving the second child.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that a wrongful birth action is most relevant in this scenario, the correct verdict would be a wrongful birth action by the parents against the doctor, supporting option B. A wrongful life action, which seeks damages for the entire period of the child's life, is not applicable as it involves the decision to bring a child into the world despite a fatal condition.

This can be by intent, recklessness, or negligence. In this scenario, the child's intent or recklessness towards the neighbor is not in question; the relevant question is whether his conduct was negligent.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that a 6-year-old child is old enough to appreciate the riskiness of deliberately throwing himself against a frail elderly neighbor, he is likely to be negligent in doing so.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder.

When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA farmer who wanted to sell her land received a letter from a developer that stated, \"I will pay you $1,100 an acre for your land.\" The farmer's letter of reply stated, \"I accept your offer.\" Unbeknownst to the farmer, the developer had intended to offer only $1,000 per acre but had mistakenly typed \"$1,100.\" As both parties knew, comparable land in the vicinity had been selling at prices between $1,000 and $1,200 per acre.

Both parties knew that comparable land in the area was selling for prices between $1,000 and $1,200 per acre.\n\n### Rule application\nThe parol evidence rule allows courts to exclude evidence of prior agreements or statements to explain or modify the terms of a written contract. This rule is intended to promote the finality and certainty of written agreements. In this scenario, the applicable law allows the consideration of extrinsic evidence to modify the terms of the letter contract if the evidence is clear and unambiguous.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the letter agreement was not ambiguous and that the parties intended to sell the land at a price of $1,000 per acre, the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between the parties would be a contract formed at a price of $1,000 per acre. Therefore, the correct verdict would be option C, which states that there is a contract formed at a price of $1,000 per acre.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A landowner owned Blueacre, a tract of land, in fee simple.

On several past occasions, the buyer had taken a 5% discount from the contract price when paying within 10 days of delivery, and the seller had not objected. On this occasion, when the buyer took a 5% discount for paying within 10 days, the seller objected because his profit margin on this particular machine was smaller than on his other machines.

The dealer has claimed an entitlement to the insurance payment for the old car, and has offered evidence of prior negotiations between the parties regarding this claim.\n\n### Rule application\nThe parol evidence rule prevents evidence of prior negotiations from contradicting the terms of a written contract.

The mill delivered the proper quantity of flour in a timely manner for the first 15 weeks. However, the 16th delivery was tendered on a Tuesday, and amounted to only 800 pounds. The mill told the bakery that the 200-pound shortage would be made up on the delivery due the following Monday. The late delivery and the 200-pound shortage will not significantly disrupt the bakery's operations. How may the bakery legally respond to the nonconforming tender?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The mill promised to make up the shortage on the following Monday. The bakery's operations are not significantly disrupted by the late delivery and shortage.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder a contract for the regular delivery of goods, the bakery has the right to accept or reject any late delivery if the late delivery is not caused by the bakery's breach, and the late delivery is tendered not more than three days after the scheduled delivery date. In this scenario, the bakery can either accept the late delivery and deduct damages for any losses caused by the shortage, or reject the late delivery and give the mill an opportunity to cure by delivering the correct amount on the following Monday. Option C, which allows the bakery to accept the late delivery and specify conditions for the mill to cure the nonconformity, aligns with this rule.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven these options, the correct verdict would be option C, allowing the bakery to accept the late delivery with conditions for the mill to cure the nonconformity. This option gives the bakery some control over the remedy while also providing the mill with a chance to cure the breach.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A seller owned a single family house and a mobile home located near each other on a lot that was twice as long as it was wide. The seller had a long-standing oral contract to sell the two properties to a buyer. The seller recently notified the buyer that he had decided to sell the mobile home to a neighbor and asked the buyer whether he wanted the house or the mobile home. The buyer, who was then in another city, orally replied, \"I'll take the house.\" The seller said, \"Fine. We'll do the deal the same as we agreed to do the other deal.\" The buyer asked the seller how he was to get financing, and the seller said, \"I'll loan you the money.\" The seller and the buyer agreed by mutual assent to postpone the closing from its original date of September 15 to October 15 to give the buyer time to get financing.

            "explanation": "Because the contract authorizes the delivery of flour in separate lots to be separately accepted, the parties entered into an installment contract. UCC \u00a7 2-612 adopts a \"substantial impairment\" standard for determining whether a buyer can reject a particular installment or cancel the entire contract. A buyer can reject an installment if a nonconformity substantially impairs that installment and the nonconformity cannot be cured. Here the mill's tender of less than the contracted-for quantity did not amount to a nonconformity that substantially impaired either the value of the 16th installment or the whole contract. The mill's proposed cure, the delivery of the remaining 200 pounds on the following Monday, is sufficient given that the late delivery and the shortage will not significantly disrupt the bakery's business. Accordingly, the bakery must accept the delivery of the tendered 800 pounds of flour but may deduct from the price any damages for losses resulting from the late delivery.",
