The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

Where the company\u2019s major place of manufacturing is located.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Federal question jurisdiction extends to any case in which a well-pleaded complaint asserts a claim arising under federal law, even if the claim would normally be construed as being governed by state law. However, the federal court must have diversity jurisdiction or it cannot hear the case. Diversity jurisdiction exists when any claim asserts diversity between any of the parties and the state where the court is located. Therefore, the presence of diversity depends entirely on whether the claim shows diversity between any of the parties and the state where the court is located. Therefore, the location of the company\u2019s minimum contacts determines whether the court has diversity jurisdiction. Thus, the best answer is B. A is incorrect. The place where the company distributes its cars has nothing to do with diversity jurisdiction. The company\u2019s location for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is the state where the court is located. C is incorrect. The location of the company\u2019s headquarters has nothing to do with diversity jurisdiction. The company\u2019s location for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is the state where the court is located. D is incorrect. The location of the company\u2019s major place of manufacturing has nothing to do with diversity jurisdiction. The company\u2019s location for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is the state where the court is located.\n",

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The bank filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that its method of calculating interest, as described in the complaint, was proper under federal law and that the federal law preempted the depositor\u2019s state-law claim. The court granted the motion to dismiss the depositor\u2019s federal claim and reserved ruling on the motion to dismiss the state-law claim. After completing discovery, the bank has moved to dismiss the state-law claim for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The court may hear the state-law claim only if it is so related to a claim or dispute within a federal question jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy. Such a relationship exists here only if the depositor\u2019s contract claim is within federal banking law. Because the motion to dismiss the state-law claim is the first motion raised with regard to this federal banking law claim, the court must hear the state-law claim. B is incorrect.

Because the motion to dismiss the state-law claim is the first motion raised with regard to this federal banking law claim, the court must hear the state-law claim. C is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

The complaint asserted a $120,000 claim under state law. Fifty days after service of the complaint, the plaintiff amended the complaint, adding a second defendant, a citizen of State C. The amended complaint asserted the $120,000 state-law claim and a related federal-law claim against both defendants. Twenty-five days after service of the amended complaint, the second defendant removed the action to a federal court in State B with the first defendant\u2019s consent. Was removal proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the first defendant was a citizen of the forum state.\nB. No, because the notice of removal was untimely.\nC. Yes, because the amended complaint asserted a claim under federal law.\nD. Yes, because the parties met the requirements for diversity jurisdiction.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The first defendant's citizenship would not defeat federal diversity jurisdiction. The removal statute provides that any civil action over which the district courts would have original jurisdiction, might be removed by any defendant or defendants. Here, the district court would have had original jurisdiction because the state court had originally invoked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case based on a federal question (the state law claim gives the state court federal question jurisdiction over the plaintiff's suit, and the federal law claim now gives it diversity jurisdiction over the plaintiff's suit). B is incorrect. The ten-day deadline for filing a notice of removal begins running when the complaint is filed or served, whichever is later. The twenty-five day delay is a harmless error since the removal was timely. C is incorrect. It is the addition of the federal claim that gave the court diversity jurisdiction over the case; the first defendant's citizenship has nothing to do with diversity jurisdiction. D is correct. The removal statute provides that any civil action over which the district courts would have original jurisdiction, might be removed by any defendant or defendants. Here, the district court would have had original jurisdiction because the state court had originally invoked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case based on a federal question (the state law claim gives the state court federal question jurisdiction over the plaintiff's suit, and the federal law claim now gives it diversity jurisdiction over the plaintiff's suit).

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

The defendant travels to State A once each year for a weeklong vacation but has no other State A contacts. The defendant answered, denying all allegations. One week later, the defendant filed an amended answer, denying all allegations and including the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. State A has a long-arm statute that permits personal jurisdiction to the constitutional limit. The defendant has moved for an order dismissing the action based on the personal-jurisdiction challenge asserted in the amended answer. Should the court issue the order?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant waived the challenge to personal jurisdiction by failing to include it in her original answer.\nB.

The railroad is incorporated and has its principal place of business in State B and operates in States A and B. Several other passengers were also injured and have brought individual actions in State B federal court. The railroad has moved the State A federal court to transfer the action to the State B federal district court. State B has only one federal district. What is the railroad\u2019s best argument in support of the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The accident occurred in State B and many witnesses are located there.\nB. The action involves common questions of fact with similar actions pending in State B.\nC. The railroad is incorporated and has its principal place of business in State B.\nD. Venue is not proper in State A.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The strongest argument the railroad has is that the State A court would have centrality of events and evidence with the similar actions pending in State B, which is a stronger basis for joint jurisdiction than venue. A is incorrect. The fact that many witnesses may be located in State B does not necessarily mean that the State A court would have personal jurisdiction over those witnesses. And it would be improper to transfer the case to State B simply because venue cannot be met there. C is incorrect. Choice C is incorrect for two reasons. First, choice of law rules indicate that State A would apply State A law, meaning that choice of law rules would not apply the law of State B, where the railroad is incorporated and has its principal place of business. Second, State A law provides for diversity suit venue in the state where the district court is located, not where the court would have personal jurisdiction. Therefore, because State A law provides for venue in the state where the district court is located, and the railroad is incorporated in State B and has its principal place of business there, State A law would require that venue be in State A, not in State B. D is incorrect. It is not true that venue is not proper in State A. State A law provides for diversity suit venue in the state where the district court is located. Thus, because State A law provides for venue in the state where the district court is located, and the railroad is incorporated and has its principal place of business in State B, State A law would require that venue be in State A, not in State B.\n",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

After several members were arrested, the organization\u2019s leader called for \u201ceven bigger demonstrations next week to halt operations at the base.\u201d The US Attorney in the jurisdiction brought a federal civil action against the organization and its leader, seeking an injunction against protests that interfered with the base\u2019s operations. With the complaint, the US Attorney moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to \u201cenjoin any blockade of the base\u2019s entrance or other disruption of base activity until the court can hear motions for a preliminary and a permanent injunction.\u201d The US Attorney attached an affidavit certifying the unsuccessful efforts she had made to locate the organization and its leader and to notify them of the motion. The court immediately held a hearing and issued the TRO in a one-sentence order that did not describe the acts to be restrained but instead incorporated by reference the allegations of the complaint and the TRO motion. Did the court properly grant the TRO?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the order did not describe in reasonable detail the acts to be restrained.\nB. No, because the organization and its leader did not receive notice of the hearing.\nC. Yes, because damages would be inadequate to address the harm alleged in the complaint.\nD. Yes, because the planned demonstrations threatened imminent irreparable harm.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The rule requiring a description of the restraining order in reasonable detail is not applicable when the injunction is a TRO. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319 (1989). B is incorrect. The requirement for personal service is inapplicable to a TRO. See Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 333; Fed.R.Civ.P. 65. In addition, courts may grant a TRO in a proceeding where an initial hearing on the merits is set down for a later date, even if personal service of the initial process would be impracticable. C is incorrect. Damages may indeed be an adequate remedy to address the harm alleged in a complaint in the case of a permanent injunction. However, where the injunction is TRO, there is an imminent and irreparable harm, which outweighs even the potential harm of issuing a preliminary injunction against which there is no guarantee damages would be an adequate remedy. Such is the case even if the permanent injunction ultimately will be found to be invalid. D is correct. The mere fact that notice for a TRO may not be personal service does not mean that the court cannot issue the TRO. There is no jurisdictional defect in the fact that the court may issue a TRO without personal service, because the rule requiring personal service is inapplicable to a TRO. See Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 333; Fed.R.Civ.P. 65. In addition, courts may grant a TRO in a proceeding where an initial hearing on the merits is set down for a later date, even if personal service of the initial process would be impracticable.

In describing the events that led to the false accusations, the complaint quoted a statement of a competitor made to the employer about the worker\u2019s alleged theft. During discovery, the worker deposed the competitor. One week after discovery closed, the worker moved to amend the complaint to add the competitor as a defendant. The competitor opposed the motion on the ground that the statutory limitations period had expired. Is the court likely to grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery has closed, and the competitor will be prejudiced.\nB. No, because the amendment would not relate back and thus would be futile.\nC. Yes, because leave to amend should be freely granted when the underlying action was timely.\nD. Yes, because the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances and relate back to the allegations in the original complaint.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. Courts routinely allow motions to amend even after the statute of limitations has run, so long as the motion to amend is made within a reasonable time after the plaintiff discover the inadequacy of the original pleading. Here, it makes no difference that discovery has closed, because claims that were not known to the plaintiff and could not reasonably have been discovered until the conclusion of discovery would not trigger the conclusion of discovery rule. B is correct. Although the statute of limitations has run in these circumstances, the court may allow an amendment to the complaint, even after the limitation period has run, so long as the motion to amend is made within a reasonable time after the plaintiff discover the inadequacy of the original complaint. In this case, the facts supporting the claim against the competitor were available to the worker at the time of the filing of the original complaint, and so the worker did not timely file the suit against the competitor. But the conclusion of discovery rule does not apply here, because the facts that support the competitor's liability were known to the worker when the original complaint was filed. Accordingly, the worker's suit against the competitor was not time-barred when it was filed. Because the worker acted quickly to amend the complaint against the competitor, the court will likely grant leave to amend. C is incorrect. Here, the worker's suit against the competitor was not time-barred when it was filed because the worker's suit was timely under the applicable statute of limitations. As explained above, the limitations period did not begin to run until the worker discovered the inadequacy of the original complaint. Accordingly, the worker's suit was timely filed, so a court would grant the worker's motion to amend her complaint, even though the limitations period had run. D is incorrect. Under the relation back rule, claims can be added back to the complaint even after the limitations period has run so long as the added party was not aware of, and could not have been aware of, the pendency of the action before adding the new party. Here, the worker's motion to add the competitor as a defendant would be denied, because the worker knew of the competitor's accusations at the time she filed the original complaint. Thus, the relation back rule does not apply.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Courts may deny leave to amend when the claim to be added is futile. Here, the claim is futile on limitations grounds unless relation back applies. Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.",

The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA delivery driver backed her truck up to the loading dock of a large home improvement store. Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC. The court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law because he implicitly assumed the risk of the manager\u2019s carelessness.\nD. The court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law because no reasonable jury would find him less at fault than the manager.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The facts of this case indicate that the friend was very close to the truck and that he took no significant action that would raise him to sharing fault. In addition, it should be noted that because the friend was not the intended beneficiary of the rope and the padlock being secured, he should not be found to bear any negligence. Therefore, the friend's assumption of risk defense should fail. A is incorrect because it ignores the fact that the friend did not take any actions to bear fault. B is incorrect because the facts indicate that the friend should not bear any negligence and that he should not be found to bear assumption of risk. C is incorrect because the facts indicate that the friend did not take any actions that would bear his own negligence and that he should not be found to bear assumption of risk.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery.

The manufacturer timely demanded a jury trial, and the court informed the parties that it would seat a seven-person jury. The parties agreed to a non-unanimous jury verdict. The jury returned a verdict for the homeowner. The manufacturer asked the court to poll the jury, and the poll revealed a 4 to 3 vote in favor of the homeowner. The manufacturer objected to the verdict and has moved for a new trial. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny a new trial, because the manufacturer agreed to a non-unanimous verdict.\nB. Direct the jury to deliberate further until it can return a verdict supported by at least six jurors.\nC. Grant a new trial, because fewer than six jurors voted in favor of the homeowner.\nD. Grant a new trial, because the verdict was not unanimous.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The fact that a jury has returned a verdict that is not unanimous does not alone justify a new trial. The trial court may grant a new trial if the jury's verdict is not unanimous because of \"differences caused by inadequate instructions on the issues of liability, or because of bias or prejudice against a party.\" The parties' agreement to a non-unanimous verdict does not, standing alone, preclude the court from granting a new trial for a reason that would otherwise justify the award of a new trial. B is incorrect. There is no basis for this argument. The jury may render a verdict as to whom shall have what legal right or obligation, or upon what factual issue it shall find for one party or the other, by a unanimous decision if possible. If that is impossible, then by a decision by at least a majority vote. Thus, if the jury cannot come to a unanimous decision, then it must continue to deliberate until it can reach a verdict by a majority decision. C is incorrect. The fact that the jury's verdict was not unanimous does not itself warrant a new trial. A new trial may be granted for a number of reasons, but one of those reasons is not the absence of a unanimous verdict. D is correct.

The governor was then placed in a federal lockup facility. A state judge has issued a writ of habeas corpus against the director of the lockup facility on the ground that the federal law in question violates the Tenth Amendment. Is the writ valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because only federal courts can issue habeas writs for individuals in federal custody.\nB. No, because the arrest was made pursuant to a warrant.\nC. Yes, because state sovereignty shields the governor from federal coercion.\nD. Yes, because the Constitution guarantees the availability of habeas corpus.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The writ of habeas corpus, which allows a prisoner to challenge his or her confinement and to obtain release unless the state has legal grounds to keep the person in custody, is a federal writ. Therefore, any state court habeas action would be an invalidity interference with the federal judicial power. B is incorrect. The writ of habeas corpus is not limited to situations where the individual is actually in the custody of the federal government. Instead, the writ is a means by which the prisoner can challenge his or her confinement and obtain release if the state doesn't have legal grounds to keep the person in custody. In this case, because the governor was placed in a federal lockup facility, he is already in the custody of the federal government and could bring a habeas action in federal court. C is incorrect. While this argument could be made if the governor were held by the federal government in a facility that had not been used for the purposes of federal custody, it would not apply where, as here, the governor was placed in a federal lockup facility. D is incorrect. While the Constitution does provide for the writ of habeas corpus, it does not limit the writ to federal courts. Instead, the Constitution provides that habeas corpus shall be granted when it is necessary to provide relief from unlawful custody.\n",

The company that submitted the lowest bid sued the federal agency in federal district court. The only relief that the company sought was to enjoin the issuance of a contract to the prevailing bidder.

An appropriations statute directs that $300 million be spent on planting wildflowers along public highways. Considering the statute to be a waste of money, the President has announced two decisions. First, he will spend half of the money to train troops. Second, he will retain the remaining funds in the federal treasury and not spend them at all. Are the President\u2019s decisions constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both decisions are constitutional.\nB. Only the decision to spend the funds to train troops is constitutional.\nC. Only the decision to retain the remaining funds is constitutional.\nD. Neither decision is constitutional.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The President may exercise some executive power with the consent of Congress, but Congress may terminate the President's tenure at any time. Thus, as a general rule, congressional funding of the President's power to execute the laws is constitutional, whereas termination or diversion of funds appropriated for other purposes is not. Because the appropriations statute provides that the $300 million shall be spent planting wildflowers along public highways, this spending of funds is a use of the power to execute the laws and thus is within the President's power to execute the laws. However, the President's second decision, to retain the remaining $150 million, is a termination and diversion of funds appropriated for another purpose and thus is not constitutional. A is incorrect. The first decision to spend the other half of the funds to train troops is within the power of the President to execute the laws. Therefore, it is constitutional. However, the second decision of the President is a termination and diversion of funds appropriated for another purpose, and is thus not constitutional. C is incorrect. Naming specific purposes for which funds shall be spent does not terminate the discretion of the President to execute the laws to some degree. Rather, this is an exercise of congressional power to spend. D is incorrect. Neither of the President's decisions impacts the use of funds that have been appropriated by Congress. Instead, they are exercises of the power of Congress to spend funds. Thus, the decisions are constitutional.\n",

No, because neither a carrier\u2019s registration nor its payment of a nominal fee is necessary to facilitate the application of state laws to motor carriers.\nB. No, because the requirements impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the requirements apply equally to interstate and intrastate carriers and are the only prerequisites to the issuance of the permit.\nD. Yes, because the requirements are the least restrictive means of serving the state\u2019s compelling interest in highway safety.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. Under the Commerce Clause, the state may regulate wholly interstate carriers so long as the regulation has a legitimate regulatory goal and does not unduly burden interstate commerce. However, a requirement that a carrier register and pay a fee with the state in order to be allowed to continue to engage in interstate commerce is not a legitimate exercise of that regulatory power. Such a requirement is beyond the scope of state regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause. The rule of ejusdem generis applies to the choice of the word \"carriers\" in this fact pattern, and limiting the provision to \"motor carriers\" would limit the application of this provision to carriers using highways. Therefore, the requirement that the motor carriers register and pay a fee would also be outside the scope of state regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause. B is incorrect. Although the state could probably require intrastate carriers to register and pay a fee, the state could not require wholly interstate carriers to register and pay a fee because this is beyond the scope of state regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause. C is incorrect. The requirements are not the only prerequisites to the issuance of a permit. The permit can be issued only after the carriers register and pay the required fee. D is incorrect. The requirements are not the least restrictive means of serving the state\u2019s compelling interest in highway safety. States may certainly regulate wholly interstate carriers so long as the regulation is rationally related to a legitimate state interest and does not unduly burden interstate commerce. However, requiring wholly interstate carriers to register and pay a fee is beyond the scope of state regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

A is the best answer among these four. B is incorrect. The law satisfies the substantial relation test of intermediate scrutiny only if the state can prove that the requirement is substantially related to a compelling state interest.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect.

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect.

The purchase order stated: \u201cIn the event of a breach, the retailer may pursue all remedies available to it under the UCC.\u201d The manufacturer received the purchase order and promptly shipped the laptops to the retailer. The manufacturer sent an acknowledgment form to the retailer four days later. Two days after accepting delivery of the laptops, the retailer received the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment form, which excluded consequential damages. The same day, the retailer discovered that the laptops were defective. If the retailer sues the manufacturer for breach of contract, will the retailer be entitled to pursue a claim for consequential damages?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the retailer and the manufacturer did not enter into a contract.\nB. No, because a contract was created that included the manufacturer\u2019s term excluding consequential damages.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops constituted an acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer.\nD. Yes, because terms supplied by the UCC will govern the contract formed by the conduct of the parties.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The retailer\u2019s attempt to limit the manufacturer to consequential damages in the acknowledgment amounted to an offer that the manufacturer accepted by shipping the laptops. Thus a contract was formed. The question states that the manufacturer sent an acknowledgment form to the retailer four days later. The acknowledgment term excluding consequential damages (as required by UCC \u00a7 2-206(3)) appearing on the manufacturer\u2019s form was a material term in the offer and thus became a term of the contract. Although the retailer did not agree to this term, the manufacturer\u2019s shipment was an acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer. Because the manufacturer\u2019s term excluding consequential damages was a material term and the manufacturer\u2019s shipment was an acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer rather than an additional requirement, the contract is governed by that term. Therefore, B is correct. A is incorrect. The contract called for consequential damages. Thus it was not a unilateral or implied-in-fact contract. C is incorrect. The offer that the manufacturer accepted was the retailer\u2019s purchase order, not the acknowledgment form. Accordingly, the terms of the manufacturer\u2019s form did not become part of the contract unless they were accepted by the retailer. They were not accepted by the retailer, so they did not form part of the contract. Moreover, under UCC \u00a7 2-205(1), the manufacturer\u2019s form was not a proper acceptance form. D is incorrect. The UCC will govern only if the contract was silent on a particular issue or the parties did not otherwise agree. Because the retailer\u2019s purchase order contained a provision limiting damages to consequential damages, the issue of consequential damages was a matter agreed to by the parties. Thus the UCC will not govern.\n",

The manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops was a reasonable mode of acceptance and gave rise to a contract. Answer B is incorrect.

On numerous occasions, the wife\u2019s brother had offered to buy the farm from her, but she had always refused. The husband died suddenly in an accident. The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children. What would be the wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Duress.\nB. Mistake.\nC. Unconscionability.\nD. Undue influence.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of undue influence where there is a great difference in bargaining power between the parties, where the parties are related, and where the party who is exerting influence receives a benefit. The facts support D. The brother and his attorney clearly had a great difference in bargaining power. In addition, the brother was offering to buy an asset that the wife had inherited from her father, and he was promising to pay the farm's fair market value. The brother was also related to the wife, which is an additional factor that may support a finding of undue influence. Finally, by getting the wife to sign the contract, the brother received the wife's promise to sell him the farm. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect. Duress is a threat of force that prevents someone from contracting in a manner that is not voluntary. In order for a threat to be effective enough to constitute duress, there must be a substantial risk that the threat will be carried out. The brother's statement that the wife would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children was a threat of force, but it was not duress. Although it might have coerced someone into signing a contract, the threat was not carried out, and it was not sufficient to constitute duress. B is incorrect. Mistake of fact will only be available as a defense if the mistake relates to a basic assumption of the contract and has a material effect on the exchange. In this case, the wife did not make a mistake regarding the basic assumption of the contract, which was that she did not need to sell the farm to support her children. Her mistake was a factual one, but it did not have a material effect on the exchange because she owned the farm, her children were not going to be deprived of anything by the sale, and she was not under any time pressure to sell the farm. C is incorrect. Unconscionability is the other possible defense. But the contract was not unconscionable. The contract was not substantially different than the value of what was traded for it, and it was not excessively oppressive.\n",

The parties negotiated and have agreed to all aspects of the employment except for the executive\u2019s salary, on which they remain several thousand dollars apart. The executive has sent a signed letter to the firm confirming the terms to which the parties have orally agreed while acknowledging that the salary has yet to be set. The firm has not responded to the confirmation letter. Do the parties now have an enforceable contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because an agreement for lifetime employment is subject to the statute of frauds, and the confirmation letter fails to satisfy the statute.\nB. No, because the agreement is too indefinite to be enforced.\nC. Yes, because the agreement is not subject to the statute of frauds, and the parties must negotiate the executive\u2019s salary in good faith.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. the statute of frauds does not apply because the executive's lifetime employment is a gratuitous (as opposed to a present) promise, and the statute of frauds does not apply to such promises. The issue is whether the letter satisfies the statute of frauds. The letter is a signed writing that not only satisfies the statute of frauds but also was sent in response to the oral agreement. Accordingly, the letter not only satisfies the statute of frauds but also memorializes the agreement that the parties made. B is incorrect. an agreement need not be in writing or otherwise memorialized to be enforceable. C is incorrect. the statute of frauds does apply to the agreement because it is an agreement for lifetime employment and not a gratuitous promise.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The doctrine of mutual mistake allows a party to avoid his or her contractual obligation if the parties entered into a contract that is not the product of a meeting of the minds. However, if a party's mistake relates to a fact that is not necessary to the interpretation of the contract, that party may not avoid the contract. In this case, the landowner and contractor entered into a contract that was not the product of a meeting of the minds. When drafting the contract, the landowner inadvertently omitted the price-escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber from the written agreement. Because the amount of lumber needed for the construction was not necessary to the interpretation of the written contract, the contractor may not avoid the contract due to mutual mistake. Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect. Mistake of law, whether it relates to a fact that is or is not necessary to the interpretation of the contract, does not allow a party to avoid his or her contractual obligation. In addition, avoidance of the contract is not the contractor's only remedy. The contractor can recover damages or the reasonable expectation of the contract price when he completed in accordance with the terms of the contract. B is incorrect. The parol evidence rule will not bar introduction of evidence of the oral agreement relating to the price of lumber. C is incorrect. The doctrine of reformation is not available to cure a mistake. Reformation is an equitable remedy that allows a court to reform a contract that is alleged to be different from the understanding of the parties at the time they entered into the contract.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

The firm\u2019s bid included a subcontractor\u2019s bid to complete the electrical work on the plant for $100,000. The municipality awarded the construction contract to the firm. Later that day, before the firm told the subcontractor of the award, the subcontractor told the firm that it was withdrawing its bid because it had recently undertaken a new project that would absorb all its capacity for the next 18 months. The firm nevertheless accepted the subcontractor\u2019s bid and demanded that it perform the electrical work on the plant, but the subcontractor refused. The firm had to hire another subcontractor to perform the electrical work, at a cost of $115,000. The firm completed the construction of the plant at a profit. Which of the following statements correctly describes the firm\u2019s legal rights, if any, against the first subcontractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The firm is entitled to recover nominal damages only, because it completed the construction at a profit.\nB. The firm is entitled to recover reliance damages, because it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid when it submitted its own bid to the municipality.\nC. The firm is entitled to recover expectation damages, because the first subcontractor\u2019s bid was irrevocable for a reasonable time and the firm timely accepted it.\nD. The firm has no rights against the first subcontractor, because the first subcontractor was free to revoke its bid at any time before the firm accepted that bid.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Under the UCC, a bid is invitation to accept an offer, which is either accepted by awarding the contract or rejected by the bidder's nonacceptance. The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid was a timely revocation of its offer, and the firm was free to reject it or wait to see if the subcontractor would accept. The subcontractor, however, never accepted. Therefore, the subcontractor had no obligation to perform and the firm has no cause of action against the subcontractor. A is incorrect. The subcontractor's bid was invitation to treat, and acceptance of that invitation would create an option contract. If the firm accepted the bid and performed its part of the contract, it would have a valid option contract and be entitled to recover damages for the subcontractor's breach. B is incorrect. An option contract may be created by an offer (the subcontractor's bid) and an acceptance (the firm's acceptance of the bid), but it is not enforceable unless the acceptor detrimentally relied on the promise before the promisor revoked the offer. C is incorrect. The subcontractor's bid was invitation to treat, and its acceptance would create an option contract. Under the UCC, an offeree cannot accept an option contract until the offer has been accepted. The subcontractor therefore could not accept its own bid and had not entered into a contract with the firm even if the firm had accepted.\n",

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

The man submitted to a lender a loan application that included a then-accurate statement of his financial condition. The lender reviewed the application and concluded that the man was creditworthy without verifying any of his information. A week after the man submitted his application, however, his financial condition changed significantly for the worse. The man did not report this change to the lender.

No, because the lender failed to independently assess the man\u2019s financial condition before signing the loan agreement.\nB. No, because the man did not affirmatively misrepresent his financial condition at any time.\nC. Yes, because the man concealed the change in his financial condition.\nD.

The lender does not have the right to rescind the contract because the man did not affirmatively misrepresent his financial condition. A lender is entitled to rely on the accuracy of information provided in a loan application if the lender has a reasonable basis for believing the information to be accurate. The facts suggest that the lender reviewed the application, relied on it, and determined that the man was creditworthy. Because the man\u2019s application did not contain an affirmative misrepresentation, the lender is not entitled to get out of the contract. A is incorrect. The lender relied on the accuracy of the information provided in the loan application and thus is not entitled to get out of the contract based on an erroneous view of the state of facts that existed at the time the contract was made. C is incorrect. There is no implied duty to disclose change in facts because the contract does not create a duty of disclosure at all. The contract is a unilateral one; the man did not make any statements of fact that were relied upon by the lender in entering into the contract. D is incorrect.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The parties\u2019 failure to put the oral provision reducing the rate for excess hours in the written contract does not make the contract void. The parol evidence rule does not bar evidence of a prior agreement that duplicates an agreement made part of the contract by a mistake or for any other reason. The prior agreement may be adopted by an amendment to the contract, and the amendment will be given effect when the writing is approved by both parties. Moreover, a unilateral modification of a contract\u2014such as the oral promise by the company to provide the services for $125 per hour in the case of services in excess of 100 hours\u2014does not violate the statute of frauds, since the writing (the contract) existed at the time the alleged unilateral modification was made. B is correct. The parties\u2019 written contract is indefinite with respect to the rate to be charged for the company\u2019s services in excess of 100 hours. However, the parol evidence rule permits evidence of the parties\u2019 oral agreement that the company would be entitled to a lower rate for services in excess of 100 hours. C is incorrect. The remedies available under the contract (such as specific performance) are for the company\u2019s services of 100 hours or less, not for its services in excess of 100 hours. Accordingly, the contract does not provide a rate of pay for the company\u2019s services in excess of 100 hours. D is incorrect.

The daughter is in breach of contract because the neighbor was named in a written direction from the father. The remedy sought by the neighbor, however, is a substantial performance claim. Because the daughter has physically removed the father from the stream of commerce, the neighbor will likely not prevail. A is incorrect. The father did have a right to modify the contract, but he was required to get the daughter's consent to do so. Here, the father gave the neighbor consent to the modification. B is a better answer than C. C is incorrect. The father had a transferable interest in the promise his daughter made to him, but he was free to assign that interest to the neighbor. Because the father had given the neighbor permission to modify the agreement, the neighbor's right to the $300,000 upon the father's death was enforceable even if the daughter objected. In any event, the modification that the father made was to the neighbor, not to the daughter, so the father had no interest that the daughter could have kept. D is incorrect. The father's modification of the agreement was enforceable because it was made in good faith, not for the purpose of avoiding an existing obligation. The modification was not enforceable because the father was seeking to change the beneficiary of the promise, not the amount or conditions of performance.\n",

One of the notices on the site announced that the furnishings in a home at a specified address were free for the taking. Within a few hours of the posting, all the furnishings had been taken. The notice had been placed by the homeowner\u2019s cousin without the homeowner\u2019s knowledge. The cousin bore a grudge against the homeowner and had placed the notice while the homeowner was away and had left the door to the home unlocked. In a negligence action brought by the homeowner against the company, what will be the company\u2019s strongest defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The company had no duty to the homeowner.\nB.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect.

The motorcycle hit a tire that had fallen off a truck driven by a delivery company employee who was making a delivery to an address on the private road. The boy was injured when his motorcycle went out of control after striking the tire. In a negligence action brought on behalf of the boy against the delivery company, the company contends that the boy was contributorily negligent and that his damages, if any, should be reduced in conformance with the jurisdiction\u2019s comparative negligence statute. The boy argues that his conduct should be judged according to the standard of a reasonable child of like age, intelligence, and experience under the circumstances. Is the boy entitled to be judged according to the standard of care that he has argued for?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the boy was driving a motorcycle.\nB.

The fact that the boy was trespassing on the private road has no bearing on the determination of the standard of care applicable to the boy. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. C is correct.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB. No, because the former employee could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts.\nC.

By interfering with the established cemetery\u2019s sending out the cards informing its customers of their right to cancel without penalty and by enticing those customers away, the former employee acted with malice intent to cause damage to the established cemetery\u2019s property, its contracts with its customers. The court should deny the former employee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. A is incorrect. The established cemetery\u2019s cards might have been interpreted as indicating that the cemetery had authorized its customers to cancel without penalty. The established cemetery might even be found liable, but only for inducing a breach of contract, which is not a tort. C is incorrect. The established cemetery\u2019s contracts were terminable by the purchasers, and the statute eliminated only the penalty that the established cemetery could impose. D is incorrect. The former employee did not directly interfere with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts; rather, he interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s customers.

The man was hit by a bullet and seriously injured. The man sued the customer, the owner of the range, and the manufacturer of the signaling apparatus. The jurisdiction prohibits a plaintiff from recovering against a defendant whose fault is less than or equal to that of the plaintiff.

The man will be able to recover 25% of his damages from each defendant.\nB. The man will be able to recover 25% of his damages from the customer but nothing from the owner or the manufacturer.\nC. The man will be able to recover 75% of his damages from any defendant.\nD. The man will not be able to recover damages.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The rule against contributory negligence allows a plaintiff to recover when his fault does not exceed that of the defendant. In this case, because each party was equally at fault, the man's ability to recover depends upon whether he is the dominant cause of his own harm. Because each party is 25% responsible, the man must be the dominant cause among the three defendants or he will not be able to recover against any of them. Here, the man was actively using a dangerous machine and was injured because of that use. Therefore the man is the dominant cause among the three defendants, and his damages will be apportioned such that the customer is held the dominant cause and the man recovers 25% of his damages from the customer. B is correct. Because each defendant is 25% responsible, the man's ability to recover damages depends on whether he is the dominant cause of his injury among the three defendants. Although the man is also at fault, he is the dominant cause of his injury with regard to the owner and manufacturer, because they are not the proximate cause of his injury. Because the customer was the proximate cause of his injury, however, the man is not the dominant cause among the customer, and he recovers 25% of his damages from the customer. Because the man is not the dominant cause with regard to the owner and manufacturer, he is not entitled to recover against them. C is incorrect. The fact that the man can recover 75% of his damages from any defendant does not mean that the man is the dominant cause among the defendants. The man's ability to recover damages from any defendant depends upon whether he is the dominant cause of his injury among the three defendants. Although the man is 25% responsible, he is the dominant cause of his injury among the three defendants because the customer was the proximate cause of his injury. D is incorrect. The fact that the man will not be able to recover from any defendant does not mean that the other party is the dominant cause. The man's inability to recover from any defendant depends upon whether he is the dominant cause of his injury among the three defendants.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA doctor ordered chest X-rays for a patient who smoked cigarettes. After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC. Yes, because punitive damages awards are not authorized unless there is proof of willful or wanton misconduct on the defendant\u2019s part.\nD. Yes, because the patient smoked cigarettes and therefore was contributorily negligent.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. A court will not automatically reverse a punitive damages award simply because it is exorbitant. Instead, a court will consider several factors in determining whether an award is exorbitant, including the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a 1 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process. In this case, however, a 7 to 1 ratio does not violate the Constitution. B is incorrect. Although a jury could find medical malpractice, resulting in death or serious injury, sufficient to support an award of punitive damages, the malpractice need not be willful or wanton. Moreover, the fact that the malpractice resulted in death or serious injury does not mean that the punitive damages award will be automatic. Here, the court will consider the appropriate standards for assessing the propriety of a punitive damages award. C is incorrect. The fact that the patient smoked cigarettes does not prove that the patient was contributorily negligent. Contributory negligence is a tacit admission that the plaintiff failed to use due care, and it bars recovery. The patient could validly sue for damages based on the radiologist\u2019s negligent misdiagnosis. D is incorrect. The fact that the patient smoked cigarettes does not prove that the patient was contributorily negligent. Contributory negligence is a tacit admission that the plaintiff failed to use due care, and it bars recovery. The patient could validly sue for damages based on the radiologist\u2019s negligent misdiagnosis.\n",

An employee of the agency went to the buyer\u2019s home and knocked on the front door. When the buyer answered, the employee explained that he was there to repossess the car and asked for the car keys. The buyer handed the employee the keys but then asked the employee to allow her to retrieve her laptop computer from the car. The employee declined the request, explaining to the buyer that any possessions in the car could be reclaimed from the company after the car was repossessed. After pleading unsuccessfully with the employee, the buyer shoved the employee away from the door with such force that the employee fell and suffered a broken wrist. The buyer then ran to the car, which was unlocked, and retrieved the laptop. The employee has sued the buyer for battery. The buyer has moved for summary judgment, arguing that she was privileged to act as she did. Should the trial court grant the buyer\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a fact-finder could reasonably conclude that the buyer used excessive force in attempting to defend her property.\nB. No, because after the buyer handed the keys to the employee, the car was no longer her property.\nC. Yes, because a possessor can use nonlethal force to protect his or her property.\nD. Yes, because the buyer complied with the law by returning the car keys and acted reasonably in asking to retrieve the laptop.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The buyer intentionally used force intentionally aimed at, and with the purpose or intent of causing injury to, the employee\u2019s person. The buyer could have avoided the injury to the employee by simply asking the employee to leave, and therefore should have known that her actions would create a substantial risk of bodily harm. The buyer pushed the employee hard enough and with sufficient intent to cause bodily harm. The buyer should not be granted summary judgment because she is not privileged to batter the employee. B is incorrect. The car once belonged to the buyer and she still had some interest and right in the vehicle. Therefore the employee, in his agent capacity, had no right to simply take the car without the buyer's permission. The employee\u2019s action in taking the car without the buyer's permission was sufficient to break any privilege that he might otherwise have had. C is incorrect. The buyer's action in pushing the employee was done in the defense of her property and, although nonlethal, was done with the intent to cause bodily harm. The buyer\u2019s privilege to use force, whether non-deadly or deadly, to protect her property would be deemed privileged, so answer D is incorrect.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The buyer intentionally shoved the employee, which satisfies the prima facie case for battery. As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

Frightened, a passenger pried the inside doors open and impulsively stuck his arm through them to try to stop the fall. As a result, his arm was broken. The elevator eventually stopped without causing further injuries. In a negligence action brought by the injured passenger against the company that installed and maintained the elevator, the injured passenger has asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that it may find the company negligent on a theory of res ipsa loquitur. In response, the company has argued that the passenger\u2019s conduct caused his injuries. How should the judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Res ipsa loquitur (\"the thing speaks for itself\") is a rebuttable presumption that allows a plaintiff to avoid having to prove the defendant was negligent. The doctrine applies only where (1) the plaintiff has suffered injury as a result of (2) possible negligence of the defendant and (3) it is unlikely that the plaintiff would have been responsible for the injury. The burden of persuasion in a case in which res ipsa loquitur is raised as an issue is on the defendant, and the court must instruct on the doctrine if the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of res ipsa. A is incorrect because the company cannot prove that the passenger\u2019s own negligence caused his injury. B is incorrect because the jury may, but is not required to, find that the passenger contributed to his injuries. The jury should be instructed to consider any negligence on the passenger\u2019s part if the jury finds that the company is liable. D is incorrect because the fact that the passenger acted reasonably under the circumstances does not negate the applicability of the res ipsa doctrine.\n",

As a result, the woman suffered great mental anguish, was unable to sleep, and ultimately suffered serious health consequences. Which of the following conclusions would best support a claim by the woman against the debt collector for intentional infliction of emotional distress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The debt collector could reasonably have foreseen that the calls and threats might cause harm to the woman\u2019s health.\nB. The debt collector\u2019s conduct caused the woman to fear that he was someday going to physically attack her.\nC. The debt collector\u2019s conduct failed to comply with industry custom.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The woman can sue the debt collector for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). A claim for IIED will succeed, at common law, when the defendant\u2019s intentional tortious conduct causes the plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress of a significant magnitude. The debt collector\u2019s actions qualify as a severe emotional distress-inducing intentional tort because they caused the woman to suffer great mental anguish and ultimately suffer serious health consequences. However, a claim for IIED will not succeed if the defendant\u2019s conduct was not extreme and outrageous. Here, the debt collector\u2019s actions were extreme and outrageous, so a claim for IIED will lie. A is incorrect because whether the debt collector could reasonably foresee that his actions would cause harm is a question for a negligence claim, not an IIED claim. Similarly, a claim for IIED will not succeed if the conduct simply falls short of what the average member of the community, by virtue of his or her mental faculties and visual and audio senses, would find highly offensive. Here, the debt collector\u2019s conduct caused the woman to fear that he was going to physically attack her; thus, C is incorrect. D is incorrect because a claim for IIED will succeed, at common law, when the defendant\u2019s intentional tortious conduct causes the plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress of a significant magnitude.\n",

A conclusion that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous, combined with the fact that the woman experienced severe emotional distress and the fact that the debt collector was probably at least reckless with respect to the risk of causing her distress, will provide the woman with a plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman\u2019s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.   Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. Answer C is incorrect. A mere failure to comply with industry custom does not establish any of the elements of IIED.",

Therefore, the spectator likely can obtain summary judgment on an abnormally dangerous activity theory. B is incorrect because a battery requires intentional harmful or offensive contact, which is not present here. C is incorrect because the amusement park was not committing an ultra-hazardous act that resulted to a extreme degree in the spectator\u2019s injury, thereby creating a non-delegable duty on the part of the spectator to prevent his own injury.

Answer B is incorrect. The spectator was injured in an accident: the amusement park did not intend to touch the spectator in a harmful or offensive manner, as is required for battery liability.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC. It is not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in places that are visible to neighbors.\nD. Unsightly conditions ordinarily do not of themselves amount to an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of a neighboring property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Private nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with another's use or enjoyment of property. Unsightliness alone does not constitute an interference that is substantial or unreasonable unless the unsightliness causes serious emotional distress or physically discomforts or harmfully affects the plaintiff's property. The facts indicate that the farmer's refusal to move the items has not physically encroached on the homeowner's land, and there is no indication that the items cause serious emotional distress or physically discomfort or harm the homeowner. Nonetheless, the homeowner's payment for an appraisal indicates that the items have caused an attenuated interference, which is sufficient for a nuisance. A is incorrect because the decrease in the market value of the homeowner's property is not a requirement for nuisance liability. B is incorrect because the mere fact that the farmer's items do not physically encroach on the homeowner's land does not mean that the farmer cannot be liable for nuisance. C is incorrect because the fact that it is common for farmers to keep old equipment in unsightly places in an area does not excuse the farmer from being responsible for his or her own actions.\n",

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The evidence is admissible under both the crime-motive and the consciousness-of-guilt theories. To establish a conspiracy charge, the government must prove that the defendant agreed with a co-conspirator to commit the crime and that the defendant aided and abetted the conspiracy. Evidence that the defendant purchased an airline ticket using an alias is relevant to show that the defendant was attempting to conceal his identity, which is consistent with a guilty conspiratorial agreement. It is also relevant to show that the defendant had a motive to possess cocaine, which can be taken as evidence that the defendant was the one planning to distribute it. Thus, B is correct. A is incorrect. Under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Here, the fact that the defendant purchased an airline ticket using an alias simply shows that the defendant is a person who occasionally travels internationally, which is not a fact \"of consequence\" to the conspiracy charge. Thus, under Rule 401, the evidence is inadmissible. C is incorrect. Although evidence that the defendant purchased an airline ticket using an alias is relevant to show that the defendant was trying to conceal his identity, it is not sufficient to prove that the defendant was aware of his guilt for the purposes of the \"consciousness of guilt\" theory. To prove conspiracy, the government must prove that the defendant agreed to the crime with a co-conspirator; mere knowledge of the crime is not enough. Thus, C is incorrect. D is incorrect. Although evidence that the defendant purchased an airline ticket using an alias is relevant to show that the defendant was trying to conceal his identity, it is not sufficient to prove that the defendant had a motive to possess cocaine for the purposes of the \"motive\" theory. To establish a conspiracy charge, the government must prove that the defendant agreed with a co-conspirator to commit the crime; evidence that the defendant purchased an airline ticket using an alias is irrelevant to this issue.

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease.

These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. This is a hybrid question, combining aspects of both the lay and expert opinion standard. In response to a claim that a product caused a plaintiff\u2019s injury, the plaintiff must establish that the plaintiff was exposed to the product and that the exposure caused the injury. The plaintiff\u2019s witness in this case has been qualified as an expert and is testifying that the plaintiff was exposed to the product. As a layperson, the plaintiff would be able to establish that exposure to the product occurred and that it caused the injury. Thus, the admissibility of the witness\u2019s testimony is governed by the standard for expert opinion. The witness\u2019s testimony argues that certain research studies support her conclusion that exposure to the product caused the injury. In order for the witness to testify to the support for her opinion, the party seeking to introduce the evidence must provide a summary to each party of the bases of the expert's opinion, and allow them an opportunity to examine the expert on the basis of those opinions. In this case, the studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney on which the witness relied on in forming her opinion are the summaries she was required to provide. B is incorrect because it is the homeowner\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of licensees on her property. C is incorrect because the contractor was negligent in his loosening of the boards without posting a warning. D is incorrect because the homeowner was negligent in insisting on the removal of the boards without warning of the danger.\n",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The statements in the letter are an admission of a party-opponent, the man, and they are being offered to prove the man\u2019s liability. The letter contains a statement of a party-opponent on a matter of consequence in an existing or reasonably anticipated civil action, and, though the statement may be hearsay, it is admissible as an admission by a party opponent. No hearsay exception is required because the statement is not being offered for its truth. A is incorrect. The best evidence rule requires production of the original, or a duplicate, of the letter to prove its contents only when the contents are disputed. If the contents of a letter are not disputed, its contents may be proven by having the writer of the letter testify to what was written. B is incorrect. The contents of the letter can be proved by the testimony of the writer of the letter, without producing the original letter itself. If the contents of the letter are not disputed, its contents may be proven by having the writer of the letter testify to what was written. C is incorrect. The statement is not being offered for its truth, so it is not hearsay. The man is in effect saying, \"I think that the woman is a thief,\" which is an admission that the woman lacks character for truthfulness and that the man intends to rely on that lack of character in his defense against the woman\u2019s claim.

Under the best evidence rule, the woman cannot testify to the contents of the letter unless the original is lost and did not become so by her in bad faith. See FRE 1004(a).

The photograph shows the plaintiff lying on the sidewalk, bleeding from a gash on her head, with a spilled paint can nearby. Is the photograph admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The photograph depicts the plaintiff's injury as severe and gruesome. Non-experts are prone to form a judgment about the severity of the plaintiff's injuries before hearing testimony about how the plaintiff was injured. The probative value of the photograph is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. B is incorrect. The testimony of the witness, who took the photograph, will establish that the photograph accurately depicts what he saw. The witness's testimony will be sufficient to authenticate the photograph. C is incorrect. Although the witness's testimony will establish the photograph's authenticity, it will not establish the content of the photograph. The witness can testify that the plaintiff was injured and that the paint can was there, but he cannot testify about what was left out of the photograph, such as the bystanders, ambulance, and so forth. Only the artist who created the photograph can testify to what was left out. D is incorrect. The self-authenticating property of the photograph does not extend to the specific facts depicted in the photograph.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect.

His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue. Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 701, property owners are entitled to express opinions on the value of their property, but here the stockholder is expressing an opinion on the cause of the publicly traded stock\u2019s price drop. Such testimony requires a witness with specialized knowledge about the stock market.",

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant has been charged with selling cocaine. On the night of the alleged sale, a police officer arrested a woman and found a large package of cocaine in her car. The woman was brought to the police station for questioning. During her interrogation, she admitted to a police officer that she had sold cocaine and said that she had obtained the cocaine from the defendant, who was a local supplier. By the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, the woman has left the country. The prosecutor calls the police officer to testify that the woman told him that the defendant was her cocaine supplier. The defendant\u2019s attorney objects. Is the woman\u2019s statement to the police officer admissible to prove that the defendant sold cocaine?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the prosecutor has not shown that the woman\u2019s attendance at trial could not have been procured through process or other reasonable means.\nC. Yes, as the statement of the defendant\u2019s coconspirator.\nD. Yes, as the woman\u2019s declaration against penal interest.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The woman\u2019s statement to the police officer is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Thus, it is hearsay. The statement does not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule. The woman\u2019s statement is not admissible. B is incorrect. The prosecutor does not need to show that the woman\u2019s attendance at trial could not be procured through process or other reasonable means before the woman\u2019s statement can be used against the defendant. The statement can be used against the defendant even if the woman cannot be compelled to testify against herself. C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement to the police officer was not made to the police officer by the defendant. The woman was not a co-conspirator with the defendant. The defendant and the woman were not in a conspiracy to sell cocaine. Moreover, there is no indication that the woman is unavailable. D is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement to the police officer is not a declaration against penal interest. A declaration against penal interest is a statement that is made at or near the end of the declarant\u2019s life, that the declarant knows will be used against the declarant if made, and that deals with a fact that could be the basis of a penal action against the declarant. The woman made her statement to the police officer after being arrested for the sale of cocaine. At the time she made the statement, the police officer could not and did not threaten her with any type of criminal penalty. The threat of criminal penalty must be made by someone with the authority to prosecute or investigate the declarant. A prosecutor does not have the authority to prosecute or investigate the declarant. Thus, the woman\u2019s statement is not a declaration against penal interest.\n",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The witness\u2019s consumption of alcohol is an extrinsic factor that may be used to impeach her testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(b)(3). The rule allows the use of extrinsic evidence to impeach a hearsay testimony if the extrinsic evidence would affect the assessment of the witness\u2019s credibility. In addition, the testimony about the music is admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 4514 as a prior identification of a witness. The testimony that the music was extremely loud would be a prior identification of the eyewitness because it would indicate that she could not properly hear what was happening at the time of the shooting. Although the testimony would typically be ruled admissible only after it is first ruled relevant, here the judge should rule that the testimony is admissible now because it is clear that it would be admissible if and when it is ultimately ruled to be relevant. B is incorrect because the testimony is not being offered to impeach the eyewitness\u2019s character but rather to show that her inability to hear the argument may have caused her to mishear what happened. C is incorrect because the testimony about the eyewitness\u2019s alcohol consumption is admissible as an extrinsic impeachment.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant is on trial as one of the armed robbers of a liquor store. The defendant testifies that he robbed the store involuntarily because his fellow gang members threatened to kill him right then if he backed out, as he wanted to do. Thereafter, the defense seeks to call a witness who would testify that six months after the defendant was arrested in connection with the robbery, the defendant told him that he had been threatened when he wanted to pull out of the robbery. The prosecution objects to the witness\u2019s testimony. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it includes the defendant\u2019s own hearsay statement that is not within any exception.\nB. No, because it includes a self-serving statement offered by a criminal accused.\nC. Yes, because the defendant\u2019s hearsay statement fits the state of mind exception.\nD. Yes, because it includes the prior consistent statement of the defendant, who testified as a witness.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The witness\u2019s testimony is not hearsay, because it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted \u2013 that the gang members threatened the defendant. (The testimony is not being offered to prove that the gang members made the threat; it is being offered only to prove that the defendant believed the threat had been made.) But more importantly, it is not exceptionable hearsay, because it is not circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. It is testimony about the defendant\u2019s state of mind when he robbed the store. This type of evidence is specifically excluded from the definition of hearsay. B is correct. The witness\u2019s testimony is not hearsay, because it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted \u2013 that the gang members threatened the defendant. (The testimony is not being offered to prove that the gang members made the threat; it is being offered only to prove that the defendant believed the threat had been made.)

It is testimony about the defendant\u2019s state of mind when he robbed the store. This type of evidence is specifically excluded from the definition of hearsay. C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement to the witness may be admissible as a prior consistent statement to prove the witness\u2019s belief that the defendant had threatened the gang members. However, it does not fit the state of mind exception. The exception to the hearsay rule provides that a statement is admissible if it describes or explains an event or condition that existed at the time of the making of the statement, and the statement is not specifically meant to be testimony about the condition. However, it is unclear what effect, if any, the threatened murder had on the defendant\u2019s actions. It is conceivable that the threat had no effect on his actions. D is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s prior consistent statement is admissible, as a prior consistent statement to prove the witness\u2019s belief that the defendant had threatened the gang members. It is irrelevant that the statement is also being used to prove the defendant\u2019s belief about his own actions.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

In opposing the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff offers a copy of the local newspaper that contains a front-page story about the plaintiff\u2019s petition for bankruptcy, along with evidence that the defendant is a daily subscriber to the newspaper. The defendant objects to admission of the newspaper story. Is the newspaper story admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the plaintiff has not offered proper authentication of the story.\nB. No, because the story constitutes hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, because the story satisfies the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. This is an example of a self-authenticating document. The stipulation that the local newspaper is self-authenticating means that, although normally the publication of a newspaper is not sufficient authentication for a document, in this case the publication is treated as if it were a authentication by the editor of the newspaper. Since the local newspaper is self-authenticating, the mere fact that the defendant was a daily subscriber is sufficient authentication for the story to identify the plaintiff's petition for bankruptcy as being the front-page story identified by the parties. Thus, B is incorrect. A is incorrect. The newspaper story is not an out-of-court statement, it is a published record of an event, the plaintiff's filing for bankruptcy. Therefore, it is not hearsay. In addition, the newspaper story is not being offered for its truth, but instead to establish the plaintiff's petition for bankruptcy. C is incorrect.

Six months after the opening, while the friend continued to operate the tavern, the municipality in which the property is located validly condemned the property. There are no applicable statutes. To whom should the condemnation proceeds be paid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. To the friend and the grantor in equal shares, because they both had an interest in the property.\nB. To the friend, because he was in possession on the date of the condemnation.\nC. To the friend, because the limitation is an invalid restraint on the sale of alcohol.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The estate of the friend\u2019s devisory legal interest (the commercial property) merged into the estate of his possessory interest when he began to possess the property and opened a tavern. However, the grantor retained a resulting trust of the real property. Therefore, when the property was condemned, the proceeds should have been paid to the friend and the grantor in equal shares. B is incorrect. The friend was able to begin to possess the property because he opened a tavern, which means that the friend had taken \"actual physical possession\" of the property and thus had taken substantive possession. Thus, answer B is incorrect because the friend had substantive possession, not just \"constructive\" possession. C is incorrect. There is no valid restraint on the sale of alcohol, because such a restraint is a restraint on the use of the land, not a restraint on the use of the alcohol. D is incorrect.

Each conveyance was by a deed of gift containing a covenant specifying that only one single-story home could be constructed on the conveyed lot in order to preserve views of a nearby lake from the mother\u2019s lot. The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot. Several years later, the son conveyed his vacant lot to a purchaser using a warranty deed that made no mention of the covenant in the previous deed from the mother. The purchaser promptly recorded her deed. When the purchaser later began constructing a three-story house similar to the mother\u2019s, the mother sued to enjoin the construction. Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, since she herself constructed a three-story house.\nB. No, because there was no consideration given for the covenants in the deeds of gift.\nC. Yes, because the burden of the covenant runs with the land even if the purchaser had no actual notice of the covenant.\nD. Yes, because the mother is in privity of contract with the purchaser.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. While the traditional view was that restrictive covenants ran with the land and not with the grantees, the Supreme Court, in Maitland v. City of Santa Barbara, 403 U.S. 127 (1971), held that this was an unconstitutional restraint on alienation. The issue in that case, however, did not involve a deed that contained an express grant of rights to subsequent grantees, as these deeds often contain. Instead, the issue in Maitland was whether a constitutionally valid covenant survived the interest of the grantee who was seeking to enforce the covenant. The majority held that such covenants were not constitutionally valid restraints on alienation. In this case, however, the covenants in these deeds contain explicit grants to subsequent grantees, as these deeds often contain. Accordingly, the Supreme Court, in Banco Mexicano v. Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 245 (1987), held such covenants to be valid restraints on alienation, and such holding has not been overturned since that time. Accordingly, B is incorrect. A is incorrect. The fact that the mother is in privity of contract with each grantee does not estop her from enforcing the terms of the covenants, which are covenants running with the land. Such estoppel applies only to those rights that are personal and proprietary in nature. The restriction is a covenant running with the land, and it is enforceable by any grantee or their heirs and assigns. D is incorrect.

The executor of the woman\u2019s estate has asserted that the nephew has no interest in the home. Is the executor correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the nephew recorded the deed before the woman\u2019s death.\nB. No, because the woman\u2019s death did not affect the nephew\u2019s future interest in the home.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The woman's warranty deed to the nephew created a fee simple determinable and a possibility of reverter in the woman. A fee simple determinable has the potential to be terminated (the interest being \"determined\" when the condition that will cause it to terminate occurs), and a possibility of reverter gives the grantor the right to reenter the land after the occurrence of the event that will cause the termination. In this case, the nephew's interest would be terminated if he failed to marry. The woman's death did not affect the nephew's future interest, because the nephew's interest was only contingent upon his marriage. Thus, A and C are incorrect. D is incorrect.

Her friend agreed to loan her the entire purchase price if, immediately following the purchase, the woman would deed the land to him. They also agreed that the woman would have 10 years in which to repay the loan and that the friend would deed the land back to the woman when the loan was fully repaid. Lastly, they agreed that during the 10-year period the woman could live on the land. The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her. The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB. No, because the contract between the woman and her friend merged into the deed.\nC. Yes, because the parties agreed that the woman could live on the land.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The friend's deed to himself was taken in order to benefit himself, his friend, and his friend's ability to live on the land. Therefore, the deed of trust was a trust for beneficiaries, rather than a security interest for creditors, and thus equitable rather than legal. The equitable mortgage is a promise to pay if the beneficiary (the friend) is ousted from possession. The mortgage promise is enforceable regardless of whether the friend has been ousted.

Five years later, the woman lost her job, had difficulty making her mortgage payments, and defaulted on several payments. The bank notified the woman that it would accelerate the mortgage debt as permitted by the mortgage. The woman tried to sell the house but could not find a buyer. The woman wants to avoid the publicity of a foreclosure sale and protect her credit rating. The house is not encumbered by any other liens. The woman has asked the bank if it would accept a deed to the house and relieve her from any further liability on the loan. The bank is receptive to the woman\u2019s proposal. Is the woman\u2019s proposal a viable foreclosure substitute under these facts?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because such a transaction would be a clog on the woman\u2019s equitable right of redemption.\nB. No, because this is residential property for which a foreclosure sale is required.\nC. Yes, because the proposal is voluntary and the bank would receive unencumbered title from the woman.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The mortgage documents allow the bank to accelerate the mortgage debt, which it did. The woman's proposal to convey the property to the bank in return for being released of liability on the loan is voluntary, and the conveyance would be a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Unlike a normal foreclosure sale, a deed in lieu results in unencumbered title being conveyed to the foreclosing party. Thus, C is correct. A is incorrect. A deed in lieu would not clog the woman's right of equitable redemption because it is not a return of the equity of redemption. Such a return occurs when a foreclosure sale is held. B is incorrect. The proposal is not residential property. In any event, the woman would be voluntarily conveyancing the property, not subject to a statutory foreclosure process. D is incorrect.

Seventeen years ago, the city discontinued using the land as a park. Because the city needed additional parking for nearby city buildings, it paved the land and has used it as a parking lot ever since. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Last year, the woman died intestate, leaving a son as her only heir. The son sued the city, claiming ownership of the land, but the court found against him. What is the most likely explanation for the court\u2019s decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The woman's deed to the city was a fee simple determinable, meaning that it was a fee simple subject to an outside limitator (the city's use it for park purposes) and was also potentially revocable (by a later conveyance). Because the city's use of the land as a parking lot has been open and visible for the last ten years (the jurisdiction's statutory period for adverse possession) and has prevented the reversion of the fee from returning to the original grantee (the city), the city's use of the land has become adverse to any potential claim the woman might have had. As such, the land is city's by adverse possession. A is incorrect. The woman's deed was not a fee simple ab initio. In a fee simple ab initio, there are no limitations on the grantee's title and it will revest in the grantor (who retained no interest in the property) if it is not used in a manner in violation of the grantor's interests. C is incorrect. The woman's interest ended because the city's adverse possession (which arose from its visible, open possession) merged the two interests into one. However, the woman's reversionary interest was not terminated because she (or her successors in interest) could have brought an appropriate action to terminate the city's possession or to quiet title.

After acceleration, the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against both the commercial building and the motel owned by the mother. The mother timely objected to the foreclosure proceedings against the motel. The bank responded that it had the right to include both the commercial building and the motel in the foreclosure proceedings. Who is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because the motel was voluntarily mortgaged to secure the man\u2019s debt.\nB. The bank, because the mother is personally liable on any loan secured by the mortgage on the motel.\nC. The mother, because she did not sign a promissory note.\nD. The mother, because the bank does not hold an enforceable mortgage on the motel.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The mortgage on the motel that the mother granted to the bank was not a mortgage of the mother's home. This is because, although the mortgage was taken to secure the man's debt to the bank, the mortgage was on a property that the mother had granted a mortgage on in the capacity of a promoter or originator. Such a mortgage does not fall within any of the statutory requirements for a mortgage of a home, such as the statute defining a mortgage of a home as including a warranty of title. As such, the mortgage on the motel that the mother granted to the bank was never valid, and the bank does not hold an enforceable mortgage on the motel. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect. A is incorrect because it misstates the applicable law. In its foreclosure action, the bank holds two mortgages: one from the man securing the bank and the other from the mother securing the man. The bank may include both mortgages in its foreclosure proceeding because each mortgage was taken to secure the man\u2019s debt to the bank. B is incorrect. B is incorrect because it misstates the applicable law. In its foreclosure action, the mortgage from the mother securing the man is subject to the defenses that the mother has personally defaulted and that the mortgage was not taken in the capacity of a promoter or originator. C is incorrect. C is incorrect because it misstates the applicable law. The mortgage from the mother securing the man is not a mortgage of the mother's home. This is because, although the mortgage was taken to secure the man's debt to the bank, the mortgage was on a property that the mother had granted a mortgage on in the capacity of a promoter or originator.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA man owned an oceanfront cottage. A woman owned land across the street that did not have direct ocean access.

The deed was never recorded. Several years later, the woman sold her land. The woman made no mention of the easement, and the buyer had no actual notice of it. After the buyer took possession of the land, neighbors informed her about the pedestrian easement over the man\u2019s land, but when the buyer attempted to use the easement, the man informed her that it was no longer available and constructed a chain-link fence to block the way. The buyer promptly sued the man to establish her right to use the easement. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The buyer, because the easement was appurtenant to her land.\nB. The buyer, because the man received $10,000.\nC. The man, because the buyer purchased the land without notice.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The easement appurtenant that the man granted to the woman allows the woman and her assigns and heirs to use the man's land to walk to the ocean. Because the easement benefited the woman's land only, it is an easement appurtenant. An easement appurtenant requires both a dominant and servient tenement. The time period of the easement must be as long as the period of time that the original land is held by the owner. After the woman recorded title to the land, she inherited (as an easement appurtenant) the man's right to use her land to access the ocean. When the woman sold her land, the deed was not recorded, so no one knew about the easement except the woman's neighbor. When the buyer first tried to use the easement, the man could no longer terminate her use of the easement, and, therefore, B is incorrect. The man was not the owner of the land that the easement affected. C is incorrect. The recording of the deed created an awareness of the easement to anyone who conducted a routine title search. D is incorrect. The easement was for the benefit of the woman, who was the intended beneficiary. Therefore, the easement was an easement in gross.\n",

An easement appurtenant passes with the title, and now the buyer has the benefit of the easement. It is irrelevant that the buyer had no actual notice of the easement when she bought the land. Answer B is incorrect. The fact that the man received $10,000 is irrelevant. The man granted the woman an easement appurtenant, which runs with the dominant estate. An easement appurtenant may be granted by purchase or by gift. Answer C is incorrect. The buyer did purchase the land without any type of notice, but this is not a reason for the man to prevail. The easement is for the benefit of whoever owns the land. The buyer can still assert her right to the easement appurtenant because the easement has not terminated.   Answer D is incorrect.

The nephew soon discovered that the land was subject to a mortgage held by a local bank, which required monthly payments for the next 10 years. Without telling the niece or seeking her permission, the nephew paid the monthly mortgage payments for one year. The nephew then demanded immediate payment from the niece for half of the mortgage payments he had made. The niece refused. If the nephew sues the niece for contribution, who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of exoneration.\nB. The nephew, because without his payments, the bank could have foreclosed the mortgage and they could have lost the land.\nC. The niece, because any such payment is not due until a partition proceeding is held.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Although the nephew and the niece held the land in common ownership, the nephew made the decision to pay the mortgage payments on behalf of both parties. In doing so, he subjected his interest to the mortgage, thus extinguishing any interest the niece might have had in the property. The nephew's failure to consult the niece before making the payments suggests that the nephew was attempting to rid himself of an undesirable cotenancy arrangement, and therefore the niece likely will not be held liable for contributions. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect. Exoneration is not applicable to the facts because the mortgage payments were made by the nephew alone, and he was not exonerated. B is incorrect. While this answer correctly states that the nephew's payments prevented foreclosure, it ignores the effect of the payments on the niece's interest in the land. C is incorrect. A partition action would be required only if the cotenants sought a resolution of their respective rights to the land, and this fact is not stated in the facts.\n",

The nephew paid more than his pro rata share and thus may recover the amount owed by the niece in a contribution action. Answer A is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration applies when land that is subject to a mortgage is acquired at the time of death and an attempt is made by the specific legatee to claim that the mortgage must be paid from general estate assets, a scenario that does not exist here. Answer C is incorrect. A partition action is not required before bringing an action for contribution for making mortgage payments that, if not made, might have resulted in the foreclosure on the property by the bank.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. A sale of land is not considered complete until the seller has delivered a marketable title to the buyer. A title is considered marketable if it is free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictions, covenants, easements or other limiting provisions. An encumbrance does not need to be identified to make the title unmarketable--it merely needs to exist, whether the purchaser knows of it or not. Because the gas station will create restrictions and easements that were not present when the seller delivered a marketable title, the buyer, even if he did not know about the restrictions, may rescind his contract. A is incorrect. simply knowing of an encumbrance on title is not enough, alone, to render the title unmarketable. The purchaser must actually accept the title with knowledge of the encumbrance. Because the facts state that the purchaser discovered the restrictive covenant after a title search, he did not accept the title with knowledge of the encumbrance. B is incorrect. The doctrine of equitable conversion requires a seller to deliver a marketable title to the buyer, but it does not impose a duty to inform on the part of the seller. D is incorrect.

The mortgage was promptly recorded. Six months later, the bank assigned only the promissory note to an investor. The assignment made no express reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The bank immediately sent the buyer a notice of the assignment, which provided the address of the investor and explained that the bank was no longer servicing the loan.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The supplier became convinced that the lookout was a police informant. He persuaded the dealer that they should kill the lookout to avoid problems. They purchased a gun and ammunition to commit the murder and planned to dispose of the lookout\u2019s body by pushing it off a cliff. The supplier arranged a meeting in a remote area of a state park. After the three men arrived, the supplier fired two shots at the lookout, who fell to the ground. Both the supplier and the dealer believed that the lookout was dead. The dealer subsequently pushed the lookout\u2019s body off a nearby cliff. Unbeknownst to the supplier and the dealer, the lookout had been wounded by the bullets but was not dead; he died as a result of the fall from the cliff. Can the supplier be convicted of murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the shooting and the disposal of the body were separate events that cannot be viewed as a single scheme or plan.\nB. No, because the supplier did not intend that the fall from the cliff would kill the lookout.\nC. Yes, because both the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of the original plan to kill the lookout.\nD. Yes, because the supplier believed that his shots had killed the lookout.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. A can be convicted of murder even though no single act itself would itself constitute murder if the defendant's actions were part of a general scheme to commit murder. The supplier, the dealer, and the supplier arranged to purchase a gun and ammunition to commit murder, planned to commit that murder against the lookout, and after the shooting and after the disposal of the body were part of a scheme to commit murder against the lookout. Because all of these actions were part of a general scheme to commit murder, the supplier can be convicted of murder. A charge of murder requires that the defendant have the specific intent that a human life be taken. In this case, the supplier, along with the dealer, had the intent to commit murder against the lookout, and the supplier can be convicted of murder. B is incorrect because the supplier did, along with the dealer, have the intent to commit murder against the lookout, regardless of whether he intended that the lookout fall to his death. Furthermore, the supplier can be convicted of murder because the actions of the supplier and the dealer were part of a scheme to commit murder. D is incorrect because the supplier did not intend to kill the lookout by pushing him off the cliff, but because the supplier was part of the scheme to commit murder against the lookout, and the actions were done with the intent to commit murder, the supplier can be convicted of murder.\n",

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect.

B is correct. The state in which the accident occurred does have an offense of involuntary manslaughter.

Voluntary intoxication is a defense to the specific intent element of a charge, but it cannot be a defense to the commission of a criminal offense. D is incorrect.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The instructions sought by the defendant would be proper. A court must instruct on lesser included offenses if the evidence presents a rational basis for finding the defendant not guilty of the charge but guilty of the lesser included offense. There is a rational basis for a jury to find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense of aggravated theft but guilty of the lesser included offense of simple theft. It is rationally possible that the jury could find that the equipment was not worth more than $1,000, thus finding the defendant not guilty of the aggravating factor that the crime was worth more than $1,000. However, it is also rationally possible that the jury could find that the value of the equipment was above $1,000, which would be incompatible with a finding that the defendant committed simple theft, which requires that the value be less than $1,000. Thus, there is a rational basis for a jury to find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense but guilty of the lesser included offense of simple theft.

To determine whether the man was serious, an undercover officer introduced himself to the man at a bar. The officer said that he had previously taken care of problems for angry spouses. After some discussion in which the man expressed his extreme anger at his ex-wife, the man offered the officer $5,000 to kill her. The officer agreed and made arrangements to meet the man at the bar the next day to collect the $5,000 payment. When the man showed up the next day at the bar, authorities immediately arrested him. The jurisdiction defines attempt, solicitation, and misprision of a felony as at common law, and also punishes bilateral conspiracies. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. What is the most serious crime of which the man can properly be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Attempted murder.\nB. Conspiracy to commit murder.\nC. Solicitation of murder.\nD. Misprision of a felony.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The man attempted to murder his ex-wife. Although the officer was making a false statement to him, the man took substantial steps toward the commission of murder, and the officer intended that the man commit murder. The man should not be convicted of any more serious offense than that which is attained by the lightest offense of any of the co-conspirators. B is incorrect. The man and the officer did not agree to commit murder; they agreed to commit misdemeanor assault. Further, a bilateral conspiracy requires two people to reach an agreement, whereas there was only one party committing the offense of conspiracy. C is incorrect. To be charged with or convicted of solicitation of murder, the man had to provide more than just words; he had to provide some kind of overt act showing his seriousness. His discussion of paying $5,000 and his statements of extreme anger were not sufficient. D is incorrect. The man knew of the officer's existence, but did not know that the officer was an undercover officer and had not aided or abetted the crime of murder.\n",

Answer A is incorrect because the facts do not show that the man took sufficient steps toward completing a murder. The man did nothing but offer to pay, and this conduct is not \u201cdangerously proximate\u201d to the commission of the offense as required by the common law. Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony. Additionally, the facts do not establish a misprision. That offense   occurs when a person fails to inform the authorities about a felony that the person knows about.",

No crime.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The friend is liable as an accessory to the bank robbery committed by the two women committed. To be an accessory to a crime, the defendant must have the intent that the crime be committed and aid and abet in the commission of the offense. Here, the friend provided transportation to and from the bank, knowing both his transportation and the women's actions were for the purpose of committing a bank robbery. The friend is an accessory and can be convicted of bank robbery as an accessory after the fact. B is incorrect. The friend is not an accomplice to the bank robbery. To be an accomplice, the defendant must aid the principal in the commission of the offense and have the intent to aid in the commission of the offense. Here, the friend simply transported the women to and from the bank and had the same intent as the women--to commit a bank robbery. The friend neither aided the women in the commission of the bank robbery nor had the same intent. C is incorrect. The friend and the two women did not agree to commit a crime. The friend simply agreed to help the women get where they were going. D is incorrect. The friend is criminally liable for his actions and is an accessory to the bank robbery. The fact that the women failed to complete their crime by not taking the money from the bags or getting away with it does not eliminate the friend's criminal liability.

After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Yes, because defense counsel is required to present any known mitigating factors in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. While defense strategy may constitute a reasonable basis for a decision by a lawyer not to investigate, a lawyer may not rely on a strategy that violates a basic professional responsibility. Here, the defendant\u2019s assigned counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate may well have violated his basic professional responsibility because the defendant\u2019s unsavory background and childhood might well be mitigating. The issue here is not whether the strategy would work or not but rather whether the attorney\u2019s action violated basic professional responsibility. If the assigned counsel failed to investigate because he feared that investigating would reflect poorly on his client, then he violated his basic professional responsibility, and his action is ineffective assistance of counsel. B is incorrect. While the Strickland standard is chained to the behavior of other attorneys, it is also tied to a substantive constitutional standard. Thus, it is not sufficient that the defense attorney only adhere to an objective standard; the defendant must show that the attorney\u2019s actions were unreasonable in light of the objectives of the penalty phase. C is correct. In the penalty phase, a defendant is entitled to have the trier of fact consider any mitigating evidence that it deems relevant. Counsel has a duty to investigate potential mitigating evidence and to present it to the jury, unless the investigation would be an unreasonable use of scarce resources. Because failure to investigate is ineffective assistance of counsel in both the guilt and penalty phases of a capital case, failure to investigate in the penalty phase is also unconstitutional in the guilt phase. D is incorrect. A court may not grant a petition for post-conviction relief based solely on ineffective assistance of counsel in the guilt phase. Thus, Answer D is incorrect and can be disregarded.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
