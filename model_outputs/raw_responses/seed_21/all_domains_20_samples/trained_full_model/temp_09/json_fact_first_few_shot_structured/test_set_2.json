Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct because on its face the ordinance discriminates against commerce from outside the city. By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory. Such facially discriminatory laws are allowed only in the absence of any nondiscriminatory way to promote the government\u2019s interest. C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994). Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest. Answer C is incorrect. Because the law is facially discriminatory, it is not subject to the \u201cundue burden\u201d test.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations is not the proper standard. Because the government is demanding public access to the property in exchange for a permit to build, the test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development.

Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause.

Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed.

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A.

Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct because a reasonable jury could find that the defendant was twice kicked in the groin by the victim prior to the homicide, and on that basis could conclude that the defendant had adequate provocation. Even      though it is a single witness who recounts this event, a jury can credit a single witness\u2019s testimony. Answer A is incorrect because the state offered evidence of a serious battery on the defendant, which can constitute an adequate provocation, no matter which party presented the evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the judge\u2019s job is not to weigh the evidence but is only to determine whether a reasonable jury could find adequate provocation. The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis.

Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374. Answer A is incorrect. A breaching party cannot recover on a theory of reliance. Answer B is incorrect. This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation.

Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale. Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale rather than seeking costs and lost profit.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation. Answer D is incorrect. The trial judge has the discretion to alter the order of proof without a showing of specific prejudice by an opposing party.",

The contract required the farmer to pay the purchase price of $100,000 in cash on January 15. On that date, the farmer tendered a certified check for $100,000 payable to the order of the landowner, but the landowner refused to accept it. The reason for the landowner's refusal was that the farmer was also obligated to pay $20,000 to a neighboring landowner on January 15 for the purchase of Blackacre, a tract of farmland that was adjacent to Greenacre.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The routine practice of the company\u2019s agents in discussing supplemental policy options with customers is admissible under FRE 406. Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury. Answer B is incorrect. To constitute habit evidence, an organization\u2019s practice need not be \u201cautomatic\u201d but only routine\u2014something that is regularly done. The supervisor\u2019s testimony here is that the agents\u2019 regular practice is to discuss supplemental policy options with customers. Answer C is incorrect. Character evidence is not admissible in civil cases to prove conduct. See FRE 404(a) and (b).

The court denied the motion. When the child entered the courtroom to testify, the defendant became unruly, moving as though he was about to lunge from his chair toward the child. The judge warned the defendant to stop the behavior. After a second warning, the judge told the defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to behave inappropriately. The defendant then shouted a threat at the child. At that point, the court ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom.

The defendant appealed the conviction, challenging only his exclusion from the courtroom. Should the court of appeals reverse the conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The first part of the psychiatrist\u2019s proposed testimony is admissible, but the second part\u2014that the defendant was legally insane\u2014is inadmissible. Under FRE 704(b), an expert in a criminal case may not state an opinion about whether a defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. Such testimony is inadmissible because it is an opinion about whether the defendant had a mental state that constitutes a defense. Answer A is incorrect. As explained above, under FRE 704(b), an expert in a criminal case may not state an opinion about whether a defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. Thus, the first part of the psychiatrist\u2019s proposed testimony is admissible, as it will be helpful to the jury, but the second part is not. Answer B is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a judgment on the pleadings may be made after the pleadings are closed. However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be premature.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) specifically authorizes relief if the \u201cjudgment is void.\u201d Because the court had no personal jurisdiction over the attorney in the action, the judgment is void. Answer A is incorrect. Relief from a default judgment is available only for the reasons listed under Rule 60(b), and the attorney first must show that he falls within one of those provisions. If he does not, then it is immaterial that he has a meritorious defense.      Answer B is incorrect. Rule 60(b) lists six possible grounds for relief from a judgment, and none of them looks to whether the movant\u2019s conduct was reasonable in the underlying action. Answer D is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

Here, the deed from the man to the woman is outside of the entrepreneur\u2019s chain of title even though they share a common grantor. Thus, knowing whether the jurisdiction\u2019s law puts a buyer on notice of all land transfers of the buyer\u2019s grantor, even those outside of the chain of title, is essential. If it does, the entrepreneur had a duty to search the title for the westerly tract. Answer A is incorrect. The type of index does not determine what instruments are in the chain of title. Answer B is incorrect. The recording system does not affect whether the entrepreneur is a good-faith purchaser for value. Answer D is incorrect. The intended use of the land does not affect the determination of whether the entrepreneur was aware of the recorded restriction.",

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. Acceleration clauses are valid. While typically triggered by nonpayment of the mortgage debt, they can also be triggered by the mortgagor\u2019s failure to satisfy other conditions in the mortgage, such as timely payment of insurance premiums. Answer A is incorrect. Once acceleration has properly occurred, the consequences cannot be avoided because the owner attempts to pay the delinquent insurance premium. Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect. The desire to bring a foreclosure action does not create a right to accelerate a mortgage. Rather, the right to accelerate depends upon whether a term of a mortgage has been breached. Such a term may include, as here, the failure to pay an insurance premium.",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The deed in lieu of foreclosure does not extinguish the subsequent mortgage on the property. A mortgagor\u2019s later-executed mortgage generally can be extinguished only by foreclosure. Thus, the holder of the senior lien (the seller) should have searched the title to determine if a junior lien existed and, if so, brought a foreclosure action to extinguish it rather than accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Answer A is incorrect. The status of the investor, the junior lienholder, is not affected by that lienholder\u2019s failure to cure the mortgagor\u2019s default. Answer B is incorrect. The general rule that a deed in lieu of foreclosure does not extinguish subsequent mortgages is unaffected by whether the senior lien was a purchase money mortgage or not. Answer D is incorrect. The reason for obtaining the junior mortgage is irrelevant. It is not extinguished by the deed in lieu of foreclosure.",

Before the closing, the buyer\u2019s attorney advised him to purchase a standard-form, $300,000 title insurance policy naming the buyer as the insured.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by deed\u201d or \u201cafter-acquired property.\u201d Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple to the purchaser (the son\u2019s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired it from the son.      Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a finished product by the product\u2019s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the component is what rendered the finished product defective. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 5 (1998). In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer A is incorrect. The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met). Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine of strict products liability. Answer D is incorrect. The mere knowledge that the sand needed to be properly mixed with water and cement to make sound concrete is not sufficient to render the distributor liable for an injury caused by the defective concrete.",

Intrusion upon seclusion is one of the four privacy torts recognized by the Second Restatement of Torts and most states. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A\u2013E (1977).

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver. Even under the \u201cextended personality\u201d doctrine\u2014which, for example, allows a battery plaintiff to establish the necessary contact element if the defendant touches an article of clothing the plaintiff is wearing\u2014making contact with the bus is almost certain not to count as contacting the driver\u2019s person. Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect. The driver is not likely to be considered to have a possessory interest in the damaged bus, and therefore trespass to chattels would not be a viable claim.",

Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient).

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",
