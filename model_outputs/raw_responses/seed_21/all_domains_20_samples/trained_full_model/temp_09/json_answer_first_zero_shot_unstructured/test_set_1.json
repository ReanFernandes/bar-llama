For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, a court may consider a wide array of factors in determining whether parties are diverse. These factors include, but are not limited to, the places where the parties or their agents did business, the places where they owned property, and the places where they were sued. Here, the shareholder wants to sue the car manufacturing company in federal court. The shareholder lives in State A and the company is based in State B. The shareholder's attorney should consider the location of the company's major place of manufacturing. If that manufacturing facility is located in State A, then the court would likely find that the shareholder and the company are not diverse. If, however, the manufacturing facility is located in State B, then the court would find that the shareholder and the company are diverse. B is incorrect because a court also considers a party's minimum contacts to determine diversity jurisdiction. Here, the shareholder lives in State A and the company is based in State B. The shareholder's attorney should consider the location of the company's headquarters. If that headquarters is located in State A, then the court would likely find that the shareholder and the company are not diverse.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect.

If the jury's verdict is not supported by the evidence, the appellate court may find that the error in the jury instructions constitutes plain error. To find an error to be plain, the appellate court must find that the error: (i) is clear or obvious, and (ii) affects a substantial right of the defendant. Here, the jury found for the plaintiff, so the defendant is the one making the argument that there was error in the jury instructions. The defendant will argue that the jury's verdict is not supported by sufficient evidence, and that the court's jury instructions on the standard of proof were erroneous. The plaintiff will argue that any errors in the jury instructions did not affect the defendant's substantial rights. To determine whether the defendant's substantial rights were affected by the error, the court will ask whether the error: (i) was clear or obvious, and (ii) affected a substantial right of the defendant. Because the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant must show that the error was both clear and affected a substantial right in order to prevail on the appeal. If the defendant cannot show that the error was both clear and affected a substantial right, the appellate court will uphold the jury's verdict. Answer B is incorrect because a motion for a directed verdict is not a prerequisite to an appeal based on jury instruction error. Answer C is incorrect because the court's discretion over jury instructions does not mean that any error is subject to a harmless error analysis. Answer D is incorrect because the defendant does not need to object at trial in order to preserve the issue for appeal.

The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense.

However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

No, because neither a carrier\u2019s registration nor its payment of a nominal fee is necessary to facilitate the application of state laws to motor carriers.\nB. No, because the requirements impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB.

The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race.

The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value.

Unconscionability has been defined as including both procedural and substantive elements: procedural unconscionablity refers to defects in the bargaining process that leave a party with no meaningful choice, while substantive unconscionability refers to contract terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other party. Where one party has substantially more bargaining power than the other, and uses that power to impose a contract on the other party that no reasonable person would agree to, the court will find the contract to be unconscionable. The facts of this case indicate that the wife was under severe duress when she sold her farm to her brother, and that the contract terms were unconscionably favorable to her brother. The wife\u2019s best argument for rescission is that the contract is unconscionable. A is incorrect because duress is a form of illicit influence that causes a person to act against his or her will.

Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

An employee of the agency went to the buyer\u2019s home and knocked on the front door. When the buyer answered, the employee explained that he was there to repossess the car and asked for the car keys. The buyer handed the employee the keys but then asked the employee to allow her to retrieve her laptop computer from the car. The employee declined the request, explaining to the buyer that any possessions in the car could be reclaimed from the company after the car was repossessed. After pleading unsuccessfully with the employee, the buyer shoved the employee away from the door with such force that the employee fell and suffered a broken wrist. The buyer then ran to the car, which was unlocked, and retrieved the laptop. The employee has sued the buyer for battery. The buyer has moved for summary judgment, arguing that she was privileged to act as she did. Should the trial court grant the buyer\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a fact-finder could reasonably conclude that the buyer used excessive force in attempting to defend her property.\nB. No, because after the buyer handed the keys to the employee, the car was no longer her property.\nC. Yes, because a possessor can use nonlethal force to protect his or her property.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The buyer intentionally shoved the employee, which satisfies the prima facie case for battery. As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property.

Private nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with another's use or enjoyment of property. Whether an invasion constitutes a nuisance turns on whether it causes harm of a kind that would be suffered by a normal member of the community. A substantial interference is an interference that is offensive or annoying to the average person in the community--it does not have to be a substantial interference in the economic value of the property. An unreasonable interference is an invasion where the severity of the harm outweighs the utility of the defendant's conduct. Here, the facts indicate that the neighbor's request that the farmer move the equipment was not made until several months after the equipment was placed. This indicates that the equipment did not create a substantial interference with the homeowner's use and enjoyment of her property at the time it was placed.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

FRE 401 defines relevance as evidence having \u201cany tendency to make a fact [of consequence] more probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evidence that the defendant tried to flee from prosecution\u2014that he purchased an airplane ticket to another country using an alias\u2014satisfies the definition of relevance, because it shows his consciousness of guilt. Answer B is incorrect. Evidence of an intent to flee is relevant to show the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt but not to show his motive to commit the crime. The defendant\u2019s attempt to flee the jurisdiction after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime. Answer D is incorrect. Proof of motive is generally relevant and admissible, but evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to flee after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime. Because the evidence is irrelevant to motive, it is inadmissible if offered to prove motive.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

The \"chain of custody\" of a document or other evidence is only relevant to its admissibility as substantive evidence, not to its authentication.

A finding by the court that the prosecution has made a clear and convincing showing that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be is not required.

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception.

A rebuttable presumption arises in favor of a landlord-tenant relationship where a landowner leases land to a tenant for a period of time.

The facts also indicate that the woman retained the use of the land and paid the friend rent for 10 years. The presumption that the transaction was a lease is rebutted where the landowner and the tenant agree that the tenant is to purchase the land. B is incorrect.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base.

Ineffective assistance of counsel has been found where defense counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of a capital murder trial, despite the fact that counsel believed that such evidence existed. Here, the defendant's trial counsel was reluctant to investigate the defendant's background because he was concerned that any evidence of a troubled childhood might reflect badly on the defendant. Counsel's decision not to investigate was a deliberate choice made after considering the facts at hand. As such, it was part of counsel's trial strategy and thus is not a basis for a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim. B is incorrect. The reasonableness standard applies to the constitutionality of a state statute. Ineffective assistance of counsel is not a constitutional issue. Moreover, the reasonableness standard is not a high standard. It has been interpreted to mean that counsel's conduct \"must be measured by what a reasonable person would do under the circumstances.\" A reasonable person would investigate the defendant's background when the defendant's life is at stake. C is incorrect. The fact that counsel failed to present mitigating evidence is not sufficient by itself to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant must show that the evidence existed and that, had it been presented, it would have affected the jury's sentencing decision. Here, the defendant's post-conviction petition alleges that his trial counsel failed to adequately investigate the defendant's background. The defendant must show that counsel failed to uncover evidence of the defendant's background that, had it been presented, would have altered the jury's sentencing decision. The defendant cannot simply allege that mitigating evidence existed. He must show what the mitigating evidence was and how its non-discovery resulted in a constitutionally deficient penalty determination. D is incorrect. The defendant is not required to present every mitigating factor that exists. The defendant only has to present enough evidence to establish that the jury's sentence would likely have been different had the mitigating factor been found by the jury. The defendant does not need to present every mitigating factor that existed. Answer E is incorrect because the facts of this case do not appear to meet the requirements for a habeas corpus petition.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
