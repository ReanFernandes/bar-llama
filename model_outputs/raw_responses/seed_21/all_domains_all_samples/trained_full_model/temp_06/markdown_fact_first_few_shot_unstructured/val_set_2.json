The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn a suit based on a will, inheritance of $1 million depended upon whether the wife had survived her husband when both died in the crash of a small airplane. An applicable statute provided that, for purposes of distributing an estate after a common disaster, there was a rebuttable presumption that neither spouse had survived the other. A witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane she heard what she thought was a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d although by the time the two occupants were removed from the wreckage they were both dead. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.\nB. No, because the witness\u2019s testimony is too speculative to support a finding.\nC.

Yes, because the defendant\u2019s statement, although otherwise privileged, was made without reasonable efforts to\npreserve confidentiality.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Although normally a statement made during a legal proceeding cannot be used against the person who made it, this rule does not apply to a statement made by a party-opponent. A statement made by a party cannot be excluded as hearsay when offered against him by an adverse party. Thus, A is correct. However, the attorney-client privilege extends not only to discussions between the attorney and client, but also to any who are present or who learn of the communications during the conference. Therefore, B is incorrect. Although the defendant\u2019s statement was made in the hallway and not in a conference room, the hallway was within the confines of the court building and thus part of the conferral. Moreover, although the defendant made the statement without reasonable efforts to preserve confidentiality, the attorney-client privilege still applies, and the statement should not be admitted. Thus, C is correct, and A is incorrect. D is incorrect. Although a judge may not testify in a trial over which he or she is presiding, this rule does not apply to testimony regarding a statement made in the course of a legal proceeding. Thus, the judge\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s statement is admissible.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

However, under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence has probative value if it has any tendency to persuade the jury of a fact. In this case, the evidence has some probative value because it links the knife in defendant\u2019s possession to the type of knife that could have caused the victim\u2019s wound.

A is incorrect because the evidence has some probative value, even if it is not very probative. C is incorrect because the evidence is not very probative, but it is not because the medical examiner could not state the probability that the wound was caused by the defendant\u2019s knife.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nWhen a man entered a bank and presented a check for payment, the bank teller recognized the signature on the check as a forgery because the check was drawn on the account of a customer whose handwriting she knew. The bank teller called the police. Before the police arrived, the man picked up the check from the counter and left. The man was charged with attempting to cash a forged check. At trial, the prosecutor called the bank teller to testify that the signature on the check was forged. Is the bank teller\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because a bank teller is by occupation an expert on handwriting.\nB. Yes, because it is rationally based on the bank teller\u2019s perception and is helpful to the jury.\nC. No, because the bank teller was at fault in allowing loss of the original by failing to secure the check.\nD. No, because it is not possible for either the jury or an expert to compare the signature on the missing check with a\nsignature established as genuine.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows lay opinion testimony when it is rationally based on the perception of the witness and is helpful to the jury. Here, the bank teller\u2019s testimony that the signature on the check was a forgery is a lay opinion that the signature on the check was not that of the owner of the account. This testimony is not helpful to the jury because it is a statement about the owner of the account that the signature on the check did not belong to him. The jury already knows that the signature on the check was forged because the check was drawn on the account of a customer whose handwriting the bank teller knew. Thus, the bank teller\u2019s testimony is irrelevant and inadmissible. A is incorrect. Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence does not make handwriting experts infallible. The bank teller\u2019s testimony that the signature was a forgery is a statement about the signature on the check, not about the signature on the bank teller\u2019s file.

Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun. The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to suppress its use as evidence. Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.\nB. Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.\nC. No, because, having found the package, the agents had probable cause to believe more narcotics could be located in\nthe house and the gun was found in a proper search for narcotics.\nD.

Thus, B is correct. A is incorrect. The common law does not require an overt act for conspiracy. C is incorrect. Plurality of agreement is required regardless of whether there is an overt act. D is incorrect. The dealer cannot take advantage of a mistake of law, but he can take advantage of a mistake of fact. Because the dealer believed he was agreeing to buy and distribute heroin, he cannot be convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

Without telling her that he was a diplomat, he explained how she could get into the jewelry store. She agreed to help him burglarize the store. Someone overheard their conversation and reported it to the police. Shortly thereafter, the police arrested the diplomat and the woman. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. Before trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity. The court granted his motion.

One evening, unaware of the hit man\u2019s presence, the neighbor tripped as he was walking toward his house, falling and hitting his head against the front steps. Believing that the neighbor was unconscious, the hit man ran over to him and shot him twice in the chest. When the woman learned of the neighbor\u2019s death, she paid the hit man $10,000. A medical examiner determined that the neighbor was already dead when the hit man shot him. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. The victim must actually die as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct or else a murder did not occur. The woman cannot be guilty of murder, because the hitman did not in fact cause the neighbor\u2019s death. However, the woman can be convicted of attempted murder. An attempt is an act done with the intent to commit a crime where the act falls short of the full commission of the crime. Here, the woman hired a hitman to murder the neighbor, and all of the requisite acts for the commission of a murder occured except that the hitman did not cause the neighbor\u2019s death. Thus, the woman is guilty of attempted murder. Conspiracy and solicitation are not the correct answers. A charge of conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a crime, whereas the woman and the hitman did not agree to commit murder, but rather each intended to commit murder independently. Solicitation requires a request that a crime be committed, which is not present in the facts.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

Narcotics officers went to her neighborhood in the middle of the night. Nothing unlawful could be seen from the street, so the officers walked into the neighbors\u2019 yard and looked through the woman\u2019s kitchen window, which had neither drapes nor shades. The officers observed what appeared to be marijuana plants being cultivated under grow lights in the kitchen. Using this information, the officers obtained a search warrant. The execution of that warrant netted numerous marijuana plants. The woman was charged with possession of marijuana. She moved to suppress the marijuana plants recovered when the warrant was executed, claiming that the evidence supporting the warrant was obtained through a search that violated the Fourth Amendment. Should the marijuana plants be suppressed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because regardless of the lawfulness of the police conduct beforehand, they did obtain a warrant to search the\nwoman\u2019s home.\nB.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the state. A search occurs when the state (acting through its agents) has a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a crime and uses that suspicion to conduct a search of the person or his property. See Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 263 (1995). A seizure occurs when the state (acting through its agents) uses physical force to prevent the person from going free. See Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000). Here, the evidence seized was marijuana plants grown in the woman\u2019s home. The woman did not give the agents permission to enter her home, and the agents did not have a search warrant at the time they entered the home. Therefore, the evidence should be suppressed.

He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store\u2019s property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property.

Although the man\u2019s conviction for larceny of the car should be affirmed, his conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed. The man\u2019s argument that his conviction should be reversed because it violates double jeopardy is incorrect. The man\u2019s conviction for larceny of the car does not need to be reversed before the conviction for malicious damage of property can be affirmed. The fact that the man was convicted of two crimes for a single act does not violate double jeopardy. The jury was instructed to convict the man of both crimes, and it could do so without violating double jeopardy. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA state grand jury investigating a murder learned that the key suspect might have kept a diary. The grand jury issued a subpoena duces tecum requiring the suspect to produce any diary. The subpoena made clear that the grand jury was seeking only the diary and not any testimony from the suspect. The suspect refused to produce the diary, citing the privilege against self-incrimination. Under what circumstances, if any, could the grand jury compel production of the diary over the suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It may compel production without granting immunity because the suspect was not compelled to write a diary.\nB. It may compel production only if the suspect is granted use and derivative use immunity from the act of production.\nC. It may compel production only if the suspect is granted transactional immunity.\nD. It may not compel production of a private diary under any circumstances.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination protects only testimonial or communicative evidence, and not real or physical evidence. Therefore, it protects acts of production that would have testimonial significance by authenticating documents. However, a criminal defendant may be compelled to produce documents that have testimonial significance if immunity is granted to the defendant. There are two kinds of immunity that may be granted. The broader form of immunity is \"transactional immunity.\" Transactional immunity completely protects the witness from future prosecution for crimes related to his or her testimony. \"Use and derivative use\" immunity is narrower--it prevents the prosecution only for crimes directly related to the testimony given. B is correct because it is the broader form of immunity, transactional immunity, that will protect the suspect from future prosecution for crimes related to his production of a diary. A is incorrect. The suspect already has a privilege against self-incrimination by producing the diary, so there is no need to apply the exclusionary rule. D is incorrect. The suspect's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination extends only to testimonial or communicative evidence, and not to real or physical evidence.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

Unfortunately, one of the bullets ricocheted off the wall and killed the man\u2019s best friend. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. On these facts, what is the most serious offense for which the man properly could be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Murder.\nB. Voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter.\nD. Assault.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. Murder is defined at common law as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice does not require the intent to kill; in some cases, there may be no intent to kill at all. Malice can also be implied in actions that show gross recklessness toward human life. In this fact pattern, the man, clearly angry and seeking revenge, fired a shotgun indiscriminately in a populated factory. The man could properly be convicted of murder, which is the most serious offense listed. B is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter is defined at common law as the killing of another human being in a homicide in which there is adequate provocation for the killing. Provocation is an adequate defense if it causes a sudden and passionate response that would normally cause a reasonable person to act as the defendant did. However, the defendant must withdraw immediately after the killing and reflect on the propriety of his actions. In this fact pattern, the man, angry and seeking revenge, fired a shotgun indiscriminately in a populated factory. Although he could properly be convicted of murder, he could not properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter, because his actions did not show adequate provocation for the killing of his best friend. C is incorrect. Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another human being without malice aforethought. The actions in this fact pattern clearly show malice aforethought, so the man could not properly be convicted of involuntary manslaughter. D is incorrect. Assault is the attempt to commit murder or manslaughter. Since the man, angry and seeking revenge, fired a shotgun in the direction of his best friend, it was an attempt to commit murder, and he could properly be convicted of assault.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization\u2019s request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization\u2019s placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator\u2019s decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the administrator\u2019s denial of space to the organization was a reasonable time, manner, and place\nrestriction of speech.\nB. No, because a public official may not allow the use of public facilities for the propagation of a message that he or she\nbelieves may create a false or misleading impression.\nC. Yes, because a public official may not refuse to permit the dissemination of a message in a public forum wholly on the\nbasis of its content unless that denial is necessary to serve a compelling government interest.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The administrator is denying the organization space to post a message because of the content of the message. That denial is a content-based restriction of speech, and it is not necessary to serve a compelling government interest. A court will not uphold a content-based restriction unless the government can prove that the restriction is necessary to serve a compelling government interest. Because the administrator's denial of space is not necessary to serve a compelling government interest, the organization will prevail. A is incorrect because the restriction is on the organization's right to post a message on city property, not on the organization's right to speak.

The group filed suit in federal district court against the Forest Service to force cancellation of the permit. The group claimed solely that the permit violated its First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. The Forest Service conceded that the group\u2019s religious beliefs were sincere and that the ski facility would adversely affect the group\u2019s religious practices. In order to prevail in its First Amendment claim, what must the group show?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Construction of the ski facility will have a discriminatory impact on the group\u2019s religious practices in relation to the\npractices of other religious groups.\nB. The burden on the group\u2019s religious practices imposed by construction of the ski facility outweighs the government\u2019s\ninterest in allowing the facility.\nC.

Under the statute, a state or local government qualifies as an entity owning more than 100 cars if it owns even one electric car. Therefore, the statute regulates the conduct of the state or local government when it comes to the acquisition of vehicles. Because regulating a state or local government when it comes to the acquisition of vehicles could reasonably be expected to have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, the statute satisfies the commerce clause requirement.

In response, the city council enacted an ordinance requiring any \u201csign or visual display\u201d visible on the streets of the historic district to be black and white and to be no more than four feet long or wide. A political party wanted to hang a six-foot-long red, white, and blue political banner in front of a building in the historic district. The party filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the sign ordinance as applied to the display of its banner. Which of the following would be the most useful argument for the political party?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ordinance is not the least restrictive means of promoting a compelling government interest.\nB. The ordinance is not narrowly tailored to an important government interest, nor does it leave open alternative channels\nof communication.\nC. The ordinance imposes a prior restraint on political expression.\nD. The ordinance effectively favors some categories of speech over others.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The political party\u2019s best argument is that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to an important government interest, nor does it leave open alternative channels of communication. Because the ordinance is a content-neutral restriction of expression, it must satisfy intermediate scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires the city to prove that the ordinance is necessary to an important government interest and that it is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. It is not sufficient for the city to prove that the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Additionally, the ordinance must allow alternative channels of communication that are as effective as the one it prohibits. A is incorrect because the ordinance may be a reasonable time, manner, and place restriction as long as it is narrowly tailored to an important government interest. Prior restraint is not a sufficient argument on its own, but it is important because a prior restraint must be narrowly tailored to be constitutional. D is incorrect because it is irrelevant whether some categories of speech are favored over others.

In many other states, such technology was also available at \u201cdiagnostic centers\u201d that were not affiliated with hospitals. A group of physicians announced its plan to immediately open in the state a diagnostic center that would not be affiliated with a hospital. The state hospital association argued to the state legislature that only hospitals could reliably handle advanced medical technologies. The legislature then enacted a law prohibiting the operation in the state of diagnostic centers that were not affiliated with hospitals. The group of physicians filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state law. What action should the court take?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Uphold the law, because the provision of medical services is traditionally a matter of legitimate local concern that\nstates have unreviewable authority to regulate.\nB.

The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community\u2019s residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens\u2019 group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill. The agency officials moved to dismiss. Which of the following is the most appropriate basis for the court to dismiss this suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nB. The interest of the state in obtaining suitable sites for toxic waste landfills is sufficiently compelling to justify the\nselection of the community as a location for such a facility.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The case arguably is not ripe for adjudication because the agency\u2019s inspection does not itself pose any risk of harm to residents of the community.

Because the residents face a risk of harm only if a series of further actions by the agency, the case arguably is not ripe for adjudication. A is incorrect because the case arguably is not ripe for adjudication, not because the case presents a nonjusticiable political question. Furthermore, the interest of the state in obtaining suitable sites for toxic waste landfills is not sufficiently compelling to justify the selection of the community as a location for such a facility. Regardless of the justification for the state\u2019s action, the case arguably is not ripe for adjudication.

Yes, because it contains a jurisdictional provision that will ensure, on a case-by-case basis, that any particular\ncontrolled substance subject to the terms of this statute will, in fact, affect interstate commerce.\nD.

Although the landowner had posted signs that said, \u201cNo Hunting\u2014No Trespassing,\u201d hunters frequently intruded to kill the deer. Recently, the landowner built an eight-foot chain-link fence, topped by three strands of barbed wire, across a gully on her land that provided the only access to the area frequented by the deer. A wildlife photographer asked the landowner for permission to enter the property to photograph the deer. Because the landowner feared that any publicity would encourage further intrusions, she denied the photographer\u2019s request. Frustrated, the photographer attempted to climb the fence. He became entangled in the barbed wire and suffered extensive lacerations. The wounds became infected and ultimately caused his death. The photographer\u2019s personal representative brought an action against the landowner. Will the plaintiff prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the landowner may not use deadly force to protect her land from intrusion.\nB. Yes, because the landowner had no property interest in the deer that entitled her to use force to protect them.\nC. No, because the photographer entered the landowner\u2019s land after the landowner had refused him permission to do so.\nD.

The smoker\u2019s table was in the smoking section, and the nonsmoker\u2019s table was in the nonsmoking section. When the smoker lit a cigarette, the nonsmoker politely requested that he not smoke, explaining that she had a severe allergy to cigarette smoke. The smoker ignored the nonsmoker\u2019s request and continued to smoke. As a result, the nonsmoker was hospitalized with a severe allergic reaction to the smoke. The nonsmoker brought a battery action against the smoker. Which of the following questions will NOT be an issue in the battery action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Did the smoker intend to cause the nonsmoker\u2019s contact with the cigarette smoke?\nB. Does smoke have the physical properties necessary for making the kind of contact required for battery?\nC. Is contact with cigarette smoke from a lawful smoking section in a restaurant the kind of contact one must endure as a\nvoluntary restaurant patron?\nD. Was the smoker\u2019s conduct unreasonable under the circumstances?\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The issue of whether the smoke constitutes a harmful substance is important in a nuisance claim, but it is not a necessary element for a battery claim. A battery is a harmful contact to the person resulting from an intentional tortious contact. Therefore, the issue of whether the smoker intended to cause the nonsmoker\u2019s contact with the cigarette smoke is irrelevant to a battery claim. As stated above, B is not a necessary element of a battery claim, so it is not an issue that will be addressed in this action. A is incorrect because the intentional contact is an essential element of a battery claim. C is incorrect because it is irrelevant whether the contact is with cigarette smoke or with any other harmful substance. The issue of whether the substance is harmful is relevant to a claim of public nuisance, but it is not a necessary element for a battery claim. D is incorrect because it is irrelevant whether the smoker\u2019s conduct is reasonable or unreasonable. A battery is a proximate consequence of an intentional tortious contact, so the issue of reasonableness is not relevant to the battery claim. Because the smoker\u2019s intentional contact with the cigarette resulted in harmful smoke being blown into the nonsmoker\u2019s face, the nonsmoker has a valid battery claim against the smoker.

At the trial of an action brought against the federal government by the farm\u2019s owner, the trier of fact found that the nuclear plant had a sound design, but that a valve made by the Acme Engineering Company had malfunctioned and allowed the radioactive matter to escape, that Acme Engineering Company is universally regarded as a quality manufacturer of components for nuclear plants, and that there was no way the federal government could have anticipated or prevented the emission of the radioactive matter. If there is no other applicable statute, for whom should the trial judge enter judgment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The plaintiff, on the ground that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies.\nB.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Ordinarily, someone who hires an independent contractor to design or build something is not vicariously liable for the contractor\u2019s negligence. However, a landowner who holds his land open to the public has a nondelegable duty to keep the premises safe for business visitors. Such a landowner is liable for any negligence that causes a guest to be injured by unsafe conditions on the premises, even the negligence of an independent contractor. The facts state that the mall owner hired the construction company to design and build the entryway. Because the mall owner holds his land open to the public, he has a nondelegable duty to keep the premises safe for business visitors. Therefore, even the negligence of an independent contractor will cause the landowner to be liable. A is incorrect.

Because the driver is unlikely to have been aware of the dangerous condition that existed on the roof of the plant, he will probably prevail. A is incorrect. The explosives do not present a common danger that is not normally present in the area. The fact that the explosives could, in rare circumstances, escape and cause harm to people in the vicinity does not make the activity abnormally dangerous. B is incorrect. The severity of the windstorm may have eliminated or mitigated the plant\u2019s negligence in this case, but it would not make the activity normal. It remains abnormally dangerous. D is incorrect. Plant location alone does not make an activity abnormally dangerous.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA consumer bought an electric kitchen blender from the manufacturer. Soon after the purchase, the consumer was using the blender in an appropriate way when the blender jar shattered, throwing a piece of glass into the consumer\u2019s eye. The consumer brought an action against the manufacturer based solely on strict product liability. The consumer\u2019s expert testified that the blender was defectively designed. However, because the blender jar was destroyed in the accident, the expert could not determine whether the accident was caused by the design defect or a manufacturing defect. The manufacturer\u2019s expert testified that the blender was not defective. If, at the conclusion of the evidence, both parties move for directed verdicts, how should the trial judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Direct a verdict for the manufacturer, because the consumer\u2019s expert was unable to specify the nature of the defect.\nB. Direct a verdict for the manufacturer, because the consumer\u2019s action was brought solely on a strict liability theory.\nC. Direct a verdict for the consumer, because the blender was new when the jar shattered.\nD. Deny both motions and send the case to the jury, because a jury reasonably could conclude that the harm probably was\ncaused by a defect present in the product when it was sold.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. When a product is sold with a design defect that causes harm to a consumer, the consumer has a claim based on strict liability against the manufacturer. The manufacturer is liable even if the manufacturer did not know about the defect and even if the defect was present in the product when it was new. Because the consumer\u2019s claim is based on strict liability, the consumer does not need to prove negligence or defective workmanship. However, to prevail, the consumer must establish that the defect was a cause in fact of the injury. A cause in fact is a cause that sets in motion a sequence of events that brings about the injury. The consumer\u2019s expert testimony that the blender was defectively designed establishes that the defect was a cause in fact of the injury. The manufacturer\u2019s expert testimony that the blender was not defective is irrelevant to the cause in fact determination. Because the consumer\u2019s expert testimony establishes a prima facie case of defect, the manufacturer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should be denied. The manufacturer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict will be denied for the same reason that the consumer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict will be denied. A is incorrect. The consumer\u2019s inability to establish which of the two types of defect caused the injury does not defeat the consumer\u2019s claim. The consumer may not need to establish which of the two types of defect caused the injury, because the consumer\u2019s claim is based on strict liability. Furthermore, the consumer\u2019s inability to establish which type of defect caused the injury is not a sufficient reason to grant a directed verdict for the manufacturer. C is incorrect. Whether the blender was new when the jar shattered is irrelevant to the consumer\u2019s strict liability claim. The manufacturer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict will be denied for the same reason that the consumer\u2019s motion for a directed verdict will be denied.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

The law school had obtained all of the necessary municipal permits for the construction of the building, which included a large clock tower whose clock chimed every hour.

Although the person claiming nuisance may be in the minority, as is the case here, that person must be substantially affected by the conduct in order to prevail. Here, the plaintiff is abnormally sensitive to the chimes. While most people in the neighborhood are not disturbed by the chimes, the plaintiff is substantially affected by them. Therefore, the law school\u2019s erection of the clock tower and the chimes does not amount to a nuisance. A is incorrect. Although the person claiming nuisance must actually possess, or have a right of immediate possession to, the property, the person claiming nuisance need not be in the majority.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct.

Although the man did not directly observe the neighbor killing his cat, the neighbor knew that the man was nearby and in fact shot the cat in order to kill it. This is an intentional tort issue. Although most jurisdictions limit such recoverability to landlord-tenant relationships, the facts in this case demonstrate that the man and the neighbor had a sufficient relationship to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. A is incorrect because battery is a general intent crime and does not allow for vicarious liability. C is incorrect because the cat was owned by the man and the neighbor\u2019s actions caused harm to the man, not to the cat.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

A buyer gave the seller a signed handwritten offer to purchase the house. The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller\u2019s home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance. The buyer declared the contract voided by the fire, but the seller asserted a right to enforce the contract despite the loss. There is no applicable statute. If a court finds for the seller, what is the likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The contract was construed against the buyer, who drafted it.\nB. The lender\u2019s written commitment to make a mortgage loan to the buyer made the contract of sale fully binding on the\nbuyer.\nC. The risk of loss falls on the party in possession, and constructive possession passed to the buyer on the contract date.\nD.

A is incorrect because the contract is construed against the party who drafted it, but in this case, it was the buyer who drafted the contract.

The man received a loan, secured by a mortgage on the property, from a bank. Later, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank then brought an appropriate action to foreclose the mortgage, was the sole bidder at the judicial sale, and received title to the property as a result of the foreclosure sale. Shortly after the foreclosure sale, the man received a substantial inheritance.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The man's only option to regain title to the property after the foreclosure sale was to make a substantial payment to the bank in order to exercise an equitable right of redemption. To exercise an equitable right of redemption, the person seeking to redeem: 1) must make a substantial payment, 2) must make the payment no later than 12 months after the foreclosure sale, and 3) must make the payment to the person who held title to the property at the time of the foreclosure sale (in this case, the bank). Although the man did not make a substantial payment to the bank within the 12-month period after the foreclosure sale, he may prevail if he can show that he made the substantial payment within a reasonable time after the foreclosure sale. If the jurisdiction provides a statutory right of redemption, the time period for making a substantial payment is extended to the end of the statutory period. Thus, A, B, and D are all correct.

The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her. After the farmer promptly and properly recorded that deed, the second bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the farm. The farmer denied the validity of the second bank\u2019s mortgage. Does the second bank continue to have a valid mortgage on the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of estoppel by deed.\nB. Yes, because the original owner reacquired title to the farm.\nC. No, because the purchase at the foreclosure sale by the buyer under these facts eliminated the second bank\u2019s junior\nmortgage lien.\nD. No, because of the due-on-sale provision in the farmer\u2019s mortgage to the first bank.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Both mortgages were properly recorded. The due-on-sale provision in the farmer's mortgage to the first bank means that if the farm is sold, the entire amount of the mortgage debt is due and payable. Even if the second bank did not send a representative to the foreclosure sale, the presence of the buyer at the sale indicates that the farm was sold free and clear of the first bank's mortgage. Therefore, the second bank's mortgage was not entitled to priority and is therefore subordinate to the farmer's mortgage to the first bank. A is incorrect because estoppel by deed only applies when there is a conflict between the language of the deed and the accompanying mortgage, and there was no such conflict in this case. B is incorrect because the acquisition of title by the farmer does not eliminate the second bank's mortgage lien.

The contract stipulated that the seller would deliver to the buyer, upon the payment of the last installment due, \u201ca warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\u201d The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The buyer entered into possession of the land. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the buyer discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on the land, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25 percent of the purchase price that the buyer had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the seller had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the seller. The value of the land was then four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller\u2019s alleged breach of the contract.

The contract stated, \u201cThe parties agree that closing will occur on next May 1 at 10 a.m.\u201d There was no other reference to closing. The contract was silent as to quality of title. On April 27, the seller notified the buyer that she had discovered that the land was subject to a longstanding easement in favor of a corporation for a towpath for a canal, should the corporation ever want to build a canal. The buyer thought it so unlikely that a canal would be built that the closing should occur notwithstanding this outstanding easement.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The applicable zoning ordinance required that a buildable lot contain at least two acres and have frontage of not less than 100 feet on a public street. A brother and sister owned the land as tenants in common, the brother owning a one-third interest and the sister owning a two-thirds interest. Neither of them owned any other real property. The sister brought an appropriate action to partition the land and proposed that a two-acre rectangular lot with 100 feet of frontage be set off to her and that a one-acre rectangular lot with 50 feet of frontage be set off to the brother. The brother\u2019s defense included a demand that the land be sold and its proceeds be divided one-third to the brother and two-thirds to the sister. Who will prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The brother, because partition by sale is the preferred remedy, unless a fair price is not the likely result of a sale.\nB. The brother, because the zoning ordinance makes it impossible to divide the land fairly.\nC.

Where, as here, the subject property can be physically divided, a partition by sale is the preferred remedy unless a fair price is not the likely result of a sale. In this case, the subject property can be physically divided, and a sale is the preferred remedy. B is incorrect because the zoning ordinance is irrelevant to the determination of whether a physical division of the property is possible.

Thereafter, the city condemned approximately two-thirds of the land.

The appraisal was accurate. In an appropriate action among the landlord, the tenant, and the city as to the right of the tenant to a portion of the condemnation award, for whom will the court likely find?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landlord, because the condemnation superseded and canceled the lease.\nB. The landlord, because the parties specifically agreed as to the consequences of condemnation.\nC.

The colleague sued the niece for damages. For whom will the court find?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The colleague, because lack of access makes title unmarketable.\nB.

A marketable title is one that is free of encumbrances that are not explicitly identified in the purchase agreement.

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \u201cIt is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\u201d Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor\u2019s intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor\u2019s proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owners of lots in the subdivision own property benefitted by the original residential covenant and\nhave the sole right to enforce it.\nB. No, because the man owns property benefitted by the original restrictive covenant and has a right to enforce it.\nC. Yes, because the original restrictive covenant violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nD. Yes, because the zoning ordinance allows the doctor\u2019s proposed use and preempts the restrictive covenant.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The doctor can convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office because the original deed from the man to the developer violated the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP). The RAP applies to three types of interests: 1) vested remainders subject to open; 2) contingent remainders; and 3) executory interests. The rule dictates that where any of these interests would vest outside of a life in being plus 21 years, it is void. In this case, the restriction imposed by the man on the use of the 40-acre tract violated the RAP because the restriction will not vest for another 25 years. A is incorrect because the doctor, as a lot owner, is not a party to, nor beneficiary of, the restrictive covenant. Therefore, the doctor has no rights under, and is not entitled to enforce, the restrictive covenant. B is incorrect because the man is also subject to the restrictive covenant and, although he may be able to enforce it, he is not the only party who may enforce it.

The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nFive years ago, an investor who owned a vacant lot in a residential area borrowed $25,000 from a friend and gave the friend a note for $25,000 due in five years, secured by a mortgage on the lot. The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000. The buyer knew nothing of the friend\u2019s mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot. Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her bank of the mortgage claimed by the investor\u2019s friend, the bank loaned her $15,000, and she gave the bank a note for $15,000 due in two years secured by a mortgage on the lot. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. At that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cNo conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\u201d Both notes are now due and both the investor and the buyer have refused to pay. The lot is now worth only $50,000. What are the rights of the investor\u2019s friend and the bank in the lot?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both mortgages are enforceable liens and the friend\u2019s has priority because it was first recorded.\nB. Both mortgages are enforceable liens, but the bank\u2019s has priority because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for\nvalue.\nC. Only the friend\u2019s mortgage is an enforceable lien, because the bank had actual and constructive notice of the\ninvestor\u2019s fraud.\nD. Only the bank\u2019s mortgage is an enforceable lien, because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for value.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The recording statute identified in the facts is a race-notice statute. To prevail under a race-notice statute, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who: 1) was the first to record their deed (won the race) who also 2) acquired the land without notice of earlier purchasers. To be a BFP, a party must give value for their interest in the land. Both mortgages in this case are enforceable liens. The priority of the liens, however, depends upon whether the party holding the lien is a BFP. The facts indicate that the buyer was an innocent purchaser for value who obtained the deed without notice of the prior mortgage, so the bank\u2019s mortgage has priority. A is incorrect because the friend\u2019s priority in this case is not determined by the fact that he was the first to record his mortgage. Because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for value, the bank, and not the investor\u2019s friend, has priority. B is incorrect because the bank, not the buyer, is the BFP.

The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee\u2019s will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. The grantee\u2019s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might\nhave.\nC. The two tracts of land were not adjacent parcels of real estate, and thus the right to purchase is in gross and is\ntherefore unenforceable.\nD. Noncompliance with a right to purchase gives rise to a claim for money damages, but not for specific performance.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) applies to three types of interests: 1) vested remainders subject to open; 2) contingent remainders; and 3) executory interests. The rule dictates that where any of these interests would vest outside of a life in being plus 21 years, it is void. Answering RAP questions is best accomplished in two parts: 1) identify the type of interests created by the language of the deed, and 2) if the interest is one of the three that the RAP applies to, determine whether it would be possible for that interest to vest any later than twenty-one years after everyone alive at the time of the conveyance has died. If it could, the interest is void. In this case, the conveyance created a right of first refusal in favor of the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Because a right of first refusal is a contingent remainder, the Rule Against Perpetuities applies. It is possible for the right of first refusal to vest later than 21 years after everyone alive at the time of the conveyance has died. Therefore, the interest is void. A is incorrect because the conveyance did not violate the Rule Against Perpetuities. B is incorrect because a waiver does not avoid the application of the Rule Against Perpetuities.

In this case, the price for the purchase was to be set by three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers and was thus fair. The right, however, violates the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. The right to purchase is triggered by the decision of one to sell his or her land. In this case, that decision might occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the right was granted. Thus, under the common law, the right of first refusal is struck ab initio. The question notes that the common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in this jurisdiction.

The contractor was to earn a profit of $10,000 for the job. After the contractor had spent $45,000 on labor and materials, including $5,000 on oak flooring not yet installed, the homeowner informed the contractor that the homeowner had lost his job and could not pay for any services. The homeowner told the contractor to stop working immediately.

In the above case, the contractor is entitled to recover the reasonable value of the services he had provided up to the time of the owner's notice of breach, which was when the contractor had spent $45,000 on the job. Therefore, A is incorrect. B is incorrect. While the contractor may recover the reasonable value of his or her services, this does not include any profit that was earned.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. When the buyer received the seller\u2019s June 2 letter and the different computer model, but not the notice of accommodation, the buyer\u2019s remedies under the contract were determined by the UCC, which gives buyers a limited time to accept or reject conforming goods. The UCC also gives sellers who ship nonconforming goods the opportunity to accept the contract by promptly shipping conforming goods or giving notice of accommodation. When the buyer does not reject the goods and the seller ships nonconforming goods, the contract is accepted and the buyer is bound to pay for the goods. Because the buyer did not reject the goods, he is bound to pay for the different computer model. If the buyer rejects the goods, the seller must reship the correct goods or give notice of accommodation. If the seller fails to do either, the buyer may recover damages for breach of contract. Because the buyer is entitled to reject the goods, A and C are incorrect. D is incorrect because the notice of accommodation must be given promptly with the shipment of the nonconforming goods; the seller\u2019s notice of accommodation was timely mailed on June 2, and therefore, the seller\u2019s shipment of the different computer model on June 3 constituted a counteroffer that was not accepted by the buyer when he received the goods on June 5.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

Section 2-206(1)(b) also provides, however, that a contract calling for prompt shipment can be accepted by either a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt shipment of goods.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nOn March 1, an excavator entered into a contract with a contractor to perform excavation work on a large project. The contract expressly required that the excavator begin work on June 1 to enable other subcontractors to install utilities. On May 15, the excavator requested a 30-day delay in the start date for the excavation work because he was seriously behind schedule on another project. When the contractor refused to grant the delay, the excavator stated that he would try to begin the work for the contractor on June 1. Does the contractor have valid legal grounds to cancel the contract with the excavator and hire a replacement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the excavator committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract by causing the contractor to feel\ninsecure about the performance.\nB. Yes, because the excavator breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nC. No, because the excavator would be entitled to specific performance of the contract if he could begin by June 1.\nD. No, because the excavator did not state unequivocally that he would delay the beginning of his work.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. An anticipatory repudiation occurs when a party unequivocally manifests an intention not to perform or an inability to perform.

Restatement (Second) of Contracts, \u00a7 250 cmt. 0. B is incorrect because a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not a valid legal ground for canceling a contract. Such a breach may support a claim for damages, but it is not a sufficient reason in itself to justify a contract cancelation. C is incorrect because an award of specific performance is not available as a remedy for breach of contract where an award of monetary damages would be adequate to compensate the non-breaching party for the harm suffered. Specific performance is not available as a remedy where a party has committed only a partial breach of contract. D is correct. When the excavator stated that he would try to begin the work on June 1, he did not unequivocally manifest his intention not to perform, or an inability to perform.

The clerk\u2019s position would be terminated due to the dissolution, and he did not have a retirement plan. The accountant and the bookkeeper informed the clerk of their plan to fund an annuity for him. The clerk, confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity, purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100,000 to fund the annuity, but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50,000. The accountant agreed that the bookkeeper should contribute only $50,000. Does the clerk have a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the clerk was bound by the modification of the agreement made by the accountant and the bookkeeper.\nB. No, because the clerk was only a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper, and\nhad no vested rights.\nC. Yes, because the clerk\u2019s reliance on the promised retirement fund prevented the parties from changing the terms.\nD. Yes, because the promises to establish the fund were made binding by consideration from the clerk\u2019s many years of\nemployment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Generally, parties who make a contract for an intended beneficiary retain the right to modify the duty by a subsequent contract. However, where the intended beneficiary has relied on the promise and changed his position in reliance on the promise, the parties do not have the right to modify the duty. Although the clerk was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the accountant and the bookkeeper, he had no vested rights in the fund. Therefore, the parties could modify their duty with respect to the fund. However, because the clerk had relied on the promise and changed his position in reliance on the promise, the parties could not modify their duty with respect to the fund after the clerk had done so. A is incorrect because the clerk was not a party to the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper, and therefore, the modification to that agreement does not affect the rights of the clerk. D is incorrect because the promise to establish the fund was not consideration to support the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper.

On March 2, the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer\u2019s order was for a rush job, the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day\u2019s delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25,000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25,000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5,000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid, which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic\u2019s best defense to the textile company\u2019s action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Time was not of the essence in the contract between the mechanic and the textile company.\nB. The mechanic had no reason to foresee on March 1 that the customer would suffer consequential damages in the\namount of $25,000.\nC. By entering into the contract with the customer while knowing that its knitting machine was being repaired, the textile\ncompany assumed the risk of any delay loss to the customer.\nD. In all probability, the liquidated damages paid by the textile company to the customer are not the same amount as the\nactual damages sustained by the customer in consequence of the late delivery of the cloth.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under the doctrine of impossibility, where performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract, the obligation of a party is excused to the extent that performance is made impracticable. Although the mechanic is not excused for the delay in repairing the machine (which was within his control), the textile company is excused for the delay in delivery to the customer (which was not within its control). Therefore, the mechanic should not bear the entire burden of the delay, and a reasonable apportionment would be for the mechanic to bear 50% of the damages and the textile company to bear 50%. Thus, A is incorrect. C is incorrect. Pursuant to the doctrine of impossibility, the mechanic is not required to bear any of the damages caused by the delay. Therefore, it does not matter whether the customer\u2019s damage was foreseeable or not. D is incorrect. Whether the liquidated damages paid by the textile company to the customer are the same amount as the actual damages sustained by the customer is irrelevant in a suit among parties other than the original contracting parties.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

The buyer did not make the selection by March 1, and on March 2 the seller notified the buyer that because of the buyer\u2019s failure to select, the seller would not deliver the candy bars. The seller had all of the necessary candy bars on hand on March 1 and made no additional sales or purchases on March 1 or March 2. On March 2, after receiving the seller\u2019s notice that it would not perform, the buyer notified the seller of its selection and insisted that the seller perform. The seller refused. If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, is the buyer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a contract did not exist until selection of the specific candy bars, and the seller withdrew its offer before\nselection.\nB. No, because selection of the candy bars by March 1 was an express condition to the seller\u2019s duty to perform.\nC. Yes, because a delay of one day in making the selection did not have a material effect on the seller.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under the UCC, an order of goods for prompt shipment may be interpreted as inviting acceptance by a shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods. Where the contract requires the buyer to select the goods, however, the UCC rules impose a duty on the part of the seller to make a reasonable selection. Where the contract requires selection of specific goods, the buyer's failure to make a selection by the specified time is a breach of the contract that excuses the seller from performing. Although the seller's failure to make a selection by March 1 was a breach of the contract, the buyer's failure to make a selection by March 1 was not a material breach because selection of the candy bars was a condition that had to occur before the seller's duty to perform arose. A is incorrect because the offer did not lapse before selection; it merely became irrevocable after selection. C is incorrect because the buyer's failure to make a selection by March 1 was a material breach of the contract.
