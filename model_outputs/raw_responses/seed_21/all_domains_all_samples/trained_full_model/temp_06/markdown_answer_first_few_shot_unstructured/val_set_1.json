Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

In March, the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed. In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for that job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period as the summer camp. In a breach-of-contract action against the camp, to which of the following amounts, as damages, is the teacher entitled?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $4,000.\nB. $4,200.\nC. $10,000.\nD. $10,200.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

It is incorrect because it fails to provide for the teacher's lost wages from teaching in the local summer school, which is the only other available position that the teacher could have taken. B is incorrect. It is incorrect because it fails to provide for the teacher's expectation damages caused by the breach. D is incorrect.

The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier wrote the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed its latest audited financial statements to the supplier, as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the lumber supplier for breach of contract. Will the manufacturer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contract was unenforceable, since the manufacturer had not committed to purchase a definite quantity\nof lumber.\nB. No, because the supplier had reasonable grounds for insecurity and was therefore entitled to cancel the contract and\nrefuse to make any future deliveries.\nC. Yes, because the credit report and audited financial statements provided adequate assurance of due performance under\nthe contract.\nD. Yes, because the supplier was not entitled to condition resumption of deliveries on the receipt of financial status\ninformation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. A party to a contract with reasonable grounds to worry that the other party might not perform its obligations is entitled to condition resumption of performance on the other party's provision of adequate assurance of due performance. The supplier had reasonable grounds to worry that the manufacturer might not perform, since it had received no payment from the manufacturer and had heard rumors of the manufacturer's precarious financial condition. Therefore, the supplier properly conditioned resumption of deliveries on the receipt of adequate assurance. The audited financial statements and credit report constituted adequate assurance in these circumstances. The supplier's demand for assurance was not an unconscionable attempt to coerce the manufacturer into surrendering its rights under the contract, since the supplier was entitled to condition resumption of deliveries on the receipt of adequate assurance and the assurance that the manufacturer provided was substantial. A is incorrect. The parties did not contract for a definite quantity, but rather for an indefinite quantity. The fact that the contract was an indefinite quantity contract does not render it unenforceable, since courts will uphold indefinite quantity contracts so long as the parties have otherwise complied with the requirements for formation of a valid contract. B is incorrect. The supplier was not entitled to cancel the contract and refuse to make any future deliveries simply because it had reasonable grounds to worry that the manufacturer might not perform its obligations. The supplier was required to provide adequate assurance before it could justify its refusal to make any future deliveries. D is incorrect. The supplier was not entitled to condition resumption of performance on the receipt of financial status information.\n",

The dealer replied: \"It is a fine car and has been thoroughly inspected and comes with a certificate of assured quality. Feel free to have the car inspected by your own mechanic.\" In actuality, the car had been in an accident and the dealer had repaired and repainted the car, successfully concealing evidence of the accident. The buyer declined to have the car inspected by his own mechanic, explaining that he would rely on the dealer's certificate of assured quality. At no time did the dealer disclose that the car had previously been in an accident. The parties then signed a contract of sale. After the car was delivered and paid for, the buyer learned about the car's involvement in a major accident. If the buyer sues the dealer to rescind the transaction, is the buyer likely to succeed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the buyer had the opportunity to have the car inspected by his own mechanic and declined to do so.\nB. No, because the dealer did not affirmatively assert that the car had not been in an accident.\nC. Yes, because the contract was unconscionable.\nD. Yes, because the dealer's statement was intentionally misleading and the dealer had concealed evidence of the\naccident.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. A misrepresentation of fact that induces assent provides a basis for avoidance of a contract. A misrepresentation is defined as a statement that is not in accord with the facts. The dealer's statement that the car had not been in an accident is a misrepresentation of fact, since the car had in fact been in an accident. The dealer's statement was intentional and meant to induce the buyer to enter into the contract. Therefore, the buyer has a basis for avoiding the contract. A is incorrect. The buyer's mere failure to investigate the facts, even if the investigation would have revealed the true state of facts, does not constitute assent to the misrepresentation. The buyer's reliance on the dealer's representation that the car had not been in an accident is a tacit acceptance of the misrepresentation, but it is insufficient for the buyer to bear the risk of the misrepresentation. B is incorrect. The mere lack of affirmative disclosure of facts, even if the facts were true, does not amount to a misrepresentation of fact. The dealer did not affirmatively state that the car had not been in an accident, but he also did not state that it had been in an accident. There was no misrepresentation of fact by the dealer. C is incorrect. The contract may be unconscionable, but only if it is a contract of adhesion. A contract of adhesion is a contract that takes a party's consent by force, coercion, or duress. Although the buyer's consent to the contract is tainted by the misrepresentation, the contract is not a contract of adhesion. It is a bilateral contract that was entered into knowingly and voluntarily by both parties.\n",

The accident history of the car would be material to the decision of a buyer. The seller's statement, taken in context, and in light of the seller's active steps to conceal evidence of the damage and repair, would be the legal equivalent of a statement that the car had not been in an accident.

On March 1, the debtor requested a similar time extension and the creditor replied, \"Don't bother me each month. Just change the date of payment to the fifth of the month. But you must now make the payments by cashier's check.\" The debtor said, \"Okay,\" and made payments on March 5 and April 5. On April 6, the creditor sold the loan contract to a bank, but did not tell the bank about the agreement permitting payments on the fifth of the month. On April 6, the bank wrote to the debtor: \"Your debt to [the creditor] has been assigned to us. We hereby inform you that all payments must be made on the first day of the month.\" Can the debtor justifiably insist that the payment date for the rest of the installments is the fifth of each month?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a contract modification is not binding on an assignee who had no knowledge of the modification.\nB. No, because although the creditor waived the condition of payment on the first of the month, the bank reinstated it.\nC. Yes, because although the creditor waived the condition of payment on the first of the month, the creditor could not\nassign to the bank his right to reinstate that condition.\nD.

The seller correctly calculated that it would cost $8 to manufacture each set. Delivery was scheduled for 60 days later. Fifty-five days later, after the seller had completed production of the 1,000 sets, the buyer abandoned the project requiring use of the specially manufactured ball bearings and repudiated the contract with the seller.

When a buyer repudiates a contract, the seller may recover damages equivalent to the reasonable value of the benefit conferred and lost profits, plus any incidental damages. In the case, because the buyer repudiated the contract, the seller is entitled to recover damages equivalent to the difference between the cost of production ($8 per set) and the contract price ($10 per set), plus lost profits and incidental damages. A is incorrect. The salvage price is not a better indicator of market value than the contract price. B is incorrect. The lost profit is not the only indicator of damages available to the seller. C is correct. When a buyer repudiates a contract, the seller may recover damages equivalent to the reasonable value of the benefit conferred and lost profits, plus any incidental damages. In the case, because the buyer repudiated the contract, the seller is entitled to recover damages equivalent to the difference between the cost of production ($8 per set) and the contract price ($10 per set), plus lost profits and incidental damages.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

The chef agreed to take the position and to begin work in two weeks. In her employment application, the chef had indicated that she was seeking a permanent job. One week after the chef was hired by the bakery, a hotel offered the chef a position as a restaurant manager at a salary of $2,500 a month. The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery. Is the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a contract for permanent employment would be interpreted to mean the chef could leave at any time.\nB. No, because the position the chef took with the hotel was not substantially comparable to the one she had agreed to\ntake with the bakery.\nC. Yes, because the chef's acceptance of a permanent position meant that she agreed to leave the bakery only after a\nreasonable time.\nD. Yes, because the chef's failure to give the bakery a chance to match the salary offered by the hotel breached the\nimplied right of first refusal.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's obligation under a contract is conditioned upon the other party's substantial performance. However, where one party's performance requires a period of time (such as the chef's obligation to work for the bakery for two weeks), that performance is due before the other party's obligation is conditioned. Therefore, although the bakery's obligation to hire the chef was conditioned upon the chef's substantial performance (i.e., working for the bakery for at least two weeks), the chef's obligation to work for the bakery was not conditioned upon the bakery's substantial performance. Therefore, when the chef gave notice that she would not report for work at the bakery, she effectively repudiated her obligation under the contract and the bakery was entitled to damages caused by the breach. A is incorrect. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's obligation under a contract is conditioned upon the other party's substantial performance.

B is incorrect.

When the chef accepted the position with the hotel, she effectively repudiated her obligation under the contract and the bakery was entitled to damages caused by the breach. D is incorrect. The bakery does not have an implied right of first refusal because it is a contract of employment for a definite term.

The car dealer subsequently sold an automobile to a buyer at a price of $10,000, payable at $1,000 per month beginning on June 1. The car dealer then asked the bank whether the bank would accept payments of $1,000 per month for 10 months beginning June 1, without interest, in payment of the debt. The bank agreed to that arrangement and the car dealer then directed the buyer to make the payments to the bank. When the buyer tendered the first payment to the bank, the bank refused the payment, asserting that it would accept payment only from the car dealer. On June 2, the bank demanded that the car dealer pay the debt in full immediately. The car dealer refused to pay and the bank sued the car dealer to recover the $10,000. In this suit, which of the following arguments best supports the bank's claim for immediate payment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The agreement to extend the time for payment was not in writing.\nB. The car dealer could not delegate its duty to pay to the buyer.\nC. The car dealer gave no consideration for the agreement to extend the time of payment.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Although a party may delegate its duty under a contract to another party, it cannot delegate its duty to pay a debt without the other party's consent. There is no evidence that the bank agreed to the car dealer's attempt to assign its duty to pay the debt to the buyer. Therefore, the bank may refuse the buyer's attempts to pay the debt and sue the car dealer for the amount due. A is incorrect. The absence of a written agreement does not determine whether an obligation is personal or an obligation to pay money; it determines whether an obligation is enforceable at all. B is incorrect. Although a party generally cannot delegate its duty to pay a debt without the other party's consent, it can delegate its duty to pay a debt to a third party without the other party's consent if the party giving the duty has a good reason for assigning the duty and the third party provides consideration for the assignment. There is no indication that the car dealer provided any consideration for the bank's agreement to extend the time for payment. D is incorrect. Although a party may attempt to novate its duty under a contract to another party, the other party may reject the attempted novation if the other party has a substantial interest in the original contract.

In performing each contract, the seller delivered the grain to the buyer and, upon delivery, the buyer signed an invoice that showed an agreed upon price for that delivery. Each invoice was silent in regard to any discount from the price for prompt payment. The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery. In all of their prior transactions and without objection from the seller, the buyer took 15 days to pay and deducted 5% from the invoice price. The same delivery procedure and invoice were used in the present contract as had been used previously. The present contract called for a single delivery of wheat at a price of $300,000. The seller delivered the wheat and the buyer then signed the invoice. On the third day after delivery, the buyer received the following note from the seller: \"Payment in full in accordance with signed invoice is due immediately. No discounts permitted.\" s/Seller. Which of the following statements concerning these facts is most accurate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The custom of the trade controls, and the buyer is entitled to take a 2% discount if he pays within 10 days.\nB. The parties' course of dealing controls, and the buyer is entitled to take a 5% discount if he pays within 15 days.\nC. The seller's retraction of his prior waiver controls, and the buyer is entitled to no discount.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The Uniform Commercial Code controls, and it defines a trade usage that can modify a contract as a trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it. The fact that the buyer and the seller have dealt with each other in hundreds of separate grain contracts over the last five years, and that the buyer has taken a 5% discount from the invoice price for payment in 15 days in all of those transactions, supports an inference that the parties contracted with reference to the 5% 15-day discount. A is incorrect. The statute controls, and it defines a trade usage that can modify a contract only if that usage is observed with sufficient regularity so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it. The facts state that the buyer and the seller have dealt with each other in hundreds of separate grain contracts over the last five years, but they do not show that the parties contracted with reference to the 2% 10-day discount. Therefore, the statute does not support an inference that the parties contracted with reference to the 2% 10-day discount. C is incorrect. The seller's retraction of his prior waiver of the 2% 10-day discount does not control because it occurred after the parties entered into their written contract. Under the UCC, a trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it can modify a written contract, but only if the usage occurs before the parties enter into a written contract. D is incorrect. The written contract controls, but it does so because it is a written contract to which the parol evidence rule does not apply. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the writing or where the prior agreement purports to add to the writing. In this case, the prior agreement (the trade usage) does not contradict the written contract; rather, it attempts to modify the written contract. Under the UCC, a trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it can modify a written contract, but only if the usage occurs before the parties enter into a written contract. Because the written contract here is silent as to any discount and because the usage (the 2% 10-day discount) occurred before the parties entered into the written contract, the usage can modify the written contract.\n",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

Before the instruction was to begin, the tutor repudiated the contract. Although the mother or the son reasonably could have employed, for $6,000, an equally qualified instructor to replace the tutor, neither did so. The son failed the bar exam and the law firm refused to employ him. It can be shown that had the son received the instruction, he would have passed the bar exam. If the mother and the son join as parties plaintiff and sue the tutor for breach of contract, how much, if anything, are they entitled to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $1,000, because all other damages could have been avoided by employing another equally qualified instructor.\nB. $55,000, because damages of that amount were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they contracted.\nC. Nominal damages only, because the mother was not injured by the breach and the tutor made no promise to the son.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. A contract claimant is entitled to recover only those damages which could not reasonably have been avoided. Here, the mother and the son did not take any reasonable steps to avoid the consequences of the tutor's breach. Therefore, they are only entitled to a nominal damages award, if anything. A is incorrect. While it is true that the mother and the son could have employed another equally qualified instructor to replace the tutor, doing so would not have avoided the consequences of the tutor's breach. Therefore, damages of that amount would not be a reasonable measure of the tutor's liability. B is incorrect. While it is true that damages of that amount were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they contracted, recovering only what was within the contemplation of the parties is insufficient to constitute a breach as having caused actual damages. C is incorrect. While it is true that the tutor made no promise to the son, the mother's promise to pay the tutor $5,000 in exchange for the tutor's services to the son is a sufficient basis for a parent-child relationship to support the mother's promise to pay the tutor $55,000 in the event the son passed the bar exam.\n",

Each structure was distinct from the other two and the parties agreed on a specific price for each. After completing the first structure in accordance with the terms of the contract, the builder demanded payment of the specified price for that structure. At the same time, the builder told the landowner that the builder was \"tired of the construction business\" and would not even begin the other two structures. The landowner refused to pay anything to the builder. Is the builder likely to prevail in a suit for the agreed price of the first structure?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because substantial performance is a constructive condition to the landowner's duty to pay at the contract rate.\nB. No, because the builder's cessation of performance without legal excuse is a willful breach of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the contract is divisible, and the landowner will be required to bring a separate claim for the builder's\nfailure to complete the other two structures.\nD. Yes, because the contract is divisible, but the landowner will be able to deduct any recoverable damages caused by the\nbuilder's failure to complete the contract.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Contract law acknowledges the fact that parties sometimes embody obligations which are in most respects separable into a single document or agreement. The rules for damages permit the separable components to be treated separately, which is appropriate here since the structures were to be built on separate pieces of land owned by the landowner. Although normally a party who has partially breached a contract is entitled only to recover damages measured by the difference between the value of the performance actually rendered and the value of the performance the non-breaching party is entitled to receive, the breaching party will be precluded from recovering any damages at all if its repudiation is material. A repudiation is considered material if it has a substantial effect on the value of the performance due. Here, the builder's cessation of performance is a willful repudiation since the builder knew that continuing performance was expressly conditioned upon the landowner's payment of the specified price for each structure. Therefore, the builder will be precluded from recovering any damages at all. Since the structures were to be built on separate pieces of land, they should be considered separable and divisible. This means that the landowner will be able to bring a claim for the builder's failure to complete the first structure, and recover damages for that breach, but that the landowner will not be able to recover damages for the builder's failure to complete the other two structures (since those structures were also separable and divisible). In addition, since the damages for the builder's failure to complete the first structure will be determined by the market value of the first structure, any recoverable damages will be reduced by the amount of the builder's damages, if any.

The uncle replied that he would lend the money to the nephew only if the nephew's mother \"guaranteed\" the loan. At the nephew's suggestion, the uncle then telephoned the nephew's mother, told her about the loan, and asked if she would \"guarantee\" it. She replied, \"Surely. Lend my son the $4,000 and I'll repay it if he doesn't.\" The uncle then lent $4,000 to the nephew, an amount the nephew orally agreed to repay in six weeks.

The buyer was unable to do so, but did obtain a loan at an interest rate of 10.5% and timely tendered the purchase price. Because the value of the land had increased since the time of contracting, the seller refused to perform. The buyer sued the seller. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because an express condition will only be excused to avoid forfeiture.\nB. No, because the contract called for a loan at an interest rate not to exceed 10% and it could not be modified without\nthe consent of the seller.\nC. Yes, because the buyer detrimentally changed position in reliance on the seller's promise to convey.\nD. Yes, because the buyer's obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10% was not a condition to the seller's duty\nto perform.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. A duty of performance becomes absolute when conditions precedent are either met or excused. A duty of performance is subject to conditions subsequent when the duty is conditioned upon the happening of a subsequent condition. The seller's duty to convey the parcel of land to the buyer was subject to an express condition precedent--that the buyer obtain a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10%. The fact that the express condition (a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10%) was not met does not automatically render the seller's duty absolute. Instead, the non-occurrence of the condition simply means that the seller's duty is conditioned upon the happening of a subsequent condition (the buyer obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10%). The subsequent condition of obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10% must also be either met or excused before the seller's duty to convey will become absolute. Because the buyer was unable to obtain a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10%, the express condition was excused and the seller's duty to convey became absolute. A is incorrect. The mere fact that an express condition may avoid forfeiture does not mean that the condition will always be enforced. Whether an express condition will be enforced depends upon whether the condition relates to a material term of the contract and whether the party seeking exemption from the condition detrimentally relied on the promise. Here, obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10% was a condition relating to a material term of the contract (the purchase price) and the buyer detrimentally relied on the seller's promise to convey by entering into the contract. Therefore, the express condition should be enforced. B is incorrect. The fact that the contract called for a loan at an interest rate not to exceed 10% and it could not be modified without the consent of the seller does not determine whether the condition will be enforced. Whether the condition will be enforced depends upon whether the condition relates to a material term of the contract and whether the party seeking exemption from the condition detrimentally relied on the promise. C is incorrect.

No, because the parties attached materially different meanings to \"daily service,\" and, therefore, no contract was\nformed.\nC. Yes, because the parol evidence rule will not permit the innkeeper to prove the meaning she attached to \"daily\nservice.\"\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Under the doctrine of trade usage, where parties attached materially different meanings to the same\nmaterial term, the meaning that controls is that attached by the party that has applied the term in a consistent\nmanner so as to establish a trade usage. Therefore, because the parties attached different meanings to the term\n\"daily service,\" and because the laundry company's consistent use of the term established a trade usage, the meaning\nattached by the laundry company will control. A is incorrect. The meaning that controls is that attached by the party\nthat has applied the term in a consistent manner so as to establish a trade usage, not the meaning that controls in\nlight of a party's particular knowledge or understanding. Therefore, it does not matter whether the innkeeper\nattached a different meaning to the term or whether the laundry company knew that the innkeeper attached a\ndifferent meaning to the term. B is incorrect. Although the parties may attach different meanings to the same term,\nwhere one party's meaning controls under the doctrine of trade usage, there is no requirement that both parties\nattach different meanings for the trade usage to apply. C is incorrect. The parol evidence rule does not prohibit\nthe introduction of evidence to establish a trade usage that contradicts the meaning of a written agreement.\n",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The statute is a tax, and as such, it is subject to the limitations on taxation found in Article I, Section 8. That limitation on taxation only applies to direct taxes, but for the purposes of this question, it is irrelevant whether this is a direct or an indirect tax. The limitation on taxation also applies to taxes that impair the obligation of contracts. As a tax, this statute raises revenue that will be spent on the purchase of computer software. The funds for that purchase, however, will come from the tax on the sale of new computers. Therefore, the statute impairs the value of the software companies' licenses, which are their property. A is incorrect. Although the tax may be a direct tax in the sense that it is paid by the person who owns the computer rather than by some third party, it is not a tax on a person's income. It is a tax on the sale of a product. C is incorrect. Although this spending may promote the general welfare, the tax itself is a tax on the sale of a product rather than a tax on income. Moreover, the tax does not bear a rough proportion to the general welfare benefit. D is incorrect. The patent power does not give Congress the power to tax.

It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside Green, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in Green. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in Green. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in Green. The Green legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of Green from faulty science and to protect Green toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in Green of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in Green satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the Green law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it abrogates the obligations of the contracts between the other toy manufacturers and their Green outlets\nwho have agreed to sell their Martian toys.\nB. No, because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because it deals only with a local matter, the sale of toys in Green stores.\nD.

A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate against the out-of-state toy manufacturers, it has a purely discriminatory effect against them, and the state has less discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate interests cited in the law.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The child testified while she was seated behind one-way glass, which allowed the defendant to see the child but did not allow the child to see the defendant. The defendant appealed to the state supreme court claiming that the inability of the witness to see the defendant while she testified violated both the United States Constitution and the state constitution. Without addressing the federal constitutional issue, the state supreme court reversed the defendant's conviction and ordered a new trial. The state supreme court held that \"the constitution of this state is clear, and it requires that while testifying in a criminal trial, a witness must be able to see the defendant.\" The state petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. On which ground should the United States Supreme Court DENY the state's petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. A state may not seek appellate review in the United States Supreme Court of the reversal of a criminal conviction by\nits own supreme court.\nB. The decision of the state supreme court was based on an adequate and independent state ground.\nC.

The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not require that a witness against a criminal defendant be able to see the defendant while the witness testifies. The Supreme Court of the state could find the state constitution to have a stronger guarantee than the Sixth Amendment, and that its own decisions overturning criminal convictions based on violations of the state constitution must be given effect. A is incorrect. The state may seek appellate review in the United States Supreme Court of the reversal of a criminal conviction by its own supreme court, although it must do so within a limited time after the state supreme court's decision. B is incorrect. The decision of the state supreme court may be based on an adequate and independent state ground, but the Supreme Court of the United States may still review that decision if it raises a substantial federal question.

Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was \"to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats\" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser sued the county, claiming that the regulation has taken the purchaser's property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the county did not take title to the property from the purchaser.\nB. No, because the regulation has not caused or authorized any uninvited physical invasion or intrusion onto the property.\nC. Yes, because the conservation objective of the county ordinance is not sufficiently compelling to justify the substantial\ndiminution in the property value.\nD.

No, because a 48-hour waiting period is excessively long and, therefore, it imposes an undue burden on a woman's\nright to procure an abortion.\nB. No, because the state law does not provide a bypass procedure that would allow a court to authorize a minor to obtain\nan abortion without prior parental notification under appropriate circumstances.\nC. Yes, because parents' rights to supervise their minor daughter's health care outweighs any individual right she may\nhave.\nD.

The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

Can the man constitutionally be convicted under this law?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because he was only communicating his views and had not commenced any overt action against the neighbors.\nB. Yes, because he was engaged in trespass when he painted the words on his neighbors' house.\nC. Yes, because his communication was a threat by which he intended to intimidate his neighbors.\nD.

The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice.\nB. No, because murder is a specific intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that they intended to kill.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice does not require the intent to kill; in some cases, there may be \"implied malice\" if there was gross or extreme recklessness to human life on the part of the defendant. Additionally, voluntary intoxication is insufficient to negate criminal responsibility, since the gang members were voluntarily intoxicated and knew that the informant was going to be stabbed and killed. The gang members are guilty of murder. A is incorrect. Mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient for accomplice liability. However, the gang members are guilty of murder, and thus not accomplices to murder. B is incorrect. Murder is not a specific intent crime; it can be committed recklessly or with implied malice.

She went back inside and told her husband what she had seen. Without alerting anyone, they took their son and left. Some 20 minutes later, the bomb exploded, killing eight persons and injuring 50. In the jurisdiction, murder in the first degree is defined as an intentional homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation; murder in the second degree is defined as all other murder at common law; and manslaughter is defined as either a homicide in the heat of passion arising from adequate provocation or a homicide caused by gross negligence or reckless indifference to consequence. As to the deaths of the eight persons, what crime, if any, did the wife commit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Manslaughter.\nB. Murder in the first degree.\nC. Murder in the second degree.\nD. No crime.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The wife is charged with manslaughter, the killing of a human being in the heat of passion provoked by adequate provocation. The facts state that the wife saw the man placing the bomb and that she believed that a bomb was present. Although the husband and wife should have alerted the authorities of the bomb and not walked away, the couple was not committing a felony murder, because felony murder is the killing of a human being during the commission of a violent felony, and placing a bomb against a wall is insufficiently violent to constitute a violent felony. The wife is not guilty of murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree because she did not have the requisite mental state for either crime. The wife is not guilty of felony murder because the crime she is charged with is manslaughter and not murder. The wife is guilty of manslaughter because she killed the eight persons in the heat of passion provoked by her belief that the man was placing a bomb against a wall. The wife could not control her passion and lacked the mental state necessary for murder. B is incorrect. The wife is charged with manslaughter, not murder in the first degree. Murder in the first degree requires the intentional killing of another human being with premeditation and deliberation. The wife did not intend to kill the eight people; in fact, she was attempting to save her own life by getting her family away from the bomb. The wife is not guilty of murder in the second degree because she did not have the requisite mental state for murder in the second degree. C is incorrect. The wife is charged with manslaughter, not murder in the second degree. Murder in the second degree requires the intentional killing of another human being during the commission of a violent felony. The wife did not intentionally kill the eight people; in fact, she was attempting to save her own life by getting her family away from the bomb.

She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant.

The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer.

A court might well grant such a motion in this case, but only as to the second set of photographs. The woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer without his permission (and, under the stipulation, without probable cause) probably did violate the federal interception statute, and that statute grants a remedy for such violations that is broader than the one provided by the Fourth Amendment.

If you do not do exactly what I tell you, he will shoot you. Put all the money from the register into a sack and give it to me when I drive up.\" The clerk did not see anyone across the street and was unsure whether anyone was there. However, unwilling to risk harm to himself, he put $500 in a paper bag and handed it to the woman when she drove up to the delivery window. The woman drove off with the money but was arrested a short time later. She had lied about the man with a rifle and had acted alone.

Robbery or larceny.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The woman committed larceny or robbery, but not both. Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of his interest in the property. Robbery is the taking of personal property of another from the other's person by force or intimidation with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. There is no evidence that the clerk was intimidated by the woman, so the woman's actions would not constitute robbery. The woman's statement that there was a man with a rifle and that he would shoot the clerk if he did not hand over the money is sufficient evidence to prove the intent to permanently deprive the clerk of his interest in the money. The woman lied about the presence of the man with a rifle, so she committed larceny by false pretenses. However, false pretenses is a subset of larceny and does not constitute a separate crime, so A is incorrect. The woman's actions qualify as both larceny and robbery, so B and C are incorrect.\n",

In conversation with the clerk, the customer falsely claimed to be the son of the mayor. When handed the watch, he asked if he could put it on, walk around a bit so he could see how it felt on his wrist, and then briefly step outside to observe it in natural light. The clerk agreed, saying, \"I know I can trust someone like you with the merchandise.\" The customer walked out of the store wearing the watch and never returned. A week later, the clerk was at a gathering when she spotted the customer wearing the watch. She told him that he must either pay for the watch or give it back. He hissed, \"I'll knock your block off if you mess with me.\" Intimidated, the clerk backed off. The following list of crimes is in descending order of seriousness. What is the most serious crime the customer committed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Robbery.\nB. Larceny.\nC. False pretenses.\nD. Embezzlement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The most serious crime the defendant committed is larceny. He took and carried away the watch with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, and without the owner's permission. The fact that the clerk was deceived into allowing the customer to take the watch makes the crime of larceny even more egregious, and supports the finding that the customer had the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the watch. A is incorrect because the customer did not commit a robbery. Robbery is defined at common law as the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. The customer's conduct does not fit this definition. The customer never used force or the threat of force on the clerk, and he did not have the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the watch. The customer's lies were intended to get the clerk to let her guard down so that he could take the watch and run off with it. At common law, larceny is defined as the taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. The customer's lies were intended to get the clerk to let her guard down so that he could take the watch and run off with it. The customer's conduct fits the definition of larceny, and is thus more serious than the customer's robbery. C is incorrect because false pretenses is not the most serious crime the defendant committed. False pretenses is defined as obtaining possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation while intending to permanently deprive the owner of the property. The customer lied to the clerk to obtain possession of the watch, and intended to permanently deprive the owner of the watch. However, false pretenses is a less serious crime than larceny. D is incorrect because the customer did not commit embezzlement. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of another person's property by someone who has lawful possession of said property. The customer did not convert the watch, nor did he have lawful possession of it. The clerk was the owner and had lawful possession of the watch. The customer obtained possession of the watch through fraud and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, and is thus guilty of larceny.\n",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landlord leased an apartment to a tenant by written lease for two years ending on the last day of a recent month. The lease provided for $700 monthly rental. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term, until he moved to a new job in another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his \"lease rights\" for the remaining nine months of the lease. The friend made the next four monthly $700 rental payments to the landlord. For the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left of the lease term. The landlord was on an extended trip abroad, and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until last week. The landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally, for $3,500 for the last five months' rent. What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the tenant and the friend are liable for the full $3,500, because the tenant is liable on privity of contract and the\nfriend is liable on privity of estate as assignee.\nB. The friend is liable for $1,400 on privity of estate, which lasted only until he vacated, and the tenant is liable for\n$2,100 on privity of contract and estate for the period after the friend vacated.\nC. The friend is liable for $3,500 on privity of estate and the tenant is not liable, because the landlord's failure to object to\nthe friend's payment of rent relieved the tenant of liability.\nD. The tenant is liable for $3,500 on privity of contract and the friend is not liable, because a sublessee does not have\npersonal liability to the original landlord.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The landowner handed the instrument to the friend, saying, \"This is yours, but please do not record it until after I am dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives.\" Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed. The friend said that he would destroy the deed and a day or so later falsely told the landowner that the deed had been destroyed. Six months ago, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestate, survived by a daughter as his sole heir at law. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him. As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land. For whom should the court hold?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter, because the death of the landowner deprived the subsequent recordation of any effect.\nB.

A valid judicial foreclosure proceeding was held, in which the creditor, the aunt, and the debtor were named parties. A dispute arose as to which lien has priority.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. This is a race-notice jurisdiction which protects a bona fide purchaser for value who recorded his or her deed first. Although the debtor's mortgage to his aunt was promptly and properly recorded, the creditor's judgment lien predates it, having been filed two years earlier. Although the aunt did not conduct a title search before making the loan, she would still have been bound by the race-notice provision of the jurisdiction's law, since she recorded her mortgage after the creditor filed its judgment. Therefore, the creditor's judgment lien has priority over the aunt's mortgage lien. A is incorrect. Although a judgment lien is subordinate to a mortgage lien in general, this is a race-notice jurisdiction, which protects a bona fide purchaser for value who recorded his or her deed first. Therefore, the fact that the aunt's mortgage is senior to the creditor's in general is irrelevant. B is incorrect. Although a purchase money mortgage is generally given priority over a subsequent judgment lien, this is a race-notice jurisdiction, which protects a bona fide purchaser for value who recorded his or her deed first.

The investor made the installment payments on the mortgage regularly for several years. Then the investor persuaded a neighbor to buy the land, subject to the mortgage to his partner. They expressly agreed that the neighbor would not assume and agree to pay the investor's debt to the partner. The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating in pertinent part \" . . . , subject to a mortgage to [the partner],\" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage. The neighbor took possession of the land and made several mortgage payments, which the partner accepted. Now, however, neither the neighbor nor the investor has made the last three mortgage payments. The partner has sued the neighbor for the amount of the delinquent payments. In this action, for whom should the court render judgment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The neighbor, because she did not assume and agree to pay the investor's mortgage debt.\nB. The neighbor, because she is not in privity of estate with the partner.\nC. The partner, because the investor's deed to the neighbor violated the due-on-sale clause.\nD. The partner, because the neighbor is in privity of estate with the partner.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. This is a reading comprehension question and requires you to understand the meaning of the terms \"due-on-sale\" clause and \"subject to a mortgage.\" A due-on-sale clause is a clause in a mortgage that states that if the mortgagor transfers his or her interest in the land without the mortgagee's consent, then the entire principal balance of the debt secured by the mortgage becomes due and payable. Ownership of the land is in privity of estate with the mortgagee, and a breach of the due-on-sale clause is a violation of this privity. Therefore, C is correct, and B is incorrect. B is incorrect because it ignores the meaning of the terms \"due-on-sale\" clause and \"subject to a mortgage.\" Although it is true that the neighbor is not in privity of estate with the partner, this fact has nothing to do with whether the neighbor is liable for the mortgage debt. The neighbor is liable because she violated the due-on-sale clause, which is a privity-related provision.\n",

For the past nine years, the rancher has impounded on her land the water that resulted from rain and melting snow, much of which flowed from the farmer's land. The rancher uses the water in her livestock operation. Recently, the farmer increased the size of his farming operation and built a dam on his land near the boundary between the two tracts. Because of the dam, these waters no longer drain from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. There is no applicable statute. The rancher sued the farmer to restrain him from interfering with the natural flow of the water onto her land. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The farmer, because he has the right to use all of the water impounded on his land.\nB. The farmer, because the rancher's past impoundment of water estops her from asserting the illegality of the farmer's\ndam.\nC.

The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance. How should the $200,000 surplus arising from the bid on the parking garage be distributed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It should be paid to the bank.\nB. It should be paid to the businessman.\nC. It should be paid to the financing company.\nD. It should be split equally between the bank and the financing company.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The bank and the financing company both have liens on the parking garage, and both have equal priority. The bank's lien has been foreclosed, but the financing company's lien was not, because its mortgage balance was lower than the net proceeds of the foreclosure sale. As stated in the facts, there is no statute or other provision that gives priority to the bank's lien. Therefore, the $200,000 surplus should be paid to the financing company. A is incorrect because the bank is entitled to no more than its pro rata share of the surplus. B is incorrect because the businessman has no interest in the surplus, and no one has the right to claim it on his behalf. D is incorrect because the bank and the financing company do not have to split the surplus equally.\n",

(The bank may have decided on this course of action because it deemed the businessman's equity in the garage was significant and the timing was bad for a hotel foreclosure.) After the financing company was paid in full from the funds generated by the foreclosure sale of its mortgage on the parking garage, the additional funds generated by that sale would be paid to the bank not as a deficiency judgment, but because of the unsatisfied amount of the prior money judgment.",

The recorded subdivision plan imposed no restrictions on any of the 10 lots. Within two months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to a buyer, by a deed that contained no restriction on the lot's use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner, on behalf of himself as the owner of the unsold lot, and on behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on Lot 1. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The doctor, because Lot 1 was conveyed without the inclusion of the restrictive covenant in the deed to the first buyer\nand the subsequent deed to the doctor.\nB. The doctor, because zoning ordinances override private restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.\nC. The landowner, because the doctor, as a successor in interest to the first buyer, is estopped to deny that Lot 1 remains\nsubject to the zoning ordinance as it existed when Lot 1 was first conveyed by the landowner to the first buyer.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct.

The contract made no mention of the quality of title to be conveyed. Thereafter, the seller and the investor completed the sale, and the seller delivered a warranty deed to the investor. Soon thereafter, the value of the land increased dramatically. The investor entered into a written contract to sell the land to a buyer. The contract between the investor and the buyer expressly provided that the investor would convey a marketable title. The buyer's attorney discovered that the title to the land was not marketable, and had not been marketable when the original seller conveyed to the investor. The buyer refused to complete the sale. The investor sued the original seller on multiple counts.

Further, in establishing whether an encumbrance exists with regard to local codes or ordinances, it is important to distinguish between building codes and zoning laws. A property being in violation of the building code is not considered an encumbrance, and title to that building is marketable.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA buyer validly contracted in writing to buy land from a seller. The contract had no contingencies and was silent as to risk of loss if there were damage to, or destruction of, property improvements between contract and closing, and as to any duty to carry insurance. As soon as the parties signed the contract, the seller (who had already moved out) canceled her insurance covering the land. The buyer did not know this and did not obtain insurance. A few days later, three weeks before the agreed closing date, the building on the land was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. There is no applicable statute. In an appropriate action, the buyer asserted the right to cancel the contract and to recover his earnest money. The seller said the risk of fire loss passed to the buyer before the fire, so the buyer must perform. If the seller prevails, what is the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Once the parties signed the contract, only the buyer had an insurable interest and so could have protected against this\nloss.\nB. The buyer's constructive possession arising from the contract gave him the affirmative duty of protecting against loss\nby fire.\nC. The seller's cancellation of her casualty insurance practically construed the contract to transfer the risk of loss to the\nbuyer.\nD. Upon execution of the contract, the buyer became the equitable owner of the land under the doctrine of equitable\nconversion.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Although jurisdictions differ on which party has the risk of loss, a finding for the seller in this case would indicate that the jurisdiction hearing the case places the risk of loss on the equitable owner of the property, the buyer, under the doctrine of equitable conversion. Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss is placed on the equitable owner of the property, who is entitled to the fruits of the land. As soon as the parties signed the contract, the seller (who had already moved out) canceled her insurance covering the land. The buyer did not know this and did not obtain insurance. Therefore, as of the time of contract signing, the risk of loss lay with the buyer, and he became equitably entitled to the land under the doctrine of equitable conversion. Thus, C is correct, and B is incorrect. B is incorrect because it states that the buyer constructedively possessed the land. Although this may be true, it is irrelevant for determining which party bears the risk of loss. A is incorrect because it states that only the buyer had an insurable interest.

The woman accepted the deed without conducting a title search and promptly and properly recorded her deed. The woman is the owner of the land and the nephew must give her back the $10,000. A is incorrect. At the time of the deed to the woman, the record title was in the uncle, not the nephew. The woman's failure to conduct a title search is irrelevant to this fact. B is incorrect.

The woman had objected to the district's plans for the stadium and was particularly upset about nighttime athletic events that attracted large crowds and that, at times, resulted in significant noise and light intensity levels. On nights of athletic events, the woman and her family members wore earplugs and could not sleep or enjoy a quiet evening until after 10 p.m. In addition, light from the stadium on those nights was bright enough to allow reading a newspaper in the woman's yard.

Waste.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The woman is seeking damages for the substantial and unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property caused by the school district's actions. The doctrine of private nuisance is a general claim for damages available to a property owner whose use and enjoyment of his or her land is substantially and unreasonably interfered with by a second party's actions. A private nuisance action does not require that the actions that cause the harm be intentional; they may be negligent or reckless so long as they are substantial and unreasonable. The facts clearly demonstrate that the actions of the public school district are a substantial and unreasonable interference with the woman's use and enjoyment of her land. The woman is entitled to a jury trial on her claim for damages for private nuisance. A is incorrect because the actions of the public school district did not actually or constructively deprive the woman of physical possession of her land. Instead, the woman was merely distressed and annoyed by the activities of the school district. C is incorrect because the actions of the public school district did not cause a substantial and unreasonable public nuisance. In fact, the activities of the school district were in the nature of a public benefit, and any burden it caused was a secondary effect. D is incorrect because the woman has not shown that the actions of the public school district caused a total destruction or waste of any part of her land.

At a sidebar conference, the defendant's lawyer sought permission to ask the plaintiff about two prior intersection accidents in the last 12 months where he received traffic citations for failing to stop at stop signs. The plaintiff's lawyer objected. Should the court allow defense counsel to ask the plaintiff about the two prior incidents?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions does not bear on the plaintiff's veracity and does not\ncontradict his testimony in this case.\nB. No, because there is no indication that failing to stop on the recent occasions led to convictions.\nC. Yes, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions bears on the plaintiff's credibility, since he claims to\nhave stopped in this case.\nD.

The officer, after looking at it, was prepared to testify that he recalled that the defendant admitted to being in the area of the burglary. The defendant objected to the officer's testimony on the ground that it violated the \"original document\" rule (also known as the \"best evidence\" rule).

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAt a civil trial for slander, the plaintiff showed that the defendant had called the plaintiff a thief.

Although evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, there is an exception that allows the accused to offer evidence of a trait of character that is pertinent to the trial. In this case, because the defendant is asserting that the plaintiff is a thief, the defendant should be allowed to offer evidence that the plaintiff has a bad reputation in the community for thievery.

            "explanation": "In slander cases, where the defendant makes a statement that the plaintiff has an unsavory character, the plaintiff's character is considered \"in issue\" (i.e., an essential element of the claim or defense under the substantive law) in two respects: First, the plaintiff's actual character will determine whether the defendant was incorrect in his assessment, and thus liable for slander, because truth is a defense. Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched; but if the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character and to the extent of damages.

Yes, under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The doctor's letter is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff's condition is caused by her work. Thus, the letter is hearsay, and it is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements for any exception to the hearsay rule. B is incorrect. It is irrelevant whether the physician is available or not for the purposes of the hearsay rule. The letter is still being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff's condition is caused by her work - and it should be found to be inadmissible. C is incorrect. Although it may be that the expert relied upon the doctor's letter in forming his opinion, the probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. As a general rule, hearsay that is not admissible as substantive evidence cannot be used to impeach an expert. D is incorrect. Although the letter may be business records, it is still being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff's condition is caused by her work - and it should be found to be inadmissible.

In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case.

The rule bars suits by emergency responders who are injured while responding to emergencies arising out of the conditions they confront. Here, the facts state that the police officer was injured in the accident while she was returning from an emergency call. Thus, A is correct. B is incorrect.

During the course of the construction, there had been many thefts of tools and equipment from the construction area. One night, the construction company's employees neglected to place warning lights around the trench. A delivery truck drove into the trench and broke an axle. While the delivery driver was looking for a telephone to summon a tow truck, thieves broke into the delivery truck and stole $350,000 worth of goods. The delivery company sued the construction company to recover for the $350,000 loss and for $1,500 worth of damage to its truck. The construction company stipulated that it was negligent in failing to place warning lights around the trench, and admits liability for damage to the truck, but denies liability for the loss of the goods. On cross-motions for summary judgment, how should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny both motions, because there is evidence to support a finding that the construction company should have realized\nthat its negligence could create an opportunity for a third party to commit a crime.\nB. Grant the construction company's motion, because no one could have foreseen that the failure to place warning lights\ncould result in the loss of a cargo of valuable goods.\nC. Grant the construction company's motion, because the criminal acts of third persons were a superseding cause of the\nloss.\nD.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA consumer became physically ill after drinking part of a bottle of soda that contained a large decomposed snail. The consumer sued the store from which she bought the soda to recover damages for her injuries. The parties agreed that the snail was put into the bottle during the bottling process, over which the store had no control. The parties also agreed that the snail would have been visible in the bottle before the consumer opened it. Will the consumer prevail in her action against the store?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the consumer could have seen the snail in the bottle.\nB. No, because the store was not responsible for the bottling process.\nC. Yes, because the consumer was injured by a defective product sold to her by the store.\nD. Yes, because the store had exclusive control over the bottle before selling it to the consumer.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. This is a products liability issue. The store is responsible for any defects in the soda that cause harm to a user, as it is the seller of the product. The consumer opened the bottle, which allowed the decomposed snail to enter her system and make her ill. This is a design defect case. The store designed the bottle, which allowed the snail to enter it. It is likely that any reasonable designer would have known that a decomposed snail could enter the bottle. Therefore, the store is responsible for the harm to the consumer. A is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the consumer could have seen the snail. If it were that easy to determine whether a product was dangerous, there would be no products liability law. B is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the store had no control over the bottling process. It is the store's bottle, and it is the store that is responsible for any defects in the product. D is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the store had exclusive control over the bottle before selling it to the consumer. It is the store's bottle, and it is the store that is responsible for any defects in the product.\n",

The fact that the peel is fresh and clean except for the mark made by the customer's shoe shows that the customer was the cause of the mark and that the grocer did not place the peel there.

It is possible that the customer was not aware of the peel and slipped without fault. Furthermore, even if the customer was negligent, he would not be liable for the harm he caused because he was not the cause of the foreign substance on the floor. C is incorrect. It is not clear that the peel came from a banana that was offered for sale by the grocer. It is possible that the peel was dropped by a customer or employee of the grocer.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. This is a pure comparative negligence question. The issue is not whether the child was negligent, but whether the day care center was negligent. To prevail in a negligence action, the child must show that the day care center failed to exercise due care, which was the standard of care exercised toward all of its charges at the time of the incident. The facts indicate that the day care center was fully staffed with qualified personnel and was taking reasonable steps to ensure that the children in their care did not leave the premises. Therefore, C is correct, and A and B are incorrect.\n",
