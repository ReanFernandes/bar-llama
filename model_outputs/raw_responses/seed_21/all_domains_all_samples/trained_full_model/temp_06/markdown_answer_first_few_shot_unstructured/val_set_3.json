The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA homeowner was using a six-foot stepladder to clean the furnace in his home. The homeowner broke his arm when he slipped and fell from the ladder. The furnace had no warnings or instructions on how it was to be cleaned. In a suit by the homeowner against the manufacturer of the furnace to recover for his injury, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the danger of falling from a ladder is obvious.\nB. No, because the homeowner should have hired a professional to clean the furnace.\nC. Yes, because the furnace did not have a ladder attached to it for cleaning purposes.\nD. Yes, because the lack of warnings or instructions for how to clean the furnace made the furnace defective.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The homeowner is a plaintiff in a defective design case. The manufacturer of the furnace failed to warn of a danger that was not obvious to a person of ordinary intelligence who was using the furnace. The homeowner fell from the ladder while cleaning the furnace, which is an intended use of the furnace. Therefore, the furnace's lack of warning constituted a defect that caused the homeowner's injuries. A is incorrect. The danger of falling from a ladder may not be obvious to a person who was not aware of it, which is why the homeowner fell. B is incorrect. Hiring a professional to clean the furnace would not absolve the manufacturer of its duty to warn of a danger that its furnace posed. C is incorrect. The lack of a ladder does not make the furnace defective. It is simply an absence of a feature that would make using the furnace safer.\n",

Vehicles made by the manufacturer of the motorist\u2019s car have been found to be negligently designed, making them dangerously prone to rolling over when they suffer blowouts. A truck driver who was driving behind the motorist when the accident occurred stopped to help. Rescue vehicles promptly arrived, and the truck driver walked along the side of the road to return to his truck. As he approached his truck, he was struck and injured by a speeding car. The truck driver has sued the manufacturer of the injured motorist\u2019s car. Is the truck driver likely to prevail in a suit against the car manufacturer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the car manufacturer\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of the truck driver\u2019s injuries.\nB. No, because the truck driver assumed the risk of injury when he undertook to help the motorist.\nC. Yes, because it is foreseeable that injuries can result from rollovers.\nD. Yes, because the car manufacturer\u2019s negligence caused the dangerous situation that invited the rescue by the truck\ndriver.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The car manufacturer designed a negligently dangerous car, and by doing so, set in motion a series of events that caused the truck driver to be injured. The truck driver was not merely a bystander, but a rescuer who was trying to help the motorist. A rescuer who is injured while attempting to save someone from harm is generally not deemed to be a mere bystander, and therefore not be liable for the rescuer's injuries. The truck driver's suit against the car manufacturer is likely to prevail, because the car manufacturer set the events in motion that caused the truck driver's injuries. A is incorrect. The proximate cause of the truck driver's injuries was the negligence of the car manufacturer. The fact that the truck driver was a rescuer is not a superseding cause of the truck driver's injuries. B is incorrect. While it is true that the truck driver might have assumed the risk by attempting to rescue the motorist, the car manufacturer did not owe the truck driver a duty to protect him from harm because the truck driver was a mere bystander. However, as explained above, the truck driver was not a mere bystander, and thus not owe the truck driver a duty to rescue him. C is incorrect. While it is true that the rollover may have been foreseeable, it was not a certainty, and therefore it cannot be the basis for a finding of negligence. The car manufacturer could not be expected to design the car so that it would prevent a rare occurrence.\n",

The landowner had his own home and a mini-golf business on his property. In a nuisance action against the gas company, the landowner established that the refinery emitted fumes that made many people feel quite sick when they were outside on his property for longer than a few minutes. The landowner\u2019s mini-golf business had greatly declined as a consequence, and the value of his property had gone down markedly. Is the landowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the landowner has offered no evidence demonstrating that the gas company was negligent.\nB. No, because the refinery conforms to the zoning requirements.\nC. Yes, because the refinery has substantially and unreasonably interfered with the landowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of his\nproperty.\nD. Yes, because the value of the landowner\u2019s property has declined.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Private nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with another\u2019s use or enjoyment of property. The facts indicate that people are leaving the landowner\u2019s property after being exposed to the fumes for longer than a few minutes. This means that the fumes are substantially interfering with the use and enjoyment of the landowner\u2019s property. The person claiming nuisance does not need to be the one suffering the invasion, so long as the person can show that the invasion is substantial and unreasonable. A is incorrect. The fact that there may be no negligence at all does not mean that the invasion will not be a nuisance. In a private nuisance action, a plaintiff does not need to show negligence. B is incorrect. While this may be a defense to a public nuisance claim (see answer D), it will not be a defense to a private nuisance claim. Any substantial, unreasonable interference with another\u2019s use or enjoyment of property is a nuisance, whether or not it conforms to local zoning requirements. D is incorrect. While a substantial, unreasonable interference with another\u2019s use or enjoyment of property may give rise to a claim for public nuisance (see answer D), it will also give rise to a claim for private nuisance, as explained above.\n",

The defendant did not intentionally start the fire, and the plaintiff can produce no evidence as to how the fire started. However, the defendant had failed to install a sprinkler system, which was required by a criminal statute. The plaintiff can produce evidence that had the sprinkler system been installed, it could have extinguished the fire before it spread. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant to recover for the fire damage, is it possible for the plaintiff to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the statute provides only for criminal penalties.\nB. No, because there is no evidence that the defendant negligently caused the fire to start.\nC. Yes, because a landowner is strictly liable for harm to others caused by the spread of fire from his premises under the\ndoctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The defendant is liable for the harm to the plaintiff\u2019s property and for the plaintiff\u2019s consequential damages resulting from the defendant\u2019s violation of the statute. A statute that is meant to protect against a particular type of occurrence is similar to an industry standard, and both give rise to the presumption of negligence. The defendant\u2019s failure to install a sprinkler system is a violation of a statute that is meant to protect against the spread of fire, and therefore, the defendant is liable for the harm to the plaintiff\u2019s property and for the consequential damages resulting from this violation. A is incorrect. The fact that the statute provides only for criminal penalties does not negate the potential civil liability that might arise from the violation of the statute. B is incorrect. There is no negligence or proximate cause requirement for strict liability cases. Although negligence might be a factor in determining damages, it is not the determining factor in whether the defendant will be held liable. C is incorrect. While the case of Rylands v. Fletcher might support the finding of strict liability in this case, it is not the only case that supports finding the defendant liable.

The nurse, a paid employee of the facility who was trained to care for schizophrenic patients, was injured. The patient is an indigent whose care is paid for by the government. The jurisdiction generally follows the rule that a person with a mental deficiency is held to the standard of a reasonable person.

The patient\u2019s attorney will argue that the patient should not be held responsible for the nurse\u2019s injury because the patient did not act with malice. The fact that the patient was in an institution and was being treated for schizophrenia is the least helpful to the patient\u2019s argument. A person who is acting under a mental illness and who is being treated for it may not be held criminally liable for actions directly attributable to the mental illness.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA farmer kept antiques in an uninhabited farmhouse on his property. The farmhouse had been broken into several times in the past, and some of the farmer\u2019s goods had been stolen. Instead of posting \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, the farmer decided to install an alarm system to deter intruders. While the farmer was in the farmhouse installing the alarm system, he heard a window open in the adjoining room. The farmer crept very quietly to the door of the room, threw the door open, and found an intruder, a young child. The farmer immediately struck the child, a 10-year-old girl, very hard in the face, breaking her nose. In an action on behalf of the child against the farmer to recover for the injury to her nose, is the child likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the farmer did not use deadly force.\nB. No, because the farmer had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief.\nC. Yes, because the farmer should have posted a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign.\nD. Yes, because the farmer used excessive force.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. While the farmer might have had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief and could have used deadly force, the fact that the farmer used his fist to attack the child suggests that he was enraged and could not tell the difference between a child and an adult. These facts support a finding of malice on the part of the farmer. Since the child was a mere bystander and not a thief, the farmer's actions in attacking her will support a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim by the child. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect. The child does not need to show that the farmer used deadly force to prevail in her claim. The farmer's actions in attacking the child were sufficient to support a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Since the farmer was not in imminent danger of harming himself, and since he could have deterred the intrusion by posting a sign, the farmer's actions were negligent. Thus, A is incorrect. B is incorrect. The farmer does not need to show that he had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief to prevail in her claim. The farmer's actions in attacking the child were sufficient to support a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Since the farmer was not in imminent danger of harming himself, and since he could have deterred the intrusion by posting a sign, the farmer's actions were negligent. Thus, B is incorrect. C is incorrect. While posting a \"No Trespassing\" sign might have deterred the intrusion and thus prevented the injury, it would not have been a sufficient intervening act to allow the farmer to escape liability. The farmer's actions in attacking the child were sufficient to support a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Since the farmer was not in imminent danger of harming himself, and since he could have deterred the intrusion by posting a sign, the farmer's actions were negligent. Thus, C is incorrect.\n",

No, because the rancher suspected that the neighbor was armed.\nC. Yes, because deadly force is never appropriate in a property dispute.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. While the rancher's belief that deadly force was necessary to protect himself from harm may have been actual, it was not reasonable. To justify the use of force sufficient to cause death or serious bodily injury, a defendant must have more than a subjective suspicion that he himself is threatened with harm. He must have a reasonable belief that he is threatened with harm as a result of unlawful force. In this case, the rancher's belief that the neighbor was armed was not reasonable, nor did he have a reasonable belief that he was threatened with harm as a result of unlawful force. A is incorrect. The majority of states require that a person who is attacked in a populated area have no obligation to retreat before using deadly force. However, the rancher was not in a populated area and there is no indication that the neighbor was advancing toward the rancher with the intent to do him harm. Therefore, the rancher should be required to retreat before using deadly force. B is incorrect. While it is possible that the rancher could properly use deadly force in self-defense, it is not likely.

In this case, the patient has produced evidence that establishes that the applicable professional standard of care was violated.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The pharmacy filled the prescription with a product that was not fit for its intended use. By not following the prescription, the pharmacy substantially changed the risk-utility balance of the product, making it defective. The man suffered an injury as a result of taking the defective product. Therefore, the pharmacy is liable for the damages caused by the defective product. A is incorrect. While it is true that pharmacies are not strictly liable for injuries caused by incorrectly filled prescriptions, this is a special rule for pharmacies.

Rent was to be paid by the first day of each month, and the tenant paid the first month\u2019s rent at the time of the agreement. When the tenant arrived at the leased premises on July 1, the tenant learned that the previous tenant had not vacated the premises at the end of her lease term on May 31 and did not intend to vacate. The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession. The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. By suing the previous tenant for possession, the tenant elected that remedy in lieu of a suit against the landlord.\nB. The landlord had delivered the legal right of possession to the tenant.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct.

The tenant did not fail to vacate as required to sue for constructive eviction. The tenant was not in the legal right of possession due to the previous tenant's unauthorized occupancy.

One week after the cousin\u2019s birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin\u2019s inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise. The investor considered suing the cousin but realized that she could not compel the cousin to convey the farm because it was still owned by the man. Two weeks after the cousin\u2019s birthday, the man died. Under his valid will, the man devised the farm to the cousin. Within a week, the executor of the man\u2019s estate gave the cousin an executor\u2019s deed to the farm in compliance with state law. The investor promptly learned of this transfer and demanded that the cousin convey the farm to her. The cousin refused. The investor sued the cousin for specific performance.

The lender promptly recorded the mortgage. A year later, the landowner conveyed the same tract to a developer by a deed that expressly stated that the conveyance was subject to the mortgage to the lender and that the grantee expressly assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage obligation as part of the consideration for the purchase. The mortgage was properly described in the deed, and the deed was properly executed by the landowner; however, because there was no provision or place in the deed for the developer to sign, he did not do so. The developer promptly recorded the deed. The developer made the monthly mortgage payments of principal and interest for six payments but then stopped payments and defaulted on the mortgage obligation. The lender properly instituted foreclosure procedures in accordance with the governing law. After the foreclosure sale, there was a $10,000 deficiency due to the lender.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The developer cannot be held liable simply because he accepted delivery of the deed from the landowner. To be bound by a contract, a party must sign the contract. In the absence of a contrary rule of law, a contract that requires a party to sign to be bound is unenforceable. Although the landowner\u2019s deed expressly provided that the developer was bound to pay the mortgage obligation, the developer did not sign the deed. Therefore, he cannot be held liable for the deficiency. A is incorrect. Accepting a deed does not automatically bind a party to the contractual terms. In the absence of a contrary rule of law, a contract that requires a party to sign to be bound is unenforceable. Although the landowner\u2019s deed expressly provided that the developer was bound to pay the mortgage obligation, the developer did not sign the deed. Therefore, he cannot be held liable for the deficiency. B is incorrect. Making six monthly payments to the lender does not estop the developer from not being liable for the deficiency. Estoppel applies only where there is a bargained-for exchange and where one party detrimentally relies on the other party\u2019s conduct. Although the developer detrimentally relied on the landowner\u2019s conduct by making six monthly payments to the lender, there was no bargained-for exchange between the developer and the landowner. The developer made the payments without any consideration from the landowner. D is incorrect. The developer can be held liable for the deficiency, in addition to the landowner, because he accepted delivery of the deed from the landowner and in so doing accepted the terms and conditions of the deed. Although the developer did not sign the deed, he is liable for the landowner\u2019s debt as a guarantor. A guarantor is liable for the debt of a third party, in this case the landowner, if the guarantor signed a contract that provided for a guaranty.

The man, as a tenant in common, validly transferred his undivided interest in the tenancy to the tenant by a lease for a term of years. The tenant must, but is not required to, share the right of possession with the sister and the cousin. In this case, the man had a one-third interest to transfer, so a three-year lease is appropriate. If the man had a five-eighths interest to transfer, a five-year lease would be appropriate.

The tenant must, but is not required to, share the right of possession with the sister and the cousin.

The nephew\u2019s daughter immediately claimed ownership of the farm and demanded that the attorney deliver the deed to her. Must the attorney deliver the deed to the daughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a gratuitous death escrow is void unless supported by a written contract.\nB. No, because the man never placed the deed beyond his control.\nC. Yes, because the death of the nephew rendered the gratuitous death escrow irrevocable by the man.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. When the man delivered the deed to his attorney with instructions to deliver it to the nephew on his death, he was attempting to create a valid death escrow.

Because the man instructed the attorney to return the deed to the man if he asked, the man never placed the deed beyond his control, and it remained part of his estate after his death.

There is no requirement that a gratuitous death escrow be supported by a written contract. In any event, the man's email to the nephew was sufficient to create a valid death escrow. C is incorrect. The death of the nephew did not make the death escrow irrevocable by the man because it was already void.

Twenty years ago, the businesswoman conveyed the vacant tract to a grantee by a warranty deed that the businesswoman signed but the grantee did not. The deed contained a covenant by the grantee as owner of the vacant tract that neither he nor his heirs or assigns would \u201cerect any building\u201d on the vacant tract, in order to preserve the view of the river from the commercial building on the improved tract. The grantee intended to use the vacant tract as a nature preserve. The grantee promptly and properly recorded the deed. Last year, the businesswoman conveyed the improved tract to a businessman. A month later, the grantee died, devising all of his property, including the vacant land, to his cousin. Six weeks ago, the cousin began construction of a building on the vacant tract. The businessman objected and sued to enjoin construction of the building. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The businessman, because the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project.\nB. The businessman, because the cousin is bound by the covenant made by the grantee.\nC. The cousin, because an equitable servitude does not survive the death of the promisor.\nD. The cousin, because the grantee did not sign the deed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The businesswoman and the grantee created a valid equitable servitude. An equitable servitude is a restriction on the use of a particular piece of land that is imposed on a specific tract of land and that benefits another tract of land. The businesswoman and the grantee's deed met the requirements for creating an equitable servitude--the businesswoman promised to impose a restriction on the vacant tract, and the grantee promised to benefit from the restriction. The businesswoman and the grantee's deed also met the requirements for execution and delivery of a deed--the businesswoman signed it, and the deed was promptly and properly recorded. The cousin is bound by the equitable servitude imposed by the businesswoman and the grantee, and he cannot build a structure on the vacant tract. A is incorrect. The businessman may not base his claim against the cousin on the mere fact that the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project. While the fact that the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project may provide some evidence that the cousin is bound by the equitable servitude, it is not a sufficient basis on its own for the businessman's claim. C is incorrect. Although an equitable servitude does not survive the death of the promisor, in this case the businesswoman and the grantee created an equitable servitude benefiting the businessman, not the businesswoman. Therefore, the businesswoman's death had no effect on the cousin's obligations under the deed. D is incorrect. The businesswoman and the grantee's deed was executed and delivered properly, so it is a valid conveyance that creates an equitable servitude, not a contract.\n",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The statute of frauds requires a writing evidencing an agreement to sell real property to identify the land to be sold.

In this case, the writing fails to meet the statute of frauds requirements because it does not indicate the exact location or dimensions of the tract of land to be sold. B is incorrect. Although the purchase price is not determinable under the terms of the contract, that is not the only requirement that must be met for a contract for the sale of real property to be specifically enforceable. To be enforceable, the contract must also meet the statute of frauds requirements.

A neighbor who owned the property immediately adjacent to the land wrongfully began to possess the land at that time. For 24 of the next 25 years, the neighbor planted and harvested crops on the land, hunted on it, and parked cars on it. However, in the sixth year after he first took possession of the land, the neighbor neither planted crops nor hunted nor parked cars on the land because he spent that entire year living in Europe. The neighbor built a small gardening shed on the land, but he never built a residence on it. When the daughter was 28, she was declared mentally incompetent and had a conservator appointed to oversee her affairs. Since then, she has continuously resided in a care facility. The applicable statute of limitations provides as follows: \u201cAn ejectment action shall be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues, but if the person entitled to bring the cause of action is under age 18 or mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues, it may be brought by such person within 10 years after attaining age 18 or after the person becomes competent.\u201d If the daughter\u2019s conservator wins an ejectment action against the neighbor, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter was age 17 when the neighbor first took possession of the land.\nB. Because the daughter is mentally incompetent, the statute of limitations has been tolled.\nC. The neighbor never built a residence on the land.\nD. The neighbor was not in continuous possession of the land for 21 years.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The statute of limitations for an ejectment action is 21 years, except where the person bringing the action is mentally incompetent, in which case it is 10 years. Because the daughter is mentally incompetent, the statute of limitations has been tolled, and she has 10 years from the time she becomes competent to bring the action. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the conservator winning the ejectment action is that the neighbor has not continuously possessed the land for the 21- or 10-year period. A is incorrect. Although it is true that the daughter was a minor when the neighbor first took possession of the land, the statute of limitations does not run until the cause of action accrues, which in this case would be when the neighbor first took possession of the land. Therefore, it makes no difference that the daughter was a minor at that time. B is incorrect. The statute of limitations for an ejectment action has not been tolled simply because the daughter is mentally incompetent. Rather, the statute of limitations has been tolled until the daughter becomes competent. C is incorrect. It is true that a failure to build a residence on the land might be used as evidence that the neighbor never actually possessed the land, but it would be used as evidence of the neighbor\u2019s lack of possession, not as the cause of action having accrued.

The buyer purchased a title insurance policy running to both the buyer and the bank, showing no liens on the property other than the buyer\u2019s mortgage to the bank. Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances. As a result of a title examiner\u2019s negligence, this mortgage was not disclosed in the title insurance policy issued to the buyer and the bank. Following this discovery, the donee successfully sued the buyer to recover the amount of the outstanding mortgage. If the buyer sues the title insurance company to recover the amount he paid to the donee, is he likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the buyer conveyed the land to an investor.\nB.

Six months ago, the city validly revised its zoning ordinances and placed the woman\u2019s lot and the surrounding lots abutting the public street from the north in a zone limited to residential use; the lots abutting the public street on the south side were zoned for both residential and light business use. The woman asked the city\u2019s zoning appeals board to approve her proposal to operate a court-reporting service from her house. This type of use would be permitted on the south side of the public street and, in fact, one such business has existed there for several years. The board approved the woman\u2019s proposal. Why?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. A variance was granted.\nB. The doctrine of amortization applied.\nC. The doctrine of change of circumstances applied.\nD. The woman\u2019s use of her house was a nonconforming use.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. A variance permits a waiver from a zoning requirement. A variance will be granted when an owner convinces a zoning appeals board that without the variance the owner would suffer a hardship regarding the use of the land. In this case, the board approved the woman\u2019s proposal to operate a court-reporting service in her house. This use of the land would be permitted on the south side of the public street and, in fact, one such business has existed there for several years. The woman\u2019s use of her house as a residential and business combination is a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use is a use of a structure or land that does not conform to the current zoning ordinance but continues uninterrupted for a period of time. Although the zoning ordinance was later revised to prohibit businesses on the north side of the public street, the woman\u2019s use of her house as a residential and business combination is considered a nonconforming use because it existed before the revision of the zoning ordinance. Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect because a variance is not at issue in this question. B is incorrect because there was no change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the zoning. C is incorrect because the doctrine of change of circumstances does not apply to zoning.\n",

Her will did not specify the duties of the husband and the niece with regard to maintenance and expenses related to the farm. The husband took sole possession of the farm, did not farm the land, and did not rent the land to a third person, although the fair rental value was substantial. For two years in a row after the woman died, the county assessor sent the tax bills to the niece, but the niece did not pay the bills, because she and the husband could not agree on who should pay them. Finally, the niece paid the taxes to avoid a tax foreclosure sale. The niece then sued the husband for reimbursement for the two years\u2019 worth of property taxes. There is no applicable statute.

Although a remainderman is responsible for the payment of property taxes, the facts indicate that the woman\u2019s will created a life estate for the husband with the remainder to the niece. The husband was only entitled to a life estate in the farm, which means that he had a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste relevant to the property. It also means that he was only entitled to the income from the farm and was not the sole occupant. Therefore, it was not clear that the husband was to be the sole party responsible for the payment of property taxes. B is incorrect.

Several years later, she executed a mortgage on the lot to a bank to secure repayment of a $100,000 loan. Subsequently, the woman executed a mortgage on the same four-acre lot to a finance company to secure repayment of a $50,000 loan. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. The woman recently defaulted on both loans. The bank promptly initiated foreclosure proceedings and sent proper notice to all necessary parties. The current fair market value of the four-acre lot is $250,000. The finance company has filed a timely motion in the foreclosure proceeding asking the court to require the bank to first foreclose on two of the four acres in the four-acre lot. The bank opposes this motion and insists that it has the right to subject the entire four-acre lot to the foreclosure sale. Will the court grant the finance company\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the bank holds a purchase-money mortgage.\nB. No, because the entire four-acre lot is subject to the bank\u2019s senior mortgage.\nC. Yes, because a pro rata foreclosure of the lot will not prejudice the rights of the bank.\nD.

The son, because a personal representative can remove only trade fixtures from real property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The man and the wife created a life estate and a vested remainder. The wife had a right to annex a chattel, which is a chandelier, to the land. The wife\u2019s right to annex a chattel ended with her death, and the nephew has a right to annex a chattel (the chandelier) to the land. The nephew\u2019s right to annex a chattel ends with the death of the man\u2019s son. The man\u2019s son has a vested remainder and an equal right with the nephew to annex a chattel to the land. The chandelier can be legally removed within a reasonable time after the death of the wife. The period of time after which the nephew could reasonably be expected to remove the chandelier is the life expectancy of the man plus 21 years (the wife\u2019s age at the time of conveyance plus the man\u2019s age at the time of conveyance plus 21 years).

Although the state has not identified any particular propaganda that it considers seditious, the term is sufficiently vague to chill protected speech. Because the state has not given a content-neutral definition of seditious propaganda, the law fails intermediate scrutiny and is unconstitutional. A is incorrect because a bill of attainder is a legislatively-imposed punishment that singles out particular individuals for punishment without a judicial proceeding; bills of attainder are explicitly prohibited by Article I, Section 10, Clause 1. The statute at issue here is a general statute that is neutral as to the content of speech it prohibits. B is incorrect because the statute is not vague. Although the terms \"seditious\" and \"propaganda\" are vague, when read in conjunction with one another, they are not vague. C is incorrect because the U.S. Post Office is a federal instrumentality that is part of the executive branch of the federal government.

In an advertisement promoting sales of a particular drug, a drug company claimed that the drug was safe for children.

At the time the child took the drug, the available medical studies supported the company\u2019s claim that the drug was safe for children, but later research proved that the drug actually was harmful to children. The company has moved to dismiss the suit on First Amendment grounds. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because false or misleading commercial speech is not constitutionally protected.\nB. No, because the drug business is subject to extensive health and safety regulation.\nC. Yes, because liability cannot be imposed for false statements without a showing of actual malice.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. U.S. Supreme Court precedent establishes that false or misleading commercial speech may be restricted without violating the First Amendment as long as the restriction is a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of commercial speech that is designed to protect a substantial interest in promoting a compelling public policy. The restriction must be a reasonable fit to serve that compelling public policy interest, and it must leave open alternative channels of communication sufficient to make the message known. The drug business is subject to extensive health and safety regulation to protect the public from unsafe and misleading products. Claims that a prescription drug is safe are a matter of public concern that are subject to heightened scrutiny because false or misleading commercial speech in this area impacts the public's health. However, because the drug company made the false claim in an advertisement rather than in the labeling of the drug, as required by FDA regulations, the restriction would be a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of commercial speech that serves a compelling public policy interest and leaves open alternative channels of communication. Thus, A is correct, and B is incorrect. C is incorrect. The drug company does not need to show actual malice to avoid liability under this statute.

According to the terms of the federal statute, the first national achievement test was scheduled for administration five years from the effective date of the statute. After reviewing then-current levels of public school student performance, the officials of a state became concerned that several of its public school districts would lose their federal funding after the administration of the first national achievement test. Then-current levels of private school student performance were substantially higher. In order to improve the chances of those school districts retaining their federal funding, the state recently enacted a law that requires all children of elementary and secondary school age to attend the schools operated by their respective local public school districts. The law is to take effect at the beginning of the next school year. Parents of children enrolled in private schools within the state have filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of this state law. Should the court uphold the law?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nB. Yes, because it is necessary to further a compelling state interest.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest because there is a reasonable fit between the general welfare, as Congress understands it, and the legislation.

Moreover, a statute that is rationally related to a legitimate state interest may be applied uniformly to all members of the class of persons upon which it is imposed, regardless of whether the application is actually necessary to advance a compelling state interest.

B is incorrect. A statute that is rationally related to a legitimate state interest may be applied uniformly to all members of the class of persons upon which it is imposed, regardless of whether the application is actually necessary to advance a compelling state interest.

This exception to the ordinance was adopted in response to local citizens\u2019 strong views about proposed rezoning of residential neighborhoods. A group that wished to picket in front of a business owner\u2019s home because of the business owner\u2019s employment practices challenged the ordinance as unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Will the group\u2019s challenge likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the ordinance is a content-neutral regulation of speech.\nB. No, because the ordinance regulates conduct rather than speech.\nC. Yes, because the ordinance irrationally discriminates between different types of protesters.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The ordinance classifies between different types of protesters based on the content of their speech. The ordinance permits picketing about zoning requirements but prohibits picketing about other topics. A court therefore would likely strike down the ordinance as a content-based restriction of speech in violation of the First Amendment. A is incorrect because the ordinance is not a content-neutral regulation of speech. Such a regulation would be valid if it was narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest, but the ordinance would be invalid in this case because the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest and it irrationally discriminates between different types of protesters. B is incorrect because the ordinance regulates conduct rather than speech. Such a regulation would be valid if it was narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest, but the ordinance would be invalid in this case because the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest and it irrationally discriminates between different types of protesters.

The express purpose of the law is to safeguard the supply of water for state citizens. Adoption of this state law followed enactment of a federal statute providing that \u201cthe transport of groundwater from one state to another may be restricted or prohibited in accordance with the laws of the state in which the water originates.\u201d An association of water users in a neighboring state has filed suit to have the state law declared unconstitutional and enjoined on the ground that it violates the negative implications of the commerce clause. Which of the following is the best argument supporting a motion to dismiss the lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The law promotes a compelling state interest that outweighs any burden on interstate commercial activity that might\nresult from this state regulation of its groundwater.\nB. Groundwater located within a state is not itself an article of interstate commerce, and therefore state regulation of the\nwithdrawal of such groundwater does not implicate the commerce clause.\nC. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states plenary authority over the regulation of the natural resources located\nwithin their respective borders.\nD. The federal statute explicitly consents to a state\u2019s regulation of its groundwater in a way that would otherwise violate\nthe negative implications of the commerce clause.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Under the supremacy clause, a valid federal law that unconditionally invites a state to regulate in a certain way implicitly consents to that regulation even if it would otherwise violate the commerce clause. The federal statute inviting states to restrict or prohibit the transport of groundwater from one state to another qualifies as such an invalid federal law. Therefore, it implicitly consents to state regulation that would otherwise violate the commerce clause, and the state may continue to regulate its groundwater as it has been. A is incorrect. While a state may regulate its natural resources in ways that would otherwise violate the commerce clause, a state only has plenary power over such resources within its own borders. The state does not have power over these resources once they leave its territory. Therefore, the best argument in support of a motion to dismiss this suit is that the suit is not ripe. B is incorrect. While it is true that groundwater located within a state is not itself an article of interstate commerce, the fact that the water may flow across state lines impacts the analysis. C is incorrect. While the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states plenary power over natural resources located within their respective borders, the power is not absolute.

Without discovering the water damage or the leaking roof and without consulting a lawyer, the buyer immediately agreed in writing to buy the home for $200,000. Before the closing date, the buyer discovered the water damage and the leaking roof. The cost of repair was estimated at $22,000. The buyer has refused to go through with the purchase. If the homeowner sues the buyer for breach of contract, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because no contract was formed since the buyer did not have a real opportunity to understand the essential terms\nof the contract.\nB. No, because the homeowner concealed evidence of the water damage and of the leaking roof.\nC. Yes, because the homeowner made no affirmative statements of fact about the water damage or the leaking roof.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. A misrepresentation of fact that induces assent provides a basis for avoidance or damages. A misrepresentation is defined as a statement that is not in accord with the facts. Affirmative conduct that is \"intended or known likely to prevent another from learning a fact is equivalent to an assertion that the fact does not exist.\" The homeowner's painting over the water damage constituted affirmative conduct intended to prevent the buyer from learning of the damage, and is equivalent to an assertion that the damage does not exist. Therefore, the homeowner made a misrepresentation of fact that induced the buyer's assent, and the buyer has a basis for avoiding the contract or recovering damages. A is incorrect. The buyer was not induced to enter into the contract by a misrepresentation of fact made by the homeowner. Although the homeowner concealed evidence of the water damage and of the leaking roof, mere nondisclosure of facts that are not material to the agreement does not amount to a misrepresentation. The homeowner's failure to disclose that the water damage existed or that the roof was leaking does not constitute a misrepresentation, because the facts were not material to the agreement. Whether or not a misrepresentation occurred is determined by whether the party making the representation knew, or should have known, that the representation was not true or that the other party to the contract would not have entered into the contract unless the representation had been true. Because the homeowner knew that the water damage existed and that the roof was leaking, and because the homeowner painted over the damage and lied about it, the homeowner should be found to have made a misrepresentation. However, this misrepresentation did not induce the buyer to enter into the contract, so the homeowner's misrepresentation does not provide a basis for avoiding the contract or recovering damages. The homeowner's misrepresentation is irrelevant to the formation of a contract. C is incorrect. The homeowner's nondisclosure of the water damage and the leaking roof is a misrepresentation of fact that induced the buyer's assent, and provides a basis for avoiding the contract or recovering damages.

On Monday morning of the first week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 8,000 pounds of flour to the bakery, and the bakery accepted it on the wholesaler\u2019s assurance that the remaining 2,000 pounds would be delivered later that evening, which it was. The bakery paid for both deliveries on Wednesday. On Monday of the second week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5,000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5,000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender. Was the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under the UCC, a buyer may reject a delivery if the delivery is a substantial impairment of that installment and cannot be cured. When the bakery rejected the tender of the fifth installment, it was not seeking to reject the entire contract because the tender was not a substantial impairment of the entire contract; rather, it was seeking to reject only that one installment. Because the tender was a substantial impairment of that installment and could not be cured, the bakery was legally justified in rejecting the tender. A is incorrect because the UCC does not give a seller the absolute right to cure a defective delivery. In any event, the wholesaler-bakery contract did not provide for perfect tender.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAn engineer entered into a written contract with an owner to serve in the essential position of on-site supervisor for construction of an office building. The day after signing the contract, the engineer was injured while bicycling and was rendered physically incapable of performing as the on-site supervisor. The engineer offered to serve as an off-site consultant for the same pay as originally agreed to by the parties. Is the owner likely to prevail in an action against the engineer for damages resulting from his failure to perform under the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the engineer offered a reasonable substitute by offering to serve as an off-site consultant.\nB. No, because the engineer\u2019s physical ability to perform as on-site supervisor was a basic assumption of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the engineer breached the contract by disappointing the owner\u2019s expectations.\nD. Yes, because the engineer\u2019s duty to perform was personal and absolute.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. When parties contract for specific performance, the court will grant specific performance if the party seeking specific performance is physically able to perform and refuses to do so, or if the party seeking specific performance is physically unable to perform and there is no reasonable substitute. Therefore, if the engineer is physically unable to perform as on-site supervisor and there is no reasonable substitute, the owner will likely prevail in its action against the engineer for damages resulting from his failure to perform under the contract. A is incorrect. It is true that the engineer offered to serve as an off-site consultant, but this would be a substantial impairment of the value of the contract for the owner, and therefore it would be a material modification of the contract. The parties did not agree to this modification, and under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one party's performance requires a period of time and the other party's performance is not subject to a similar condition, the language of the parties' agreement determines which party has the right to modify. In this case, because the engineer-owner contract is a personal services contract and the engineer is the only person who can perform the services, the engineer, not the owner, has the right to modify the contract by offering to serve as an off-site consultant. C is incorrect. While breach of contract may give the non-breaching party the right to recover damages equivalent to the difference between the contract price and the market value of the performance lost, it does not give the non-breaching party the right to recover damages for mere disappointed expectations. When parties contract for specific performance, the court will grant specific performance if the party seeking specific performance is physically able to perform and refuses to do so, or if the party seeking specific performance is physically unable to perform and there is no reasonable substitute. Therefore, when the engineer was physically unable to perform as on-site supervisor and there was no reasonable substitute, the owner would not be entitled to recover damages for mere disappointed expectations. D is incorrect. A contract for personal services may be either an employment-for-hire or a true contract for personal services, but either way it is a contract that involves a personal right and duty and is therefore a contract governed by the common law of contracts. Under the common law, a party's duty to perform under a personal services contract is personal and absolute, and a breach of that duty is a breach of the entire contract. Thus, it is incorrect to say that the engineer's duty to perform was not personal and absolute, or that his breach was only a partial breach.\n",

In fact, in early October, before the crop was harvested, it was destroyed by a hailstorm. Is the rancher liable for the loss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because no time for performance was established in the contract.\nB. No, because the neighbor failed to tell the rancher that the crop might be destroyed by a hailstorm.\nC.

The bookstore business, which was housed in a building that the aunt leased, was independently appraised at $200,000. The aunt decided to retire. She wrote to the niece, expressing her affection for the niece and offering to sell her the bookstore business for $125,000 if the landlord would agree to a transfer of the lease. The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt\u2019s offer. In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms. Before the attorney had finished drafting the document, the aunt changed her mind about selling the business and informed the niece of her decision. In an action for breach of contract brought by the niece against her aunt, is the niece likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the motivation for the transfer of the business was the aunt\u2019s affection for her niece, not the price.\nB.

Therefore, the borrower's damages are not limited to its expectation interest income, but rather extends to the $5,000 lost profit that was foreseeable at the time of contract formation. A is incorrect.

The acknowledgment repeated the terms of the buyer\u2019s offer and stated that shipment would occur within five days. Among 12 printed terms on the acknowledgment was a statement that any dispute about the cotton\u2019s quality would be submitted to arbitration. Neither the buyer nor the seller said anything further about arbitration. The seller shipped the cotton, and it was accepted by the buyer. A dispute arose between the buyer and the seller as to the quality of the cotton, and the seller asserted that the dispute had to be submitted to arbitration. The buyer instead sued the seller in court. In that suit, which of the following arguments best supports the seller\u2019s position that the buyer must submit the dispute to arbitration?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Arbitration is a more efficient method of resolving disputes than resolving them in court.\nB. The provision for arbitration did not contradict any term in the buyer\u2019s offer.\nC. The provision for arbitration did not materially alter the parties\u2019 contract.\nD. The seller\u2019s acknowledgment containing a provision for arbitration constituted a counteroffer that was accepted by the\nbuyer when it accepted delivery of the cotton.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. When the buyer sent its offer, it contained no provision for arbitration. Arbitration is an additional term that the seller added to its acknowledgment. Under UCC \u00a7 2-207(2), a written contract that is silent as to arbitration may still be subject to arbitration if the arbitration term in the acknowledgment was a material alteration of the parties' contract. Here, the buyer's offer was silent as to arbitration; therefore, UCC \u00a7 2-207(2) applies. Arbitration is an additional term that is a material alteration of the parties' contract. Therefore, C is correct. A is incorrect. While arbitration may be a more efficient method of resolving disputes than resolving them in court, that is not the correct basis for supporting the seller's position that the buyer must submit the dispute to arbitration. B is incorrect. The buyer's offer was silent as to arbitration. Therefore, UCC \u00a7 2-207(2) applies. Arbitration is an additional term that was a material alteration of the parties' contract. Therefore, B is incorrect. C is a better argument than B.\n",

            "explanation": "Because the buyer\u2019s offer was silent as to arbitration, the arbitration provision in the seller\u2019s acknowledgment should be characterized as an additional term. Under UCC \u00a7 2-207(2), an additional term is considered a proposal for addition to the contract. Section 2-207(2) also provides that an additional term becomes a term of the parties\u2019 contract unless certain specified circumstances are present. One such circumstance is where an additional term materially alters the parties\u2019 contract. Because none of the other circumstances appear applicable here, the arbitration provision will be considered a term of the contract if the seller can successfully argue that the provision did not materially alter the parties\u2019 contract.",

The developer told the buyer that the lot abutted a national park and that the water for the house came from a natural artesian spring. The developer knew that both of these representations were important to the buyer and that both were false. The buyer moved into the house and eight months later learned that a private golf course was being constructed on the adjacent land and that the water for his house was piped in from the city reservoir. The buyer immediately sued the developer to avoid the contract. The construction of the golf course will probably increase the market value of the buyer\u2019s property, and the water from the city reservoir exceeds all established standards for drinking water. Is the buyer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because eight months exceeds a reasonable time for contract avoidance.\nB.

The issue is whether the nonoccurrence of the condition (in this case, the buyer's securing bank financing at an interest rate of 7% or below) can be excused. A court will imply a term imposing on the buyer a duty to use reasonable efforts to secure bank financing, which is a duty that can be excused only in limited circumstances, such as where it is impossible for the buyer to secure bank financing. Therefore, the performance is due, and the seller is likely to prevail. A is incorrect.

Three months later, the retail outlet sold the service portion of its business to an experienced and well-financed computer service company. The only provision in the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company relating to the outlet\u2019s contract with the bank stated that the outlet \u201chereby assigns all of its computer service contracts to [the computer service company].\u201d The computer service company performed the monthly maintenance required under the service contract. Its performance was defective, however, and caused damage to the bank\u2019s operations. Whom can the bank sue for damages arising from the computer service company\u2019s defective performance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The retail outlet only, because the computer service company made no promises to the bank.\nB. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because the bank has not released the outlet and the bank is\nan intended beneficiary of the outlet\u2019s agreement with the computer service company.\nC. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because since each has the right to enforce the bank\u2019s\nperformance of its contract with the retail outlet, mutuality of remedy renders either potentially liable for the defective\nperformance.\nD.

An assignment of a contract is effective to transfer rights only if the assignee becomes obligated to the obligor (the bank) to perform the contract. In other words, an effective assignment requires an effective delegation of rights and duties by the assignor (the retail outlet). The facts indicate that the retail outlet assigned its service contract with the bank to the computer service company. The computer service company is a qualified and financially responsible supplier of computer services, so it is a potential substitute for the retail outlet. Therefore, the assignment of the service contract to the computer service company effected a delegation of the retail outlet\u2019s duties under the contract to the computer service company.

When the wheat arrived at the destination, the buyer discovered that the farmer had delivered only 96,000 bushels. The buyer sued the farmer for breach of contract. At the trial of the case, the court found that the written contract was intended as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement. The farmer offered to prove that in the wheat business, a promise to deliver a specified quantity is considered to be satisfied if the delivered quantity is within 5% of the specified quantity. The buyer objected to the offered evidence. Is the court likely to admit the evidence offered by the farmer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the offered evidence is inconsistent with the express language of the agreement.\nB. No, because the written contract was totally integrated.\nC.

Although the written contract was silent as to the acceptable quantity, the trade usage allowing for a variation of 5% is a proper and admissible means of determining whether the farmer substantially complied with the contract. A is incorrect.

But it would be really nice if you would sell me the family home for $100,000.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the mother. \u201cIt is worth a lot more than that\u2014at least $250,000.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the daughter. \u201cBut I have always been good and visited you, and my brother has never visited you, so that ought to be worth something.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. A contract to transfer property is voidable if the transfer is undertaken under undue influence. Undue influence is a transfer of control of a decision to contract, which occurs where a transferor is subject to such coercion that the transferor's consent to the transaction is not voluntary. The facts state that the daughter threatened to withhold her care of her mother unless she sold her the family home. Although the value of the home is debatable, and the fact that the mother may not have wanted to part with it suggests that she may not have been subject to undue influence, she was sufficiently controlled by her daughter's threat to warrant a finding of undue influence. A is incorrect. Duress is a form of coercion that involves a threat of bodily harm to the transferor. The mother was not threatened with bodily harm, and the contract does not fall within the duress exception to the undue influence rule. B is incorrect. Inadequate consideration is a defense to a contract to convey land. But inadequate consideration does not apply when the transfer is made under undue influence. C is incorrect. Mistake is a defense to a contract to convey land if the transferor did not understand the nature and extent of the rights he or she was transferring.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. Under the pre-offer rule, an offer for a unilateral contract that seeks a return promise (an offer for a bilateral contract) is effective for three months after the offer is made, unless the offer specifies otherwise. Although the offer stated that the lender would discharge the debt, it sought only a return promise from the borrower. Therefore, the offer was effective for three months after it was made, and the lender was free to revoke his offer at any time before that period expired. B is incorrect. An executory accord is an agreement in which one party (the promisor) undertakes an obligation to do something in the future, while the other party (the promisee) promises not to insist on performance. Although an executory accord may be enforceable in certain circumstances, such as where the subject matter of the promise is a debt, the facts do not indicate that the lender-borrower telephone conversation was an executory accord. C is incorrect. Gift promises are enforceable in certain circumstances, such as where the promise is made to benefit a third person. However, the facts do not indicate that the lender was making the promise to benefit the borrower. D is incorrect. Although the rule stating that bilateral contracts do not need to be in writing to be enforceable does not apply to contracts for the sale of land, it does apply to contracts for the sale of goods. The sale of goods contract that was created by the lender-borrower telephone conversation is enforceable, even though it is not in writing, because the contract is bilateral and not a land sale contract.\n",

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

The letters are also hearsay if they are being offered to show that the microwave oven was defective or dangerous.

A is incorrect because the plaintiff does not need to be qualified as an expert to testify about the fact that she had never had any problems with her back before the accident. The rule excluding lay opinion evidence of injury does not apply when the injury is a physical condition and the opinion is based on the perception of the witness. B is incorrect because the fact that the injury could have been caused by something that happened after the accident is probative on the issue of whether the accident was the cause of the injury.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. It is a statement by a party-opponent\u2019s agent. The defendant\u2019s agent made the statement to the cyclist, who is an adverse party in the lawsuit. The agent was speaking on behalf of the defendant when he made the statement. Although the agent may no longer be working for the defendant, the statement is still admissible as a statement by a party-opponent\u2019s agent. A is incorrect. The statement is not a prior inconsistent statement. Although the statement may be inconsistent with the employee\u2019s testimony at trial, a prior inconsistent statement is defined as a material contradiction of a statement that is given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a hearing or trial. Because the statement was not made under oath, it does not qualify as a prior inconsistent statement. B is incorrect. Although the statement is against interest, it is not a statement against pecuniary interest. A statement is considered to be against interest if it is a statement that tends to subject the declarant to possible criminal liability or renders invalid a claim he may have against the opposing party. Although the statement is against interest in that it may subject the employee to civil liability, it does not render invalid any claim he may have against the cyclist, and it is insufficient for the statement to be considered a statement against pecuniary interest. D is incorrect. Although the statement may have been made while the employee was aware of his existing mental condition, it is insufficient for the statement to qualify as a statement of then-existing mental condition. A statement of then-existing mental condition is a statement that describes or explains an attitude, which exists at the time it is made and which is independent of the declarant\u2019s intent to prove the attitude.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. A charge of conspiracy requires that there exist an agreement that a crime be committed and that at least two of the co-conspirators intend that the crime be committed. The evidence in this case shows that the woman and her sister agreed to import cocaine, and that both the woman and her sister knew the cocaine was illegal. Therefore, A is correct. B is incorrect. Possession of cocaine is insufficient evidence to sustain a charge of conspiracy to commit cocaine possession. Although it is possible that both the woman and her sister possessed the cocaine because they agreed to do so, it is more likely that each of them simply possessed the cocaine independently. Because there is insufficient evidence to show that the woman and her sister agreed to commit the crime of cocaine possession, B is incorrect. C is incorrect. It is true that mere possession of drugs is insufficient for a conviction of conspiracy to commit drug possession; however, in this case, the evidence shows that both the woman and her sister possessed the cocaine, which is sufficient evidence to sustain a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine. The woman\u2019s statement that there were too many officers at the airport is insufficient evidence to show that the woman withdrew from the conspiracy. Therefore, C is incorrect. D is incorrect. Withdrawal from a conspiracy cannot be accomplished simply by cooperating with the government; there must be a disassociation from the ongoing agreement to commit a crime. In this case, the woman did not provide a statement that she no longer wished to participate in the conspiracy; instead, she broke down and cried, \u201cI told my sister there were too many officers at this airport.\u201d Therefore, D is incorrect.\n",

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA store owner whose jewelry store had recently been robbed was shown by a police detective a photograph of the defendant, who previously had committed other similar crimes. The store owner examined the photograph and then asked the detective whether the police believed that the man pictured was the robber. After the detective said, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty sure,\u201d the store owner stated that the man in the photograph was the one who had robbed her. The defendant was indicted for the robbery. His counsel moved to suppress any trial testimony by the store owner identifying the defendant as the robber. Should the court grant the motion and suppress the store owner\u2019s trial testimony identifying the defendant as the robber?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because suppression of in-court testimony is not a proper remedy, even though the out-of-court identification was\nimproper.\nB. No, because the out-of-court identification was not improper.\nC. Yes, because the improper out-of-court identification has necessarily tainted any in-court identification.\nD. Yes, unless the prosecution demonstrates that the in-court identification is reliable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. An out-of-court identification procedure is improper if it is unnecessarily suggestive, which this procedure (involving just one photograph and the detective\u2019s statement that the man in the photograph was the robber) plainly is. Thus, A is incorrect. However, suppression of an improper out-of-court identification is not the only remedy available. B is incorrect. While it is true that suppression of an improper out-of-court identification is not a proper remedy, the remedy need not be so limited. Instead, the remedy should be tailored to deter misconduct, to serve the interests of justice, and to protect the dignity of the Accused. Here, suppression of the out-of-court identification would deter the police from conducting improper lineups or photograph shows, serve the interests of justice by allowing the defendant to be tried for the crime of which he was actually guilty, and protect the dignity of the Accused by not allowing him to be convicted based on an improper identification procedure. Therefore, the remedy of suppressing the out-of-court identification is a proper remedy in this case, and B is incorrect. C is incorrect. It is true that an improper out-of-court identification procedure may taint an in-court identification procedure, but the remedy for this taint does not have to be to suppress the in-court testimony. Instead, the remedy may include any step that would prevent the misconduct from infecting the trial. In this case, the remedy of suppressing the out-of-court identification is a proper remedy, but it is not the only remedy available.\n",

An agent decided to enter the man\u2019s house while he was not at home and see what he could find. The agent discovered an envelope containing $5,000 in cash and an executive\u2019s business card. Returning the envelope to its place, the agent located and interviewed the executive, who admitted that he had paid the man $5,000 to settle a gambling debt; the executive also disclosed that the man regularly took illegal bets from the executive and several of his acquaintances. The agent then interviewed the acquaintances, who confirmed what the executive had told him. The agent then arranged to be introduced to the man at a local bar. After a few drinks, the man, unaware of the agent\u2019s identity, boasted that he was one of the biggest bookmakers in the state. The agent testified to all of his investigation\u2019s discoveries before a grand jury, which returned an indictment against the man for illegal gambling activities, based solely on the agent\u2019s testimony. The man\u2019s attorney then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it rested on violations of the man\u2019s constitutional rights.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The mens rea or scienter standard of proof for a conviction under the statute is recklessness, defined as disregard of a substantial and unjustified risk that the material element exists or will result from the defendant\u2019s conduct. The evidence shows that the defendant did not have a particular intent, but she did have knowledge of the risk that the victim was age 65 or older, and she disregarded that risk. The jury could find that there was no justification for the defendant\u2019s conduct and that she was willing to take the risk that the victim was age 65 or older, so the defendant could properly be convicted. A is incorrect. The evidence shows that the defendant had knowledge of the risk that the victim was age 65 or older, and she disregarded that risk. There is no affirmative defense to the offense listed in the statute. Thus, the defendant cannot avoid liability simply because she did not know the victim\u2019s age. B is incorrect. The evidence shows that the defendant had knowledge of the risk that the victim was age 65 or older, and she disregarded that risk. There is no affirmative defense to the offense listed in the statute. Thus, the defendant cannot avoid liability simply because she did not know the victim\u2019s age. C is incorrect. The statute itself provides that it is designed to protect the elderly. However, the fact that the statute is designed to protect a particular class of persons does not negate the need to prove that the class has been in fact victims of the crime. Moreover, the fact that the statute is designed to protect a particular class of persons does not make the classification constitutional.\n",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nWhile on their way home from a ball game, a driver and his passenger stopped at an all-night gas station. The passenger offered to pay for the gas. While the passenger pumped gas, he was surprised to see the driver enter the station, take money from the unattended cash drawer, and get back in the car. The passenger paid the attendant for the gas, and the driver drove off. The driver offered to reimburse the passenger for the gas, but the passenger declined. After discovering the missing cash, the gas station attendant called the police, and the driver was later stopped. The driver escaped with the stolen money, however, and was never prosecuted. If the passenger is prosecuted for theft as an accomplice, should he be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because he had no intent to promote the commission of the offense.\nB. No, because the driver, the principal, was never prosecuted.\nC. Yes, because he facilitated commission of the offense by failing to make any effort to stop it.\nD. Yes, because he paid the attendant while he knew the driver was holding the stolen money.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. To be convicted as an accomplice, the alleged accomplice must have the intent that the crime be committed and aid or abet in the commission of the offense. The passenger had the intent to promote commission of the offense of theft when he facilitated the driver's crime by failing to make any effort to stop it. The passenger is guilty as an accomplice and should be convicted. A is incorrect. The passenger's lack of intent to promote the commission of the offense does not negate his aider-abettor status. It is irrelevant to the analysis whether the passenger knew the driver was committing theft or not. B is incorrect. The driver's nonprosecution does not automatically negate the passenger's guilt as an accomplice. C is the best answer.\n",

Upon arriving at the house, the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious. An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine. After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana. The young woman has filed a motion to suppress the use of both as evidence on the ground that the entry into the house and the searches were made without a warrant. How should the court decide the young woman\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Grant it as to the cocaine, but deny it as to the marijuana.\nB. Deny it as to the cocaine, but grant it as to the marijuana.\nC. Grant it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nD. Deny it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The police entry of the house and the searches were done incident to a valid emergency response, and thus, did not violate the Fourth Amendment. See Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985). The young woman cannot separate out the cocaine and the marijuana evidence and have the cocaine suppressed, but keep the marijuana admissible. A is incorrect. The emergency exception to the warrant requirement does not apply when the police are attempting to find evidence of a crime other than the one for which they were responding. See Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1 (1995). Thus, the police should not have been able to seize the cocaine without a warrant, and the young woman\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine evidence should be granted. However, the emergency exception does apply when the police are attempting to find evidence of a crime that the police reasonably believed created an imminent danger to themselves or the public. See Evans, 514 U.S. at 8. When the police reasonably believed that the man had been shot and was unconscious and that there might be a killer still at large, the police were acting reasonably when they entered the house and when they conducted a search of the house. See id. at 10. Therefore, the young woman cannot separate out the cocaine evidence and have it suppressed, but keep the marijuana admissible. B is incorrect.
