The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn a suit based on a will, inheritance of $1 million depended upon whether the wife had survived her husband when both died in the crash of a small airplane. An applicable statute provided that, for purposes of distributing an estate after a common disaster, there was a rebuttable presumption that neither spouse had survived the other. A witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane she heard what she thought was a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d although by the time the two occupants were removed from the wreckage they were both dead. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.\nB. No, because the witness\u2019s testimony is too speculative to support a finding.\nC. Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.\nD. Yes, because it is relevant and not otherwise prohibited.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The testimony is not barred by the hearsay rule or any other rule and is relevant on the issue of whether the wife survived her husband. The testimony is not speculative. Although the witness\u2019s description of the sounds she heard could be characterized as lay opinion, it is not being offered for an opinion about the facts but rather to establish the wife\u2019s state of mind. It is relevant because if the wife was saying that she was dying, it is more likely that she survived her husband. A is incorrect. The majority common law rule, which is followed by the majority of states, is that a statement by a decedent in an action to determine rights under a will is an exception to the hearsay rule. C is incorrect. The witness\u2019s testimony is not hearsay. Although it is an out-of-court statement, the statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted but rather to show whether the wife was alive at the time of the accident.

Is the judge\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s statement admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, as the statement of a party-opponent.\nB. Yes, because the defendant\u2019s statement, although otherwise privileged, was made without reasonable efforts to\npreserve confidentiality.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct.

Here, the defendant\u2019s statement to his attorney is being offered against the defendant, not in his defense, and is admissible as a statement of a party-opponent. B is incorrect because the statement is privileged, not confidential. The defendant\u2019s statement is protected by the attorney-client privilege, not the confidential communications privilege. Although a statement may be considered confidential if it was made without reasonable efforts to preserve confidentiality, see Rule 501(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the defendant\u2019s statement was made within earshot of the hallway, and thus was not a confidential communication. D is incorrect because a judge can testify in a proceeding in which he or she is not presiding. The judge\u2019s testimony here is not a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. C is incorrect because the statement is protected by the attorney-client privilege, not the client\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant\u2019s statement is protected by the attorney-client privilege, not his privilege against self-incrimination.

Yes, because the plaintiff is present and can be cross-examined about it.\nB. Yes, because it was made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The police report itself would be inadmissible under the hearsay rule, but the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule allows the proponent to introduce a statement that would otherwise be barred by the hearsay rule if the declarant testifies and is available for cross- examination about the statement.

The witness established that the tape recording was a record of recollection and that she made it when the matter was fresh in her memory, and she testified that the tape recording was an accurate record of her memory.

However, the probative value of evidence may be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, or undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Because the evidence in this case is weak, the judge should grant the motion to strike the testimony of the medical examiner. If the jury believes the medical examiner\u2019s testimony, it could convict the defendant of aggravated battery, but it also could just as easily convict the defendant of larceny or assault. The evidence against the defendant could be just as easily presented by another knife.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nWhen a man entered a bank and presented a check for payment, the bank teller recognized the signature on the check as a forgery because the check was drawn on the account of a customer whose handwriting she knew. The bank teller called the police. Before the police arrived, the man picked up the check from the counter and left. The man was charged with attempting to cash a forged check. At trial, the prosecutor called the bank teller to testify that the signature on the check was forged. Is the bank teller\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because a bank teller is by occupation an expert on handwriting.\nB. Yes, because it is rationally based on the bank teller\u2019s perception and is helpful to the jury.\nC. No, because the bank teller was at fault in allowing loss of the original by failing to secure the check.\nD. No, because it is not possible for either the jury or an expert to compare the signature on the missing check with a\nsignature established as genuine.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows lay opinion testimony when it is rationally based on the perception of the witness and is helpful to the jury. Here the teller\u2019s testimony that the signature was a forgery is not a lay opinion; it is a declaration that a signature is not what it appears to be. Such a declaration is admissible as expert testimony under Rule 702 when it is given by a witness who, by occupation, has expertise in handwriting. But because the bank teller\u2019s testimony is based on more than mere familiarity with the signature on the check, it is not lay opinion testimony. The teller\u2019s familiarity with the signature on the check allows her to recognize the signature as a forgery, a conclusion that requires knowledge of how to detect a forgery. Her testimony is expert testimony because it is given by a witness with expertise in handwriting. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. Furthermore, the testimony is not admissible under Rule 702 because it is not the best explanation or opinion that the witness has to offer on the subject. The testimony is not the product of reliable principles and methods, but is based on the bank teller\u2019s familiarity with a signature on a check that is missing.

A present sense impression is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and is being introduced to prove the fact that it was said. A prior recorded testimony is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and is being introduced to prove the fact that it was said. Both a present sense impression and a prior recorded testimony are hearsay and are inadmissible under the hearsay rule. However, if the witness once knew the license plate number but now has insufficient recollection to testify fully and accurately, the witness may testify to the best of his memory and the testimony is admissible as a past recollection recorded. If the witness has insufficient recollection to testify fully and accurately, the witness may look at the tape recording and listen to his own prior testimony. The witness can then testify about the license plate number. The testimony is admissible as a present sense impression because the witness is testifying about the license plate number while he was still near the accident scene and is testifying about what he actually saw and heard, not what someone else told him. The testimony is also admissible as a past recollection recorded because it is a statement the witness once made that was recorded when the witness was near the accident scene and testifying about what he actually saw and heard, not what someone else told him. Thus, both answers are correct. A is incorrect because the testimony is admissible as both a present sense impression and a past recollection recorded.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA state statute provides as follows: \u201cIn all criminal cases, whenever the Constitution permits, the burden of proof as to a defense claimed by the defendant shall rest on the defendant, and the magnitude of the burden shall be as great as the Constitution permits.\u201d The same state defines the crime of forcible rape as follows: \u201cForcible rape consists of sexual penetration inflicted on an unconsenting person by means of force or violence. Consent of the victim is a complete defense to a charge of rape.\u201d At a defendant\u2019s trial for forcible rape, he testified that the alleged victim had consented to having sexual intercourse with him. How should the trial judge instruct the jury regarding the issue of consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by a preponderance of the evidence, rests on the defendant.\nB. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by clear and convincing evidence, rests on the defendant.\nC. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the defendant.\nD.

Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun. The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to suppress its use as evidence. Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.\nB. Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.\nC. No, because, having found the package, the agents had probable cause to believe more narcotics could be located in\nthe house and the gun was found in a proper search for narcotics.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The warrant authorized the agents to search for and seize the package containing heroin, and nothing in the warrant authorized the agents to conduct an unlimited search of the house.

Moreover, even if it had violated the Fourth Amendment, the evidence seized in the house would not be excluded from trial. See Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533 (1988). C is incorrect. The agents' search was justified only by their belief that narcotics were contained in the package; they had no reason to believe that a search of the house would locate more narcotics or evidence of narcotics-related crimes.

They drove several miles, crossed into a neighboring state, and drove several more miles. When they reached a remote location, the stranger ordered the driver to pull over. The stranger then robbed the driver of his wallet and cash, and ordered him out of the car. The stranger drove off in the driver\u2019s car.

Yes, because the driver in effect paid ransom for his release.\nC. No, because any kidnapping took place in the driver\u2019s home state.\nD. No, because the restraint was incidental to the robbery.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. Model Penal Code section 212.1 defines kidnapping as the \u201ctaking of a person by force or threat of force with the intent to cause that person to be carried away from his or her home or confined.\u201d The driver\u2019s transportation in the neighboring state was the carrying away of the driver from his home state to the neighboring state, and was done under threat of force by the stranger. The stranger\u2019s threat of force caused the driver to continue to drive the car even after he would have normally stopped his vehicle. Therefore, the stranger properly can be convicted of kidnapping in the neighboring state. B is incorrect because ransom payments are voluntary and do not constitute kidnapping even if made under threat of force. Model Penal Code section 212.1 defines kidnapping as the taking of a person by force or threat of force with the intent to cause that person to be carried away from his or her home or confined. If the driver had paid ransom money to the stranger because of a threat to harm his family, that would have been a voluntary payment and thus not the taking of ransom under threat of force. C is incorrect because the fact that the kidnapping took place in the driver\u2019s home state does not preclude prosecution in the neighboring state.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The man\u2019s sleeping and unconscious state is important because it determines the appropriate crime for which the patron properly could be convicted. If the patron had taken the man\u2019s wallet while he was awake and alert, it would have been larceny. Larceny is the taking of another person\u2019s property with the intent to permanently deprive that person of it. If the patron took the wallet after the man had fallen unconscious and was unable to resist, it would be robbery. Robbery is the taking of another person\u2019s property by use of force or the threat of force. The attempt crimes listed in the answer choices are not listed in descending order of seriousness. The crime attempted is the crime that the actor had the intent to commit and took substantial steps toward the commission of but did not commit. In this case, the patron\u2019s attempt to take the man\u2019s wallet would be robbery because the patron had the intent to take the property by force or threat of force and took substantial steps toward the commission of that crime. A is incorrect because the man\u2019s unconscious state negated any intent to take his property.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA drug dealer agreed with another individual to purchase heroin from the individual in order to sell it on a city street corner. Unknown to the drug dealer, the other individual was an undercover police officer whose only purpose was to arrest distributors of drugs. The drug dealer made a down payment for the heroin and agreed to pay the remainder after he sold it on the street. As soon as the undercover officer handed over the heroin, other officers moved in and arrested the dealer. The jurisdiction follows the common law approach to conspiracy. Could the dealer properly be convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because there was no overt act.\nB. No, because there was no plurality of agreement.\nC. Yes, because neither an overt act nor plurality of agreement is required at common law.\nD. Yes, because the dealer believed all the elements of conspiracy were present and cannot take advantage of a mistake\nof fact or law.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The dealer cannot be convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs. The common law requires plurality of agreement and does not criminalize \"unilateral\" conspiracy where only one person actually agreed to commit the crime and the other only feigned agreement. Here, the drug dealer agreed to buy and distribute the heroin, but the individual--an undercover police officer--merely feigned an intent to be a part of the crime as part of his undercover operation. Thus, B is correct. A is incorrect. The common law does not require an overt act for conspiracy. C is incorrect. Plurality of agreement is required unless one person has been induced by fraud or mistake to believe that the other intends to join the conspiracy. In this case, the drug dealer believed he was agreeing to buy and distribute the heroin, so his mistake of law is not a valid defense.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

The diplomat became friendly with a woman in a bar who he believed was small enough to crawl through the air vent. Without telling her that he was a diplomat, he explained how she could get into the jewelry store. She agreed to help him burglarize the store. Someone overheard their conversation and reported it to the police. Shortly thereafter, the police arrested the diplomat and the woman. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. Before trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity. The court granted his motion. The woman then moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her. The jurisdiction has adopted the Model Penal Code version of conspiracy. Should the woman\u2019s motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the diplomat\u2019s defense does not negate any element of the crime.\nB. No, because the woman was not aware of the diplomat\u2019s status.\nC. Yes, because a conspiracy requires two guilty participants.\nD. Yes, because but for the diplomat\u2019s conduct, no conspiracy would have occurred.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Model Penal Code section 5.03(1), by defining conspiracy as requiring agreement by the defendant but not by two or more persons, adopts the unilateral interpretation of conspiracy. Therefore, a conspiracy can be proved by showing agreement by one person even if the other(s) did not agree. In this case, the woman and the diplomat agreed to commit the offense of burglary, and the woman will be guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary. A is incorrect. The diplomat\u2019s defense does negate an element of the crime. The defense of entrapment negates the intent required for a conspiracy charge by showing that the defendant was forced to commit the crime. Although the woman did not intend to commit the crime, her partnership in the crime is shown by the fact that she agreed to help the diplomat burglarize the jewelry store. C is incorrect. A charge of conspiracy requires only two participants to commit the crime, not two guilty participants. A court will dismiss a conspiracy charge against an innocent co-conspirator, even if the defendant is guilty. B is incorrect. It is irrelevant whether the woman knew the diplomat\u2019s status.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA man decided to steal a car he saw parked on a hill. When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car\u2019s brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store\u2019s property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man\u2019s conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because he was committing a felony.\nC. No, because the instruction wrongly described the necessary mental state.\nD. No, because it would violate double jeopardy to convict the man of two crimes for a single act.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The instruction was wrong. Intent to steal the car would not prove the man knowingly damaged the store. To have acted knowingly, the man must have been practically certain that his conduct would damage the store. Thus, C is correct, and A is incorrect. Nevertheless, the conviction should be affirmed. It is a well-established exception to the double jeopardy rule that a defendant may be convicted of both the intended crime and any crime committed in the commission of that crime. Here, the instruction was wrong. But the man was charged with and convicted of the malicious damage of property after he was convicted of larceny of the car, which is the intended crime. Thus, the double jeopardy rule does not bar the conviction for malicious damage of property. B is incorrect. The fact that the crime is a felony is not a sufficient mental state to prove that the man acted knowingly. C is incorrect.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

The grand jury issued a subpoena duces tecum requiring the suspect to produce any diary. The subpoena made clear that the grand jury was seeking only the diary and not any testimony from the suspect. The suspect refused to produce the diary, citing the privilege against self-incrimination. Under what circumstances, if any, could the grand jury compel production of the diary over the suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It may compel production without granting immunity because the suspect was not compelled to write a diary.\nB.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination protects only testimonial or communicative evidence, and not real or physical evidence. Therefore, it protects acts of production that have testimonial significance by authenticating documents. Thus, A is incorrect. However, a criminal defendant may be compelled to produce documents that have testimonial significance if immunity is granted to the defendant. There are two kinds of immunity that may be granted. The broader form of immunity is \"transactional immunity.\" Transactional immunity completely protects the witness from future prosecution for crimes related to his or her testimony. \"Use and derivative use\" immunity is narrower--it protects the witness only from prosecution for crimes arising directly from his or her testimony.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied in actions that demonstrate gross recklessness toward human life. By firing an indiscriminate barrage of shotgun rounds in a factory filled with workers, the man acted with malice aforethought, and should be convicted of murder. Because the man knew that there were other people in the factory, and took no precautions to ensure that he would not kill someone, his actions show an extreme reckless disregard for human life. Thus, A is the most serious offense that the man could be convicted of. B, C, and D are incorrect because these crimes are less serious than murder.

The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization\u2019s request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization\u2019s placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator\u2019s decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the administrator\u2019s denial of space to the organization was a reasonable time, manner, and place\nrestriction of speech.\nB.

In response, the city council enacted an ordinance requiring any \u201csign or visual display\u201d visible on the streets of the historic district to be black and white and to be no more than four feet long or wide. A political party wanted to hang a six-foot-long red, white, and blue political banner in front of a building in the historic district. The party filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the sign ordinance as applied to the display of its banner.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The political party\u2019s best argument is that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to an important government interest, nor does it leave open alternative channels of communication. Because the ordinance is a content-neutral restriction of expression, it must satisfy intermediate scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires the city to prove that the ordinance is necessary to an important government interest and that the ordinance is narrowly tailored to that interest. It is not sufficient for the city to prove that the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Additionally, the ordinance must allow for alternative channels of communication. Here, the ordinance would prohibit all signs from the historic district. This would be a content-neutral restriction of expression because the ordinance prohibits all signs, not just political signs. Thus, B is correct. A is incorrect because the ordinance will not satisfy strict scrutiny, a higher standard than intermediate scrutiny. It is insufficient for the city to prove that the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Additionally, a court will not apply strict scrutiny to a content-neutral restriction of expression. C is incorrect because a prior restraint on political expression is the best argument for the political party, and that argument was already listed as correct. D is incorrect because the ordinance does not favor some categories of speech over others.

A group of physicians announced its plan to immediately open in the state a diagnostic center that would not be affiliated with a hospital.

The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community\u2019s residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens\u2019 group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill. The agency officials moved to dismiss. Which of the following is the most appropriate basis for the court to dismiss this suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Pursuant to this statute, the President has determined that the construction of a surveillance facility on a very small, unused portion of an owner\u2019s large tract of land is necessary to safeguard the security of the United States. The construction and operation of the facility will not affect any of the uses that the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land. The owner has filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the construction of a surveillance facility on the parcel of land at issue without compensation.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Any permanent physical occupation by the government of private property is a taking for which the property owner must be justly compensated. It is irrelevant that in this case the portion of the owner\u2019s tract of land to be occupied by the surveillance facility is unused and very small. Thus, A is correct. B is incorrect. It is irrelevant for purposes of the Fifth Amendment that the construction of the surveillance facility may single out the owner for adverse treatment when compared to other landowners in similar situations. Because the construction of the facility will not affect any use the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land, the fact that it might affect future uses is irrelevant. Such a future effect, no matter how speculative, is insufficient to trigger the Fifth Amendment. D is incorrect.

The Supreme Court has held that a government interest in national security must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest in order to satisfy the Fifth Amendment.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landowner who owned a large tract of land in the mountains sought to protect a herd of wild deer that frequented the area. Although the landowner had posted signs that said, \u201cNo Hunting\u2014No Trespassing,\u201d hunters frequently intruded to kill the deer. Recently, the landowner built an eight-foot chain-link fence, topped by three strands of barbed wire, across a gully on her land that provided the only access to the area frequented by the deer. A wildlife photographer asked the landowner for permission to enter the property to photograph the deer. Because the landowner feared that any publicity would encourage further intrusions, she denied the photographer\u2019s request. Frustrated, the photographer attempted to climb the fence. He became entangled in the barbed wire and suffered extensive lacerations. The wounds became infected and ultimately caused his death. The photographer\u2019s personal representative brought an action against the landowner. Will the plaintiff prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the landowner may not use deadly force to protect her land from intrusion.\nB. Yes, because the landowner had no property interest in the deer that entitled her to use force to protect them.\nC. No, because the photographer entered the landowner\u2019s land after the landowner had refused him permission to do so.\nD. No, because the potential for harm created by the presence of the barbed wire was apparent.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The force, however, must be reasonable in relation to the injury suffered by the photographer. Barbed wire is generally considered to be reasonable in protecting a landowner\u2019s land from intrusion where the area is uninhabited and the intruder is likely to be deterred by the presence of the wire. However, where the intruder is lured by the presence of wildlife and the potential for harm is apparent, the use of barbed wire may not be reasonable. As an occupier of the land, the landowner had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the conduct of her operations to protect the photographer from harm.

The construction company negligently selected an unusually slippery material for the floor covering. A customer at the mall slipped on the floor of the entryway, sustaining injuries. The customer sued the mall owner for the construction company\u2019s negligent design of the mall\u2019s entryway. Will the injured customer recover damages?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, if the construction company was an independent contractor.\nB. No, if no customers had previously slipped on the floor.\nC. Yes, if the customer intended to make a purchase at the mall.\nD. Yes, if the mall\u2019s duty to maintain safe conditions was nondelegable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Ordinarily, someone who hires an independent contractor to design or build something is not liable for harms caused by the contractor\u2019s negligent designs or constructions. However, a landowner who holds his land open to the public has a nondelegable duty to keep the premises safe for business invitees. Such a landowner is liable for any negligent conduct that causes a guest to be injured, even the conduct of an independent contractor. The mall owner\u2019s employment of the construction company to design and build the entryway resulted in a delegation of the mall owner\u2019s duty of care to the construction company; ordinarily, such a delegation would mean that the mall owner would not be liable if the construction company negligently designed or built the entryway. However, a landowner who holds his land open to the public has a nondelegable duty to keep the premises safe for business invitees. Such a landowner is liable for any negligent conduct that causes a guest to be injured, even the conduct of an independent contractor. Because the mall owner is liable, the injured customer can recover damages for the construction company\u2019s negligent design of the mall\u2019s entryway. A is incorrect. Even if the construction company was an employee of the mall owner rather than an independent contractor, the mall owner probably would not be liable, because landowners generally are not liable for the acts of their employees unless the employees are in a position to cause a guest to be injured. B is incorrect. Whether other customers had slipped on the floor before the customer\u2019s fall is irrelevant, because mere fact-finding negligence is not a proximate cause of the customer\u2019s injuries. C is incorrect. Whether the customer intended to shop or merely to get a look at the mall\u2019s interior is irrelevant.

Yes, because the property owner is liable for hidden dangers on his property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The property owner has no duty to protect the hiker, who was a mere trespasser, from injury by foreign objects. A property owner generally will not be found liable for injuries caused by foreign objects even if the owner had actual knowledge of the specific object that caused the injury. However, the property owner may be liable for injuries caused by foreign objects if the owner had constructive knowledge of the specific object that caused the injury. Constructive knowledge arises when a property owner has actual knowledge of the presence of the foreign object or when the object is so near to the owner's property that it is foreseeable that it may injure someone. Although the facts in this case state that the tree was infested with termites, it does not state that the owner knew this fact. Therefore, B is correct. A is incorrect. The facts do not indicate that the owner could not foresee that anyone would be injured. It is possible to infer that anyone who visited the property would be at risk for injury by falling trees or branches. C is incorrect.

That test requires that the plaintiff show: (i) that the defendant published a false or misleading statement about the plaintiff, (ii) that the defendant had actual malice in publishing the statement or entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the statement, and (iii) that the publication of the false statement caused the plaintiff to be shunned by a substantial portion of the public. Here, the famous driver probably would satisfy the first and third parts of the Gertz test, but not the second. It is not clear that the advertisement published by the cigarette maker was false or misleading. Furthermore, the famous driver probably would not show that the cigarette maker entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the statement, since the advertisement was not a photographic reproduction of the famous driver or his car. Therefore, B is correct. A is incorrect. The driver may have a claim for misappropriation of his identity, but he will have to satisfy the Gertz test for a celebrity plaintiff. Moreover, the fact that the advertisement appears to misrepresent the identity of the car and driver is not a false or misleading statement within the meaning of the test articulated above. C is incorrect. The cigarette maker may have a claim for misappropriation of the driver\u2019s identity, but he will have to satisfy the Gertz test for a celebrity plaintiff.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The owner of the plant has imposed strict safety measures to prevent an explosion at the plant.

The driver of the car brought a strict liability action against the owner of the plant to recover for the damage to the car\u2019s windshield. Is the driver likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the damage to the windshield did not result from the abnormally dangerous aspect of the plant\u2019s activity.\nB. No, because the severity of the windstorm was unusual.\nC. Yes, because the plant\u2019s activity was abnormally dangerous.\nD. Yes, because the plant\u2019s location near a busy highway was abnormally dangerous.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The driver is not seeking recovery for the damage to the windshield but rather for the injury to himself that resulted from the shattered windshield. This action is based on the theory of proximate cause. The driver cannot recover for the injury to himself unless the volatile materials that exploded can be characterized as a proximate cause of the harm to himself. The explosion of highly volatile materials is an unusual and non-foreseeable consequence of the storing and using of such materials. Therefore, the driver will probably prevail. A is incorrect. Even if the unusual windstorm were not a factor, the storage and use of the explosives would still have set in motion a chain of events that could not have been foreseen to result in injury to a passerby. Therefore, the driver is likely to prevail. B is incorrect. Whether the windstorm was unusual or not is irrelevant to the determination of proximate cause. The driver is seeking recovery for the injury to himself resulting from the shattered windshield, and the explosion of highly volatile materials is an unusual and non-foreseeable consequence of the storing and using of such materials. Therefore, the driver will probably prevail. D is incorrect. Plants located near busy highways present a common danger that is not abnormally dangerous simply because it is present. For a risk to be considered abnormally dangerous, it must be greater than ordinary risks of everyday life. The fact that the plant was located near a busy highway is a common danger that is not abnormally dangerous simply because it is present. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

Soon after the purchase, the consumer was using the blender in an appropriate way when the blender jar shattered, throwing a piece of glass into the consumer\u2019s eye. The consumer brought an action against the manufacturer based solely on strict product liability. The consumer\u2019s expert testified that the blender was defectively designed. However, because the blender jar was destroyed in the accident, the expert could not determine whether the accident was caused by the design defect or a manufacturing defect. The manufacturer\u2019s expert testified that the blender was not defective. If, at the conclusion of the evidence, both parties move for directed verdicts, how should the trial judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

A directed verdict is a motion by a party for the court to order a verdict for that party as to a particular issue for which the jury has not yet determined. Here, both the consumer and the manufacturer made a motion for a directed verdict. The manufacturer\u2019s motion should be denied because a jury could reasonably find that the defect that caused the blender to malfunction was present when the blender was new and sold to the consumer. This is a decision for the consumer. A is incorrect. The consumer\u2019s inability to specify the nature of the defect is irrelevant. When deciding a motion for a directed verdict, the court considers whether there is sufficient evidence for a jury to find for the non-moving party. Thus, the fact that the consumer\u2019s expert was unable to specify the nature of the defect is irrelevant because the consumer\u2019s expert testimony was not the only evidence presented on the issue.

A substantial interference is an interference that is offensive or annoying to the average person in the community--the plaintiff's hypersensitivities are irrelevant. An unreasonable interference is an interference where the severity of the inflicted injury outweighs the utility of the defendant's conduct.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The company is not liable for the simple fact that its press was the cause in fact of the worker\u2019s injury. A defendant will only be found liable for a consequence if his act was a cause in fact (as opposed to merely a remote cause) of the consequence. In this case, the worker\u2019s injury was a proximate consequence of his employer\u2019s purchasing the stamping press without the installed safety device. However, the worker\u2019s employer\u2019s decision to buy the press without the installed safety device was a superseding cause of the worker\u2019s injury, which relieved the company of liability for the worker\u2019s injury.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. While the driver may be liable for battery, assault, or negligence, punitive damages are not available as a remedy under any of those causes of action. While it is possible that the driver may have acted with malice aforethought, which would allow for a claim for punitive damages as a remedy for battery or assault, the fact that the driver may have intentionally injured his friend by swerving the truck does not mean that the driver will be subject to punitive damages. Negligence and recklessness are also inadequate causes of action for the recovery of punitive damages. Although the driver\u2019s actions may have been grossly negligent, or even reckless, punitive damages are not available as a remedy under those causes of action. A is incorrect because battery is a form of intentional tort that allows for punitive damages as a remedy. C is incorrect because negligence and recklessness are also forms of intentional torts that allow for punitive damages as a remedy.

The owner of the building had installed the automatic door. The lease, pursuant to which the supermarket leased the building, provided that the supermarket was responsible for all maintenance of the premises. The shopper sued the supermarket.

At the conclusion of the proofs, both the shopper and the supermarket moved for judgment. How should the trial judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Although this looks like a products liability case, it is a negligence action. The supermarket had a duty to keep the premises in safe condition, and to warn its invitees of any dangerous condition thereon. The door\u2019s malfunctioning would ordinarily create liability, as would the supermarket\u2019s failure to warn of the dangerous condition. However, negligence must be proved, and here the shopper failed to offer any evidence as to what caused the door to open inward. Therefore, both motions for judgment should be denied, and the case should be submitted to the jury for its determination. A is incorrect. It is true that mere existence of a proximate cause of action does not necessarily prove negligence. However, in this case, the malfunction of the door would ordinarily give rise to a claim for negligence, and the supermarket\u2019s failure to warn invitees of the dangerous condition would also give rise to a claim for negligence.

The heir\u2019s only possible interest would be a possibility of reverter retained by the landowner which passed to the heir by virtue of the conveyance. However, the conveyance to the church was also made subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities. The Rule Against Perpetuities prohibits a grantor from making a grant to a beneficiary who has a life in being plus 21 years. In this case, the 21-year period ended with the demise of the church. Because the grant was made subject to this rule, it is void. Therefore, the heir\u2019s only interest would be the possibility of reverter retained by the landowner and passed to the heir by conveyance, which is now also void. The attorney general will prevail because a charity cannot convey assets donated to it. The charity\u2019s interest must remain in the asset indefinitely. If the asset is donated to a charity with the understanding that it could be sold, the sale of the asset would be a violation of the trust. Because the landowner conveyed the land to the church \u201cso long as the land is used as the site for the principal religious edifice maintained by said church,\u201d and because the church ceased to exist and demolished its church building, the conveyance to the church was also void. There is no applicable statute to save the conveyance. A is incorrect because the landowner\u2019s interest will also terminate automatically with the church\u2019s demolition of its church building. B is incorrect because a conveyance to a charity is valid so long as the charity\u2019s purposes are furthered by the use of the asset. In this case, the landowner\u2019s conveyance was subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities and was void. There is no applicable statute to save the conveyance. D is incorrect because the Rule Against Perpetuities does not violate a conveyance; rather, the conveyance must violate the Rule Against Perpetuities to be void. Because the conveyance to the church created a fee simple determinable with an end point in time, the Rule Against Perpetuities would not violate it. The conveyance is void because of the Rule Against Perpetuities, not because it violates the Rule.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

A buyer gave the seller a signed handwritten offer to purchase the house. The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller\u2019s home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance. The buyer declared the contract voided by the fire, but the seller asserted a right to enforce the contract despite the loss. There is no applicable statute. If a court finds for the seller, what is the likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The contract was construed against the buyer, who drafted it.\nB. The lender\u2019s written commitment to make a mortgage loan to the buyer made the contract of sale fully binding on the\nbuyer.\nC.

A is incorrect because it is the party with the equitable title who bears the risk, not the party who drafted the contract. B is incorrect because a lender\u2019s mortgage loan commitment does not make a contract fully binding.

The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her. After the farmer promptly and properly recorded that deed, the second bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the farm. The farmer denied the validity of the second bank\u2019s mortgage. Does the second bank continue to have a valid mortgage on the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of estoppel by deed.\nB.

No, because the purchase at the foreclosure sale by the buyer under these facts eliminated the second bank\u2019s junior\nmortgage lien.\nD.

Therefore, the sale of the farm to the buyer was not a violation of the due-on-sale provision, and the second bank\u2019s mortgage remains valid. A is incorrect because estoppel by deed only applies when a third party is unsuccessful in its bid at a foreclosure sale. Because the original owner reacquired title to the farm, estoppel by deed is not applicable.

The contract stipulated that the seller would deliver to the buyer, upon the payment of the last installment due, \u201ca warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\u201d The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The buyer entered into possession of the land. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the buyer discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on the land, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25 percent of the purchase price that the buyer had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the seller had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the seller. The value of the land was then four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller\u2019s alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the buyer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nB. Yes, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a mortgage and the outstanding mortgage impairs the\nbuyer\u2019s equity of redemption.\nC. No, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a security device.\nD. No, because the time for the seller to deliver marketable title has not arrived.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. An installment land contract is treated as a security device rather than a mortgage. Although an installment land contract may contain a provision that the title will be marketable or that the seller will deliver a warranty deed, the presence of such a provision does not make the contract a mortgage. Where the contract fails to state that time is of the essence, the remedies available to the buyer include the right to cancel the contract and to recover damages for the seller\u2019s alleged breach. Because the contract did not state that time was of the essence, the buyer\u2019s failure to pay the last installment and his quitclaim of title are not consequences of the seller\u2019s alleged breach but rather constitute the buyer\u2019s exercising his rights under the contract.

A mortgage can render title unmarketable but it is most likely that title will be marketable when all payments have been made by the buyer under the agreement. The seller has made all mortgage payments timely. The amount of the mortgage debt is 25 percent of the purchase price the buyer will pay, and the land is four times more valuable than the debt owed, so it is likely that the mortgage debt will be paid off by the time the seller must provide the warranty deed, and thus the buyer is not entitled to damages at this time.",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder.

The contract stated, \u201cThe parties agree that closing will occur on next May 1 at 10 a.m.\u201d There was no other reference to closing. The contract was silent as to quality of title. On April 27, the seller notified the buyer that she had discovered that the land was subject to a longstanding easement in favor of a corporation for a towpath for a canal, should the corporation ever want to build a canal. The buyer thought it so unlikely that a canal would be built that the closing should occur notwithstanding this outstanding easement. Therefore, the buyer notified the seller on April 28 that he would expect to close on May 1. When the seller refused to close, the buyer sued for specific performance. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the easement renders the seller\u2019s title unmarketable.\nB. No, because rights of third parties are unresolved.\nC. Yes, because the decision to terminate the contract for title not being marketable belongs only to the buyer.\nD. Yes, because the seller did not give notice of the easement a reasonable time before the closing date.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The seller\u2019s refusal to close because of the outstanding easement means that the seller has repudiated the contract. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect. While it is true that only the buyer has the right to terminate for title not being marketable, the seller has a duty to disclose facts that could reasonably be considered to have a material impact on the value of the property. In this case, the easement means that the value of the property will be reduced by the presence of the canal should it be built. Therefore, the seller\u2019s nondisclosure of this easement constitutes a breach of the contract, and the buyer has the right to terminate the contract. Answer D is incorrect.

The applicable zoning ordinance required that a buildable lot contain at least two acres and have frontage of not less than 100 feet on a public street. A brother and sister owned the land as tenants in common, the brother owning a one-third interest and the sister owning a two-thirds interest. Neither of them owned any other real property. The sister brought an appropriate action to partition the land and proposed that a two-acre rectangular lot with 100 feet of frontage be set off to her and that a one-acre rectangular lot with 50 feet of frontage be set off to the brother. The brother\u2019s defense included a demand that the land be sold and its proceeds be divided one-third to the brother and two-thirds to the sister. Who will prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The brother, because partition by sale is the preferred remedy, unless a fair price is not the likely result of a sale.\nB. The brother, because the zoning ordinance makes it impossible to divide the land fairly.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. A tenant in common may bring an action to partition the property. Partition in kind, in which there is a physical division of the common property, is not appropriate where, after a fair and reasonable physical division, two or more parties still would own different, fractional interest in the property. In such cases, a partition by sale is required. However, a sale may not be appropriate where a fair and reasonable physical division of the property is possible. Where the subject property can be physically divided, as is the case with the land in this fact pattern, a partition by sale is not appropriate. Instead, the parties must be ordered to physically divide the land. B is incorrect because the zoning ordinance is irrelevant to the determination of whether a physical or a sale partition is appropriate. A is incorrect because the preference for a sale partition is not absolute and is not applicable where, as here, a physical division of the property is possible.

Fifteen years ago, after a part of the path located on his land and connecting his cabin to the public highway washed out, the man cleared a small part of his neighbor\u2019s land and rerouted a section of the path through the neighbor\u2019s land. Twelve years ago, the neighbor leased her land to some hunters. For the next 12 years, the hunters and the man who had rerouted the path used the path for access to the highway. A month ago, the neighbor discovered that part of the path was on her land. The neighbor told the man that she had not given him permission to cross her land and that she would be closing the rerouted path after 90 days. The man\u2019s land and the neighbor\u2019s land have never been in common ownership. The period of time necessary to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The period of time necessary to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. What should the lawyer tell the man concerning his right to use the rerouted path on the neighbor\u2019s land?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The man has fee title by adverse possession of the land included in the path.\nB. The man has an easement by necessity to use the path.\nC.

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \u201cIt is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\u201d Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor\u2019s intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor\u2019s proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owners of lots in the subdivision own property benefitted by the original residential covenant and\nhave the sole right to enforce it.\nB. No, because the man owns property benefitted by the original restrictive covenant and has a right to enforce it.\nC. Yes, because the original restrictive covenant violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nD. Yes, because the zoning ordinance allows the doctor\u2019s proposed use and preempts the restrictive covenant.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The facts indicate that the man and the developer created a restrictive covenant that applies to the 40-acre tract of land. That covenant prohibits any use of the land except for residential purposes. Although the 40 lots within the subdivision have changed hands multiple times, the deeds for each of those transfers did not mention the restrictive covenant, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants. The doctor is the first person attempting to use her land for nonresidential purposes since the covenant was put in place 25 years ago. The man, whose land is still available for use as a nonresidential site, objects to the doctor\u2019s proposed use of her land. The doctor\u2019s proposed use of her land would violate the rule against perpetuities (RAP) because the doctor\u2019s interest must fail before all others interests named in the covenant. Because the doctor\u2019s interest is the latest in time, it cannot survive the other interests, including the man\u2019s interest. A is incorrect because the doctor, like all other lot owners in the subdivision, has the right to enforce the covenant. B is incorrect because the doctor\u2019s right to enforce the covenant means that she cannot be adversely affected by the man\u2019s ability to enforce the covenant. Both the doctor and the man have an equal right to enforce the covenant. D is incorrect because zoning ordinances do not preempt local land use restrictions, such as restrictive covenants.

The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000. The buyer knew nothing of the friend\u2019s mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot. Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her bank of the mortgage claimed by the investor\u2019s friend, the bank loaned her $15,000, and she gave the bank a note for $15,000 due in two years secured by a mortgage on the lot. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. At that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cNo conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\u201d Both notes are now due and both the investor and the buyer have refused to pay. The lot is now worth only $50,000. What are the rights of the investor\u2019s friend and the bank in the lot?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both mortgages are enforceable liens and the friend\u2019s has priority because it was first recorded.\nB. Both mortgages are enforceable liens, but the bank\u2019s has priority because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for\nvalue.\nC. Only the friend\u2019s mortgage is an enforceable lien, because the bank had actual and constructive notice of the\ninvestor\u2019s fraud.\nD.

To prevail under a notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded his or her deed without notice of earlier purchasers. In this case, the investor conveyed the lot to the buyer without notice of the friend's mortgage, thus giving the buyer BFP status. The friend, however, had no reason to record his mortgage prior to the bank's action, since he knew that the lot was already encumbered by a mortgage. Because the bank had no reason to be on notice of the friend's mortgage, the bank's priority over the friend's mortgage does not depend on whether the buyer was an innocent purchaser.

The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee\u2019s will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. The grantee\u2019s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might\nhave.\nC.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Under UCC \u00a7 2-509(1), a contract that requires the seller to ship goods to the buyer by a third-party carrier is either a shipment or a destination contract. Comment 5 to UCC \u00a7 2-509 states that where the contract is silent as to who is to pay the costs of carriage, the presumption under UCC \u00a7 2-509(2) is that the buyer is to pay. Therefore, because the contract was silent as to who was to pay the costs of carriage, the presumption is that the buyer is to pay and the risk of loss would pass from the seller to the buyer when the carrier was duly instructed to carry the goods. A is incorrect because the risk would not pass when the contract was made since the goods were identified to the contract at that time. B is incorrect because the risk would not pass when the bracelets were identified to the contract since the goods conformed to the contract.

In return, the client agreed to pay the architect a fee of $10,000 to be paid upon the house\u2019s completion. After completion, the client claimed erroneously but in good faith that the architect\u2019s plans were defective. The client orally offered to pay the architect $7,500 in full settlement of the claim for the fee. The architect orally accepted that offer despite the fact that the reasonable value of his services was in fact $10,000. The client paid the architect $7,500 pursuant to their agreement. The architect subsequently sued the client for the remaining $2,500. In a preliminary finding, the trier of fact found that there were no defects in the architect\u2019s plans. Will the architect be likely to prevail in his action against the client for $2,500?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because payment of $7,500 cannot furnish consideration for the architect\u2019s promise to surrender his claim.\nB. Yes, because the oral agreement to modify the written contract is not enforceable.\nC. No, because the architect\u2019s promise to accept $7,500 became binding when the client made the payment.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. A provision in a written contract that calls for payment of a specified sum upon the happening of a specified event is a promise, not a condition. Therefore, when the architect agreed to accept $7,500 upon the completion of the house, he made a promise, not a condition, and his acceptance of the payment was enforceable, whether express or implied. Because the architect\u2019s promise to accept $7,500 is enforceable, his promise to accept only $7,500 cannot be enforceable, and the client\u2019s payment of $7,500 cannot furnish consideration to support the architect\u2019s promise to surrender his claim. A is incorrect. Even if the provision in the written contract had been a condition, the architect\u2019s promise to accept $7,500 upon completion would still be enforceable, whether express or implied. C is incorrect. Payment of the agreed sum is not a condition that must occur before the architect\u2019s promise to accept $7,500 becomes enforceable. D is incorrect.

Total destruction of goods is a supervening event that relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract, and therefore the contract may be rescinded on grounds of supervening impossibility. A is incorrect because the avoidance of the contract relates to the buyer\u2019s obligation to pay $20,000 for the car, and not to the seller\u2019s obligation to deliver the car.

Here, the bank\u2019s offer invited acceptance only by performance--by standing in line for five minutes. When the customer began performing by standing in line, the offer was accepted and the bank was not free to revoke its offer. B is incorrect.

On June 5, the buyer bought a second tract of land at a higher price as a substitute for the first tract. On June 10, the seller communicated a retraction of the repudiation to the buyer. The buyer did not tender the purchase price for the first tract on July 1, but subsequently sued the seller for breach of contract. Will the buyer likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the seller retracted the repudiation prior to the agreed time for performance.\nB. No, because the buyer\u2019s tender of the purchase price on July 1 was a constructive condition to the seller\u2019s duty to\ntender a conveyance.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. When the buyer received the seller's repudiation on June 1, the contract was terminated and the buyer was discharged from any further obligation under the contract. However, because the repudiation was nonretractable, the seller was also discharged from any further obligation under the contract. When the seller retracted the repudiation on June 10, he was attempting to re-enter into a contract that had already been terminated by the repudiation. Therefore, the buyer is not likely to prevail. A is incorrect because a retraction of a repudiation does not revive a terminated contract; instead, it allows the parties to enter into a modified contract.

The builder orally offered to perform the work for $200,000 if his pending bid on another project was rejected. The homeowner accepted the builder\u2019s terms and the builder then prepared a written contract that both parties signed. The contract did not refer to the builder\u2019s pending bid. One week later, upon learning that his pending bid on the other project had been accepted, the builder refused to perform any work for the homeowner. Can the homeowner recover for the builder\u2019s nonperformance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because efficiency principles justify the builder\u2019s services being directed to a higher-valued use.\nB. No, because the builder\u2019s duty to perform was subject to a condition.\nC. Yes, because the builder\u2019s attempt to condition his duty to perform rendered the contract illusory.\nD. Yes, because the parol evidence rule would bar the builder from presenting evidence of oral understandings not\nincluded in the final writing.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. A duty of performance is subject to a condition when the duty is contingent upon the occurrence of a subsequent event, or there is a possibility of its occurrence, so that the person subject to the duty may reasonably be expected to wish or plan for the event. When the builder and the homeowner agreed that the builder would perform the addition for $200,000 only if his bid on another project was rejected, the builder\u2019s duty was subject to a condition. If the condition occurs, then the duty to perform arises, and if it does not occur, the duty does not arise. Therefore, while the builder\u2019s pending bid on another project is a condition to the builder\u2019s duty, it is not certain to occur. It is possible that the builder\u2019s bid on the other project will be accepted, in which case the condition will not occur and the builder will not have to perform his contract with the homeowner. Therefore, the homeowner will not prevail, because efficiency principles support the builder\u2019s use of his time and money in pursuit of a higher-valued opportunity. A is incorrect because even if efficiency justified the builder\u2019s breach, the homeowner could still recover for the builder\u2019s nonperformance because the contract is not silent on the issue of conditions. C is incorrect because a condition will not render a contract illusory. Although the effect of an illusory condition may be to make a contract illusory, the condition will not, by itself, render a contract illusory. D is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not bar the presentation of evidence of oral understandings that conflict with the writing. When the parties orally agreed that the builder would perform only if his bid on another project was rejected, they were not trying to modify the writing; they were agreeing to its terms.

The contract price was $100,000 in cash, payable one month after a truck carrier delivered the painting to the collector. The painting was damaged in transit. The collector timely rejected it after inspection and immediately notified the gallery of the rejection. The gallery then sold the painting to a third party. It informed the collector that it would pick up the painting within a couple of weeks. Two weeks later, before the gallery picked up the painting, the collector sold the painting to an art admirer for $120,000 cash, after notifying her about the damage. If the collector\u2019s sale of the painting was NOT an acceptance of the goods, what is the maximum amount that the gallery is entitled to recover from the collector?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $120,000 (damages for conversion).\nB. $100,000 (the collector-gallery contract price).\nC. $20,000 (the excess of the market price over the contract price).\nD.

A is incorrect because the collector\u2019s sale of the painting was not a wrongful taking, but rather the exercise of his rightful ownership of the goods after his original rejection. In addition, the collector\u2019s sale was done without the gallery\u2019s knowledge or consent and was not done with the intent to deprive the gallery of its goods.

The contract expressly required that the excavator begin work on June 1 to enable other subcontractors to install utilities. On May 15, the excavator requested a 30-day delay in the start date for the excavation work because he was seriously behind schedule on another project. When the contractor refused to grant the delay, the excavator stated that he would try to begin the work for the contractor on June 1. Does the contractor have valid legal grounds to cancel the contract with the excavator and hire a replacement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the excavator committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract by causing the contractor to feel\ninsecure about the performance.\nB. Yes, because the excavator breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nC. No, because the excavator would be entitled to specific performance of the contract if he could begin by June 1.\nD. No, because the excavator did not state unequivocally that he would delay the beginning of his work.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's contractual obligation is conditioned upon the occurrence of a stated event, even if that event is outside of the party's control. However, the duty to perform becomes absolute once the event has occurred. Therefore, if the excavator's delay in beginning work is not material to the contractor's overall project schedule, the contractor will have a valid legal basis for canceling the contract and hiring a replacement for the excavator. A is incorrect. Even if the excavator's conduct were to cause the contractor to feel insecure about the performance, the contract would not be automatically rescindable. If the excavator's delay is not material to the contractor's overall project schedule, the contractor will have a valid legal basis for canceling the contract and hiring a replacement for the excavator. B is incorrect. The excavator did not commit a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Under this implied covenant, a party must act in good faith and deal fairly with the other party. Therefore, simply requesting a delay in a contractual obligation does not constitute a bad faith act. D is incorrect. The excavator's request for a delay does not constitute an unequivocal statement that he will delay his performance.

The clerk\u2019s position would be terminated due to the dissolution, and he did not have a retirement plan. The accountant and the bookkeeper informed the clerk of their plan to fund an annuity for him. The clerk, confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity, purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100,000 to fund the annuity, but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50,000. The accountant agreed that the bookkeeper should contribute only $50,000. Does the clerk have a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the clerk was bound by the modification of the agreement made by the accountant and the bookkeeper.\nB. No, because the clerk was only a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper, and\nhad no vested rights.\nC. Yes, because the clerk\u2019s reliance on the promised retirement fund prevented the parties from changing the terms.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Generally, third party rights are not enforceable unless the party seeking enforcement is a bona fide beneficiary of the contract who has relied on the promises in the contract. The clerk is a bona fide beneficiary of the contract between the accountant and the bookkeeper because the promises to fund the annuity were made to benefit the clerk. The facts state that the clerk purchased a retirement home in reliance on the promised funding of an annuity, which indicates that the clerk had a substantial reliance interest. Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect as the facts demonstrate that the clerk had a vested right in the promised funding.

On March 2, the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer\u2019s order was for a rush job, the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day\u2019s delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25,000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25,000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5,000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid, which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic\u2019s best defense to the textile company\u2019s action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Time was not of the essence in the contract between the mechanic and the textile company.\nB.
