The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The homeowner broke his arm when he slipped and fell from the ladder. The furnace had no warnings or instructions on how it was to be cleaned. In a suit by the homeowner against the manufacturer of the furnace to recover for his injury, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the danger of falling from a ladder is obvious.\nB. No, because the homeowner should have hired a professional to clean the furnace.\nC.

Fortunately, the phone rang and awakened the student. The roommate retreated quickly and threw the ice pick under his own bed in the same room. The next day, the student heard from friends about the roommate\u2019s murderous plans and later found the ice pick under the roommate\u2019s bed. Even though the college expelled his roommate, the student remained extremely upset and afraid to sleep. In a suit against the roommate for assault, will the student prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the roommate did not touch the student.\nB. No, because the student was not awake when the roommate entered the room and was unaware until later that the\nroommate was intending to attack him.\nC. Yes, because it was reasonable for the student to feel afraid of sleeping in his room afterward.\nD. Yes, because the roommate intended to inflict serious harm.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The roommate\u2019s intention to commit an assault was clearly manifested by his having armed himself with an ice pick and by his threatening words. The victim need not have been aware of the roommate\u2019s intent or even have suffered any harmful contact to prevail in an assault claim. While the roommate\u2019s failure to touch the student may be a defense to a battery claim, it is not a defense to an assault claim. A is incorrect. The roommate\u2019s mere presence in the room, even if he did not intend to harm the student, would be sufficient to cause the student to reasonably fear for his safety. B is incorrect.

Vehicles made by the manufacturer of the motorist\u2019s car have been found to be negligently designed, making them dangerously prone to rolling over when they suffer blowouts. A truck driver who was driving behind the motorist when the accident occurred stopped to help. Rescue vehicles promptly arrived, and the truck driver walked along the side of the road to return to his truck. As he approached his truck, he was struck and injured by a speeding car. The truck driver has sued the manufacturer of the injured motorist\u2019s car. Is the truck driver likely to prevail in a suit against the car manufacturer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the car manufacturer\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of the truck driver\u2019s injuries.\nB. No, because the truck driver assumed the risk of injury when he undertook to help the motorist.\nC. Yes, because it is foreseeable that injuries can result from rollovers.\nD. Yes, because the car manufacturer\u2019s negligence caused the dangerous situation that invited the rescue by the truck\ndriver.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The manufacturer of the car that suffered the blowout is liable for the harm to the truck driver, who was a rescuer, unless the harm is unforeseeable. It is foreseeable that injuries could result from a rollover, and it is foreseeable that a passerby would attempt to rescue the occupants of the car. Therefore, the manufacturer is liable for the harm to the truck driver. A is incorrect. The proximate cause of an injury is not a defense to a rescuer\u2019s claim against the negligent manufacturer of the vehicle in which the person being rescued was injured. The fact that the injury to the truck driver was not a proximate consequence of the car manufacturer\u2019s negligence does not defeat the truck driver\u2019s claim. B is incorrect. The truck driver may have been in the zone of danger, but that does not defeat his claim against the car manufacturer. C is incorrect. The fact that the injury was foreseeable does not defeat the truck driver\u2019s claim against the car manufacturer.

The farmhouse had been broken into several times in the past, and some of the farmer\u2019s goods had been stolen. Instead of posting \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, the farmer decided to install an alarm system to deter intruders. While the farmer was in the farmhouse installing the alarm system, he heard a window open in the adjoining room. The farmer crept very quietly to the door of the room, threw the door open, and found an intruder, a young child. The farmer immediately struck the child, a 10-year-old girl, very hard in the face, breaking her nose. In an action on behalf of the child against the farmer to recover for the injury to her nose, is the child likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the farmer did not use deadly force.\nB. No, because the farmer had probable cause to believe that the child was a thief.\nC. Yes, because the farmer should have posted a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign.\nD. Yes, because the farmer used excessive force.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The farmer should have posted a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign to warn intruders that they were entering private property and to deter them from doing so. Instead, the farmer, believing that he could identify a thief by sight, decided to catch one intruder in the act. By doing so, he used excessive force. The farmer\u2019s use of force in breaking the child\u2019s nose is likely to be found to be unnecessary and therefore, excessive. A is incorrect. The child can state a claim for battery because there was an intentional infliction of a harmful contact to her person resulting in her nose being broken. The fact that the contact was not done with deadly force does not negate the fact that it was done with sufficient force to cause harmful contact. B is incorrect. The farmer\u2019s belief that the child was a thief is irrelevant because the farmer\u2019s belief must be reasonable to be a defense. Because the farmer believed that he could identify a thief by sight, his belief that the child was a thief is not reasonable, and it is irrelevant that it may have been correct. C is incorrect. The fact that the child may have been a thief is irrelevant to the farmer\u2019s use of force. The farmer\u2019s belief that the child was a thief is not a defense to the battery claim because it was not a reasonable belief.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

The mining company\u2019s best defense is that it took reasonable precautions to store the dynamite. Keeping dynamite in a storage facility that conformed to state-of-the-art safety standards is a taking reasonable precautions. A is incorrect because the location of the mine is irrelevant to the determination of whether the storage of dynamite is abnormally dangerous.

When the neighbor came over the fence, the rancher shot him, inflicting serious injury. In a battery action brought by the neighbor against the rancher, the rancher testified that he actually thought his neighbor was armed, although he could point to nothing that would have reasonably justified this belief.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The accusation was untrue. The editor acted unreasonably in not investigating the accusation before publishing it; however, the editor honestly believed that the accusation was true. The candidate sued the editor for defamation. Is the candidate entitled to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the accusation appeared in an editorial and was, therefore, merely an opinion.\nB. No, because the editor honestly believed that the accusation was true.\nC. Yes, because calling someone an illegal drug user is defamatory per se.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. To bring a claim for defamation, a plaintiff must establish the following common law elements: (i) defamatory language, (ii) \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff, (iii) publication of the defamatory language by the defendant to a third person, and (iv) damage to the plaintiff's reputation. However, in a defamation action that involves a matter of public concern--here, a claim brought by a candidate for public office--the plaintiff must establish more than mere negligence with regard to the truth or falsity of the allegedly defamatory statement of fact. The plaintiff must establish that the defendant acted with actual malice, that is, that the defendant in fact knew the statement to be false or entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the statement. Here, the candidate cannot establish actual malice on the part of the editor in publishing the statement because the editor honestly believed the accusation was true. A is incorrect because the assertion that the candidate was an illegal drug user is not an opinion. Such a statement is either true or false. It is false in this case, so the candidate can establish a claim for defamation per se. C is incorrect because defamation per se requires proof of the falsity of the statement, and here the candidate cannot establish that the statement is false. D is incorrect because the candidate must establish more than mere negligence with regard to the truth of the statement; he must establish that the editor acted with actual malice, and here he cannot do so because the editor honestly believed the accusation was true.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

One day the teenager, driving the neighbor\u2019s car, took the neighbor to the grocery store. While the neighbor was in the store, the teenager drove out of the parking lot and headed for a party on the other side of town. While on his way to the party, the teenager negligently turned in front of a moving car and caused a collision. The other driver was injured in the collision. The injured driver has brought an action for damages against the neighbor, based on negligent entrustment, and against the teenager. The jury has found that the injured driver\u2019s damages were $100,000, that the injured driver was 10% at fault, that the teenager was 60% at fault, and that the neighbor was 30% at fault for entrusting his car to the teenager.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The injured driver\u2019s claim against the neighbor is based on negligent entrustment. Under a negligent entrustment claim, if the entrustor is found to have placed his car in the hands of a reckless driver, the entrustor is liable for any damage done by the driver in the use of the car. The driver\u2019s claim against the neighbor is based on the facts that the neighbor entrusted his car to the teenager, who was reckless in the use of the car, and that the use of the car by the teenager resulted in the collision that injured the driver. The neighbor, as the entrustor, is liable for the negligent entrustment of his car to the teenager, and his liability is limited by the negligence of the teenager and the driver. In this case, the jury found that the teenager was 60% at fault and the driver was 10% at fault. Therefore, the neighbor, who was 30% at fault, is liable for 30% of the damages, which is $30,000. A is incorrect because the neighbor is liable for the negligent entrustment of his car to the teenager, and his liability is limited by the negligence of the teenager and the driver.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landlord and a tenant orally agreed to a commercial tenancy for a term of six months beginning on July 1. Rent was to be paid by the first day of each month, and the tenant paid the first month\u2019s rent at the time of the agreement. When the tenant arrived at the leased premises on July 1, the tenant learned that the previous tenant had not vacated the premises at the end of her lease term on May 31 and did not intend to vacate. The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession. The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. By suing the previous tenant for possession, the tenant elected that remedy in lieu of a suit against the landlord.\nB. The landlord had delivered the legal right of possession to the tenant.\nC. The tenant failed to timely vacate as required to sue for constructive eviction.\nD. The tenant had not notified the landlord before bringing the eviction action.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The landlord granted the legal right of possession to the tenant, which means that neither the landlord nor anyone holding of the landlord prevented the tenant from going into possession at the commencement of the lease term. The previous tenant\u2019s lease term had ended before the new lease term began. As stated in the question, the previous tenant did not vacate at the end of her lease term and was not holding of the landlord. The previous tenant\u2019s continued occupancy of the premises prevented the landlord from removing his personal property and thereby deprived the landlord of his reversion. As stated in the question, the court found for the landlord, and B is the most likely explanation for that finding. A is incorrect because the suit against the previous tenant for possession was not a substitute for a suit against the landlord but rather was a separate and distinct action. C is incorrect because the tenant\u2019s failure to vacate within a reasonable time after the lease term ended is not a constructive eviction but rather a forfeiture of the tenant\u2019s right to the return of the demised premises.

The cousin then entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to an investor with the closing to take place \u201cone week after [the cousin\u2019s] next birthday.\u201d The man failed to convey the farm to the cousin on her birthday. One week after the cousin\u2019s birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin\u2019s inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise. The investor considered suing the cousin but realized that she could not compel the cousin to convey the farm because it was still owned by the man. Two weeks after the cousin\u2019s birthday, the man died. Under his valid will, the man devised the farm to the cousin. Within a week, the executor of the man\u2019s estate gave the cousin an executor\u2019s deed to the farm in compliance with state law. The investor promptly learned of this transfer and demanded that the cousin convey the farm to her. The cousin refused. The investor sued the cousin for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The cousin, because the contract to convey was not signed by the legal owner of the farm as of the date of the contract\nand was therefore void.\nB. The cousin, because she received title by devise rather than by conveyance.\nC. The investor, because the contract to convey merged into the executor\u2019s deed to the cousin.\nD.

After the mother\u2019s death and with the daughter\u2019s permission, the son took sole possession of the farm and agreed to pay the daughter a stipulated monthly rent.

A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cAny judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\u201d Six months later, the son died. There are no other applicable statutes. Is the creditor entitled to enforce its judgment lien against the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter became sole owner of the farm free and clear of the creditor\u2019s judgment lien when the son\ndied.\nB. No, because the son\u2019s interest was severed from the daughter\u2019s interest upon the filing of the lien.\nC.

The lender promptly recorded the mortgage. A year later, the landowner conveyed the same tract to a developer by a deed that expressly stated that the conveyance was subject to the mortgage to the lender and that the grantee expressly assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage obligation as part of the consideration for the purchase. The mortgage was properly described in the deed, and the deed was properly executed by the landowner; however, because there was no provision or place in the deed for the developer to sign, he did not do so. The developer promptly recorded the deed. The developer made the monthly mortgage payments of principal and interest for six payments but then stopped payments and defaulted on the mortgage obligation. The lender properly instituted foreclosure procedures in accordance with the governing law. After the foreclosure sale, there was a $10,000 deficiency due to the lender.

The deed contained a covenant by the grantee as owner of the vacant tract that neither he nor his heirs or assigns would \u201cerect any building\u201d on the vacant tract, in order to preserve the view of the river from the commercial building on the improved tract. The grantee intended to use the vacant tract as a nature preserve. The grantee promptly and properly recorded the deed. Last year, the businesswoman conveyed the improved tract to a businessman. A month later, the grantee died, devising all of his property, including the vacant land, to his cousin. Six weeks ago, the cousin began construction of a building on the vacant tract. The businessman objected and sued to enjoin construction of the building. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The businessman, because the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project.\nB.

A neighbor who owned the property immediately adjacent to the land wrongfully began to possess the land at that time. For 24 of the next 25 years, the neighbor planted and harvested crops on the land, hunted on it, and parked cars on it. However, in the sixth year after he first took possession of the land, the neighbor neither planted crops nor hunted nor parked cars on the land because he spent that entire year living in Europe. The neighbor built a small gardening shed on the land, but he never built a residence on it. When the daughter was 28, she was declared mentally incompetent and had a conservator appointed to oversee her affairs. Since then, she has continuously resided in a care facility. The applicable statute of limitations provides as follows: \u201cAn ejectment action shall be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues, but if the person entitled to bring the cause of action is under age 18 or mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues, it may be brought by such person within 10 years after attaining age 18 or after the person becomes competent.\u201d If the daughter\u2019s conservator wins an ejectment action against the neighbor, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter was age 17 when the neighbor first took possession of the land.\nB. Because the daughter is mentally incompetent, the statute of limitations has been tolled.\nC. The neighbor never built a residence on the land.\nD. The neighbor was not in continuous possession of the land for 21 years.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. An adverse claimant may obtain title by adverse possession if the claimant: 1) has been in possession of the land for the length of time prescribed by statute, 2) maintained that possession continuously and without interruption, 3) had \"hostile\" possession (that is, did not possess the land under a lease or other agreement with the true owner), and 4) maintained \"open and notorious\" possession. In this case, the statute of limitations for ejectment actions in the jurisdiction is 21 years. The neighbor has been in possession of the land for 24 of the last 25 years, and has maintained that possession continuously and without interruption. Therefore, the neighbor's possession should be considered \"hostile\" and \"open and notorious.\" However, because the land has been vacant for the last six years and the neighbor has not built a residence on it, the neighbor's possession has not been \"continuous\" within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect because the daughter's age at the time of the neighbor's first possession is irrelevant to the statute of limitations analysis.

The buyer purchased a title insurance policy running to both the buyer and the bank, showing no liens on the property other than the buyer\u2019s mortgage to the bank. Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances. As a result of a title examiner\u2019s negligence, this mortgage was not disclosed in the title insurance policy issued to the buyer and the bank. Following this discovery, the donee successfully sued the buyer to recover the amount of the outstanding mortgage. If the buyer sues the title insurance company to recover the amount he paid to the donee, is he likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the buyer conveyed the land to an investor.\nB. No, because the title insurance policy lapsed when the buyer paid off the bank\u2019s mortgage.\nC. Yes, because the buyer is protected by the title insurance policy even though he no longer owns the land.\nD. Yes, because the buyer was successfully sued by a donee and not by a bona fide purchaser for value.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The facts tell you that the property was in the buyer\u2019s possession when the donee obtained the quitclaim deed from him. The donee\u2019s suit against the buyer was based on the buyer\u2019s warranty of title in the deed to the investor. Because the donee is an heir of the buyer\u2019s estate, the donee\u2019s recovery against the buyer means that the buyer\u2019s warranty was breached. The title insurance policy that insured the buyer\u2019s deed to the investor also insures the buyer against title claims by heirs and assigns of that deed. Therefore, the buyer can recover damages from the title insurance company for the amount that he paid to the donee. A is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s conveyance to the investor did not terminate the seller\u2019s claim against the buyer. That claim terminated only when the investor or a subsequent grantee of the investor (who was not a bona fide purchaser) made a claim against the buyer. B is incorrect. The lapse of the policy would be relevant if it occurred after the donee\u2019s suit against the buyer. Because the policy was in effect when the buyer and the donee conveyed the land to the investor, it continues to protect the buyer even if it lapsed after that. D is incorrect. The buyer may have been sued by the donee, but the donee was not a bona fide purchaser for value. The donee\u2019s claim against the buyer arose out of the buyer\u2019s warranty to the investor, and the title insurance policy that insured the buyer\u2019s deed to the investor also insures the buyer against title claims by heirs and assigns of that deed.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

Finally, the niece paid the taxes to avoid a tax foreclosure sale. The niece then sued the husband for reimbursement for the two years\u2019 worth of property taxes. There is no applicable statute.

Subsequently, the woman executed a mortgage on the same four-acre lot to a finance company to secure repayment of a $50,000 loan. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. The woman recently defaulted on both loans. The bank promptly initiated foreclosure proceedings and sent proper notice to all necessary parties. The current fair market value of the four-acre lot is $250,000. The finance company has filed a timely motion in the foreclosure proceeding asking the court to require the bank to first foreclose on two of the four acres in the four-acre lot. The bank opposes this motion and insists that it has the right to subject the entire four-acre lot to the foreclosure sale. Will the court grant the finance company\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the bank holds a purchase-money mortgage.\nB. No, because the entire four-acre lot is subject to the bank\u2019s senior mortgage.\nC. Yes, because a pro rata foreclosure of the lot will not prejudice the rights of the bank.\nD.

The testator had had two children, a son and a daughter, but only the daughter survived the testator.

The personal representative of the seller\u2019s estate wants to distribute the proceeds of the real property sale. The seller\u2019s will was executed many years ago and was duly admitted to probate. Paragraph 5 of his will leaves all of the seller\u2019s real property to his son, and Paragraph 6 leaves the residue of the estate to the seller\u2019s daughter.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. This is a reading comprehension question. The seller\u2019s will leaves all of his real property to his son and the residue of the estate to the daughter. The son and the daughter both have vested remainders subject to open. The son\u2019s interest will not vest until the death of the daughter. If the daughter dies before the son, her interest will terminate by reason of her death and the entire estate will pass in accordance with the provisions of the will. If, however, the son dies before the daughter, his interest will not terminate by reason of his death and he will take the real property by reason of his vested remainder. In this case, the son\u2019s interest will terminate only by reason of the daughter\u2019s death. Because the sale proceeds are a part of the real property, they will be included in the son\u2019s estate when he dies.

In an advertisement promoting sales of a particular drug, a drug company claimed that the drug was safe for children. Suit was filed against the company on behalf of a child who allegedly was harmed as a result of taking the drug. At the time the child took the drug, the available medical studies supported the company\u2019s claim that the drug was safe for children, but later research proved that the drug actually was harmful to children. The company has moved to dismiss the suit on First Amendment grounds. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because false or misleading commercial speech is not constitutionally protected.\nB. No, because the drug business is subject to extensive health and safety regulation.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The drug business is subject to extensive health and safety regulation, and false or misleading commercial speech is not constitutionally protected.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

On the first day the home was offered for sale, the homeowner gave a buyer a personal tour. The homeowner made no statements at all regarding the water damage or the roof. Without discovering the water damage or the leaking roof and without consulting a lawyer, the buyer immediately agreed in writing to buy the home for $200,000.

If the homeowner sues the buyer for breach of contract, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because no contract was formed since the buyer did not have a real opportunity to understand the essential terms\nof the contract.\nB. No, because the homeowner concealed evidence of the water damage and of the leaking roof.\nC.

B is incorrect because a party's nondisclosure of facts that prevent the other party from making an informed decision is not concealment of evidence.

The bakery did all of its weekly bread baking on Tuesdays. On Monday morning of the first week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 8,000 pounds of flour to the bakery, and the bakery accepted it on the wholesaler\u2019s assurance that the remaining 2,000 pounds would be delivered later that evening, which it was. The bakery paid for both deliveries on Wednesday. On Monday of the second week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5,000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5,000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender. Was the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the bakery was legally entitled to reject any tender that did not conform perfectly to the contract.\nB. Yes, because the tender was a substantial impairment of that installment and could not be cured.\nC. No, because the tender was not a substantial impairment of the entire contract, and the wholesaler had given assurance\nof a cure.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under the UCC, a contract for the sale of goods that requires the seller to provide a certain quantity of goods in a certain time period is either a contract for a series of separate goods or a single goods contract. If the contract is a series of separate goods, each installment must be either accepted or rejected as a whole. If the contract is a single goods contract, acceptance of one installment will be construed as an acceptance of all installments unless the rejecting party gives notice of rejection of a particular installment within a reasonable time after delivery of that installment. In either case, however, the buyer is free to accept or reject any installment that is non-conforming. When the bakery rejected the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour, it was rejecting an installment that was non-conforming to the contract in that it was a substantial impairment of that installment. The bakery, however, did not give notice of rejection of the installment within a reasonable time after delivery, and therefore it was legally justified in rejecting that installment only if it also rejected the entire contract. Because the bakery accepted the first 8,000 pounds of flour on Monday of the first week, it was not free to reject the second installment because by accepting the first installment, it had waived the condition of perfect tender and had not reinstated it. A is incorrect because the UCC does not give the buyer the right to reject a installment that is non-conforming if the buyer accepts the installment. C is incorrect because the bakery was not justified in rejecting the tender because the wholesaler had given assurance of a cure. When the bakery accepted the first 8,000 pounds of flour on Monday of the first week, it waived the condition of perfect tender and had not reinstated it.

When the rancher refused to harvest the crop, he breached the contract, and the neighbor was entitled to damages for the loss of his crop. Although normally damages for breach of contract are limited to the reasonable value of the loss, here, because the neighbor was unable to use the crop as security for a loan, the lost opportunity to use the crop as security caused the neighbor to sustain consequential damages in the amount of $1,000.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA niece had worked in her aunt\u2019s bookstore for many years. The bookstore business, which was housed in a building that the aunt leased, was independently appraised at $200,000. The aunt decided to retire. She wrote to the niece, expressing her affection for the niece and offering to sell her the bookstore business for $125,000 if the landlord would agree to a transfer of the lease. The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt\u2019s offer. In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms. Before the attorney had finished drafting the document, the aunt changed her mind about selling the business and informed the niece of her decision. In an action for breach of contract brought by the niece against her aunt, is the niece likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the motivation for the transfer of the business was the aunt\u2019s affection for her niece, not the price.\nB. No, because the promised consideration was inadequate in light of the market value of the business.\nC. Yes, because the condition concerning the landlord\u2019s assent to the transfer of the lease was beyond the control of\neither party.\nD. Yes, because the document being drafted by the attorney was merely a record of an agreement already made, not a\ncondition to it.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under the UCC, a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is a writing indicating the contract that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. In this case, such a writing was never executed, and therefore, the niece and the aunt did not have a valid contract. A is incorrect because the adequacy of the price is irrelevant if the goods being sold are of a type that can be identified by their characteristics rather than by their brand or other distinctive designation. The bookstore business is one of a type that can be identified by its characteristics rather than by brand or other distinctive designation. Therefore, the $125,000 price was sufficient to identify the goods being sold. C is incorrect because even if the condition had been met, the absence of a writing would still have rendered the agreement void.

Because he was eager for work, the actor agreed, in the contract, to pay the agent 15% of his yearly earnings. At the end of the year, the actor was so pleased with his many roles that he gave the agent 20% of his earnings. After the first contract had expired, the actor and the agent decided to continue working together. They photocopied their old contract, changed the date, and signed it. At the end of the year, a dispute arose as to what percentage of earnings the actor owed. It is a trade practice in the acting profession for actors to pay their agents 10% of their yearly earnings, payable at the end of the year. What percentage of the actor\u2019s earnings is a court most likely to award the agent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 20%, because course of dealing is given greater weight than trade usage.\nB. 15%, because it was an express term of the contract.\nC. 10%, because trade usage is the applicable default rule.\nD.

The acknowledgment repeated the terms of the buyer\u2019s offer and stated that shipment would occur within five days. Among 12 printed terms on the acknowledgment was a statement that any dispute about the cotton\u2019s quality would be submitted to arbitration.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

In the writing, the supplier agreed to fulfill those requirements and to give the company a 10% discount off its published prices, but it reserved the right to increase the published prices during the year. After the parties had performed under the agreement for three months, the supplier notified the company that it would no longer give the company the 10% discount off the published prices. Does the company have a viable claim against the supplier for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because part performance of the agreement by both parties made it enforceable for the full year.\nB. Yes, because the company\u2019s agreement to buy all of its lawn care products from the supplier made the agreement\nenforceable.\nC.

Because the supplier\u2019s agreement with the company stated that the supplier had the right to increase the published prices during the year, the offer was an illusory offer that the supplier could, and did, revoke at any time. A is incorrect because even if the offer had been enforceable for the full year, the supplier could have revised its published prices at any time during the year and was not required to continue to give the company the 10% discount off the published prices.

The contract provided that delivery of the steel joists would begin on September 1. Although the general contractor had no reason to doubt the subcontractor\u2019s ability to perform, the general contractor wanted to be sure that the subcontractor was on track for delivery in September. He therefore wrote a letter on July 1 to the subcontractor demanding that the subcontractor provide assurance of its ability to meet the September 1 deadline. The subcontractor refused to provide such assurance. The general contractor then immediately obtained the steel joists from another supplier. If the subcontractor sues the general contractor for breach of contract, is the subcontractor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the subcontractor anticipatorily repudiated the contract when it failed to provide adequate assurance.\nB. No, because the contract failed to specify a definite quantity.\nC. Yes, because a demand for assurance constitutes a breach of contract when the contract does not expressly authorize a\nparty to demand assurance.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. When a contract fails to specify a definite quantity, the parties are generally free to perform in installments or to specify a reasonable time for completion of the whole contract. When the contract fails to specify a definite quantity and the parties do not agree otherwise, the risk of loss of any installment passes to the party who is in possession of the goods at the time of the installment. Because the contract between the general contractor and the subcontractor failed to specify a definite quantity, the risk of loss of the steel joists passed to the general contractor on July 1 when the subcontractor failed to provide assurance of its ability to perform. When a party anticipatorily repudiates a contract, the non-repudiating party may either treat the repudiation as a breach and recover damages or accept the repudiation and recover damages for total breach. Because the subcontractor\u2019s failure to provide assurance was not a repudiation, the general contractor may not treat the failure as a repudiation and instead must recover damages for total breach.

Yes, because a court will imply a term imposing on the buyer a duty to use reasonable efforts to secure bank\nfinancing.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, parties can contract for an obligation that is conditioned upon the occurrence of a subsequent event. However, the event must be outside of the control of the party who is under a duty to perform. The duty to secure bank financing is a condition within the meaning of the contract. But because the bank financing was not secured, the seller is not entitled to enforce the contract. A court will not imply a duty to secure bank financing because the duty to secure bank financing is not within the control of the buyer. The seller could have structured the contract so that the duty to secure bank financing would be expressly imposed on the buyer, but because the duty is not within the control of the buyer, the seller cannot enforce it. A is incorrect. The fact that the buyer did not secure bank financing is not a basis for the seller\u2019s claim against the buyer for breach of contract. The buyer\u2019s failure to secure bank financing is not a valid basis for enforcement of the contract. C is incorrect. The doctrine of constructive conditions does not apply when one of the parties has a duty to perform an event that is outside of that party\u2019s control. D is incorrect.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. A contract may be avoided on grounds of duress if the elements of duress are established: (i) existence of a threat of force or violence against a person; (ii) a causal connection between the threat and the making of the contract; and (iii) surrender of freedom of action by the party allegedly under duress. The threat of withholding visitation rights is a threat of force or violence against a person, and the mother's sale of the property is a surrender of her freedom of action in selling the property. Therefore, the contract may be avoided on grounds of duress. B is incorrect because inadequate consideration is not a basis for avoiding the contract.

On January 10, the lender telephoned the borrower and said that he would discharge the debt if the borrower would promise to pay the lender $45,000 by January 15. The borrower responded, \u201cI will attempt to get the money together.\u201d On January 11, the lender again telephoned the borrower and said that he had changed his mind and would expect the borrower to make full payment on March 1. On January 15, the borrower tendered $45,000 as full payment, which the lender refused to accept. On March 1, the borrower refused the lender\u2019s demand for $50,000, and the lender sued for that amount. Which of the following statements best supports the lender\u2019s position?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The borrower\u2019s January 10 statement was not a return promise, and therefore the lender effectively revoked his offer\non January 11.\nB. The January 10 telephone conversation between the lender and the borrower created an executory accord and therefore\ndid not operate as a discharge of the $50,000 debt.\nC. The lender\u2019s offer to discharge the debt was a gift promise and therefore was not binding on the lender.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under the UCC, an offer to discharge a debt can operate as a gift promise or an executory accord. If the offer is accepted as a gift promise, the debt is discharged and there is no further obligation for either party. If the offer is accepted as an executory accord, however, the debt is not discharged, but rather the parties have agreed to a modified form of contract. In this case, the lender\u2019s offer to discharge the $50,000 debt was an executory accord, not a gift promise. Therefore, when the borrower tendered $45,000 on January 15, the lender was not obligated to accept it, and his refusal to do so was not a breach of contract. A is incorrect because the lender\u2019s offer to discharge the debt was not a return promise.

No, because good character cannot be proved by specific instances of conduct unless character is an essential element\nof the charge or defense.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. When a criminal defendant is charged with a crime that involves dishonesty, evidence of his good character for honesty is not admissible to prove his guilt. However, in a prosecution for fraud, the government is not required to prove the defendant\u2019s bad character for honesty; rather, the government must prove that the defendant \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d committed the fraudulent act. In addition, the defendant is permitted to offer evidence of his good character for honesty to prove that he did not knowingly and willfully commit the fraudulent act charged. The testimony about the large sums of money the corporation had entrusted to the defendant on previous occasions is admissible to prove that the defendant did not knowingly and willfully commit the fraudulent act charged, and is therefore relevant to the defense the defendant is raising. A is incorrect because the testimony is not extrinsic evidence on a collateral matter. Although testimony about specific instances of conduct can be used to prove character if the trait is essential to the charge or defense, in this case the testimony is admissible because the defendant is the one asserting that he did not knowingly and willfully commit the fraudulent act charged. B is incorrect because the testimony is not barred by the rule excluding evidence of good character. C is incorrect because the testimony is not evidence of a pertinent trait offered by the accused.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

Why is the cyclist\u2019s testimony relating what the defendant\u2019s employee said at the hospital admissible to prove negligence?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It is a prior inconsistent statement.\nB.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The employee\u2019s statement at the hospital is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted \u2013 that the employee was not negligent. Thus, it is hearsay. However, the statement is admissible under the statement against interest exception to the hearsay rule. The statement was a confession by a party-opponent\u2019s agent and was made without any consideration. A is incorrect because the statement is not a prior inconsistent statement. Although the employee\u2019s testimony at trial is inconsistent with his statement at the hospital, the employee\u2019s testimony at trial is not a prior inconsistent statement because it is consistent with his statement at the hospital. C is incorrect because the statement is not a statement by a party-opponent\u2019s agent. Although the statement was made by an agent of the defendant, it was made in connection with an effort to get information about the cyclist\u2019s condition and was not made to obtain release of any claim. D is incorrect because the statement is not a statement of then-existing state of mind.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The executive went home, but she returned that night to retrieve personal items from her office. When she discovered that her key no longer opened a door to the building, she forced the door open and went to her former office. To avoid attracting attention, she did not turn on any lights. In the dark, she knew that she was taking some items that were not hers; she planned to sort these out later and return them. Upon arriving home, she found that she had taken a record book and some financial papers that belonged to the firm. After thinking it over and becoming angrier over being fired, she burned the book and papers in her fireplace. The jurisdiction has expanded the crime of burglary to include all buildings. What crime(s) has the executive committed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Burglary and larceny.\nB. Burglary, but not larceny.\nC. Larceny, but not burglary.\nD.

Larceny is the taking of the property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it.

Burglary is the breaking and entering of a structure with the intent to commit a felony (in this case, larceny).

At trial, an expert witness testified for the defense that the defendant, an athlete, was under the influence of a performance-enhancing drug at the time he committed the battery and that he would not have done so had he not been so influenced. The defendant asked for an instruction to the effect that if the jury believed that he was influenced by the drug at the time of the crime and would not have committed it otherwise, it had to acquit him.

Evidence that the defendant is addicted to this drug and has an overwhelming urge to consume it.\nB. Evidence that the defendant\u2019s coach, who gave him the drug, told him it was only an aspirin.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct.

An agent decided to enter the man\u2019s house while he was not at home and see what he could find. The agent discovered an envelope containing $5,000 in cash and an executive\u2019s business card. Returning the envelope to its place, the agent located and interviewed the executive, who admitted that he had paid the man $5,000 to settle a gambling debt; the executive also disclosed that the man regularly took illegal bets from the executive and several of his acquaintances. The agent then interviewed the acquaintances, who confirmed what the executive had told him. The agent then arranged to be introduced to the man at a local bar. After a few drinks, the man, unaware of the agent\u2019s identity, boasted that he was one of the biggest bookmakers in the state. The agent testified to all of his investigation\u2019s discoveries before a grand jury, which returned an indictment against the man for illegal gambling activities, based solely on the agent\u2019s testimony. The man\u2019s attorney then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it rested on violations of the man\u2019s constitutional rights. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because dismissal of the indictment is not the appropriate remedy.\nB. Yes, because much of the agent\u2019s testimony before the grand jury was inadmissible hearsay.\nC. Yes, because of the agent\u2019s unlawful search of the man\u2019s home.\nD. Yes, because of the agent\u2019s violation of the man\u2019s right to counsel.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. An indictment is only a means to guarantee that a grand jury is presented with a true bill, and that the prosecution has done its preliminary work to ensure that the charges are warranted by the evidence. An indictment is not proof of guilt, and a court will not dismiss an otherwise valid indictment simply because it believes the evidence against the defendant is weak. A court might, however, dismiss an indictment if it determines that the prosecution has violated the defendant\u2019s rights in a way that has prejudiced the defense, in which case the remedy is not dismissal of the indictment but rather dismissal of the charges. Here, the man\u2019s motion to dismiss should be granted because the agent\u2019s violation of the man\u2019s right to counsel has prejudiced the defense to such an extent that a fair trial cannot proceed. The agent\u2019s testimony before the grand jury was inadmissible hearsay (Answer B is incorrect because testimony before a grand jury is not hearsay), but that is not a sufficient reason on its own to grant the motion to dismiss the indictment. Because the agent\u2019s testimony is inadmissible, the grand jury should have been given the opportunity to hear the testimony of the executive and the acquaintances, but Answer B is incorrect because testimony before a grand jury does not have to be given by the original declarant.

Alibi is a matter of defense and so must be established by the defendant; however, the burden of persuasion is by a\npreponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.\nB. Before you may consider the defendant\u2019s claim of alibi, you must decide whether he has produced sufficient evidence\nto raise the issue.\nC. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was present at the convenience store at about 11 p.m. on\nMarch 5, you must find him not guilty.\nD. If the defendant\u2019s evidence has caused you to have a reasonable doubt as to whether he was the robber, you must find\nhim not guilty.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The court should instruct the jury that if the evidence has caused the jury to have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant is guilty, they must find him not guilty. The jury, as fact-finder, can acquit even if it has a reasonable doubt about the prosecution's proof of guilt.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA state statute provides: \u201cAggravated robbery of the elderly consists of robbery committed against a victim who is 65 years of age or older.\u201d Another state statute provides that when a criminal statute does not designate a necessary mental state, the mental state required is recklessness. A third state statute provides that a person acts recklessly if the person \u201cconsciously disregards a substantial and unjustified risk that the material element exists or will result from the person\u2019s conduct.\u201d The evidence at a criminal trial showed that the defendant robbed a 66-year-old man outside a senior citizens\u2019 center. The defendant testified truthfully that the robbery had occurred on a dark night, that she had had no idea how old the victim was and had not cared how old the victim was, and that she had intended to rob whomever she encountered. Could the defendant properly be convicted of aggravated robbery of the elderly?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the only evidence on the issue showed that the defendant did not know, nor could she reasonably have\nknown, the victim\u2019s age.\nB. No, because there was no evidence of a substantial risk that the victim was age 65 or older.\nC. Yes, because the evidence was clear that the victim was 66 years old, and the statute is designed to protect the elderly.\nD.

Upon arriving at the house, the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious. An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine. After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana. The young woman has filed a motion to suppress the use of both as evidence on the ground that the entry into the house and the searches were made without a warrant.
