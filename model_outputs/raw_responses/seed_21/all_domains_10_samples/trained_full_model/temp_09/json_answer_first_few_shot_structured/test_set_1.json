            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction.

Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Although a request for waiver of service was sent, the defendant was not obligated to and did not respond to the request. Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck.

To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery. However, the woman\u2019s goal is to dismiss and refile the action. Submitting the described affidavit would not achieve that goal.",

The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), holds that Congress does not have the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate a noncommercial activity with no link to interstate commerce. Unlike in Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), the facts here do not involve a comprehensive regulation of commerce that incidentally covers some intrastate activities. Answer A is incorrect. Congress can use its commerce power to regulate economic activity, such as manufacturing and production of articles for interstate commerce, that is not itself a commercial transaction. In addition, Gonzales v. Raich holds that Congress can incidentally regulate noncommercial activities in order to effectuate regulations of related commercial activities. Answer C is incorrect. While stoves and fuels may have previously moved in interstate commerce, they are not themselves channels or instrumentalities of commerce. Answer D is incorrect. United States v. Lopez holds that the aggregate effects test applies only to regulations of economic activity.",

The President appointed a director, and the Senate confirmed the appointment.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect. It states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not applicable in this case. The state sterilization requirement would receive strict judicial scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation.",

On numerous occasions, the wife\u2019s brother had offered to buy the farm from her, but she had always refused. The husband died suddenly in an accident. The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

Even though the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, the nephew\u2019s consent was not required for modification unless the contract provided otherwise. Here, however, there was no modification of the contract, because the daughter did not agree to it. Answer C is incorrect. The father retained no interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise, and thus he could not alter her obligation without her consent. Answer D is incorrect. There was no effective modification, because the daughter did not agree to it. Furthermore, the general common law rule is that a modification requires consideration, and here there was no consideration from the father.",

The owner had no further contact with the purchasers and, in fact, did not know who owned many of the lots. In 2000, the owner decided to sell the remaining 75 lots in a single bulk sale to a developer. The owner advertised the properties for sale with the stipulation that they must be used for single family purposes only.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

Because the tree specialist was hired by the landowner and cut down the trees at the direction of the landowner, the landowner (along with the tree specialist) is subject to liability for conversion.",

Answer B is incorrect. The passenger\u2019s negligence is relevant to the damages awarded, if any, but it is not a bar to a res ipsa instruction. Answer D is incorrect. The question of the passenger\u2019s negligence is not relevant to whether a res ipsa instruction is appropriate but rather to the amount of damages to assess if the company is found liable.",

On the day he arrived, just after sunset, he took his bag upstairs to a second-floor bedroom and unpacked. As he was about to head back downstairs, he realized that the stairwell had become too dark to navigate without a light. The man spent about 30 seconds feeling the walls at the top of the stairwell but could not find a light switch.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

The mortgage provided that the debt would be paid in full on January 1, 2015, and that the mortgage would then be void. On that date, the debt was in fact fully paid, but the owner and the lender did not record the satisfaction of the mortgage. Instead, the owner and the lender each assumed the other would fulfill the requirements of the mortgage. On January 2, 2015, the owner sold and conveyed the tract to a buyer \"subject to the mortgage.\" The sale was recorded on January 6, 2015. On January 7, 2015, the lender foreclosed on the mortgage and sold the tract at an online auction to a third party for $200,000. The owner and the lender both received notices of the foreclosure sale, but neither made an appearance at the sale. The third party purchased the tract",

            "question_number": 99,
            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The witness\u2019s testimony is sufficient to authenticate the photograph under FRE 901.

For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The defense attorney should have immediately objected when the witness related inadmissible hearsay. An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103. In addition, the delayed objection failed to preserve the right to appeal, because the defense attorney did not state a specific basis for the objection under FRE 103. Answer A is incorrect. Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103. Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect. An objection must be made at the earliest opportunity under FRE 103, and an objection that is made \u201cduring trial\u201d but not while the witness is still on the stand is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The defense may offer extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for the limited non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness after the witness has been given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Answer A is incorrect. The witness\u2019s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose. And since there is no applicable hearsay exception for the witness\u2019s statement to the investigator, it cannot be admitted to prove that the plaintiff did not fall.",

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect. Because the newspaper story is not offered for its truth, but rather to demonstrate notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy, it is not hearsay, and no hearsay exception is required for its admission. Further, the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule applies to testimony from a witness who made or adopted the recorded recollection, which is not the case here.",

The woman\u2019s death did not affect the nephew\u2019s springing executory interest, and her estate now holds the fee simple subject to executory limitation.

The fact that the nephew recorded the deed provided constructive notice to the world of his interest but did not affect his interest. The nephew received a springing executory interest and the woman held a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Answer C is incorrect. The nephew received a future interest that will vest when he marries. The woman\u2019s death did not invalidate the nephew\u2019s springing executory interest. Answer D is incorrect.

The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Last year, the woman died intestate, leaving a son as her only heir. The son sued the city, claiming ownership of the land, but the court found against him. What is the most likely explanation for the court\u2019s decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The city acquired the land by adverse possession.\nB. The son\u2019s interest ended as a result of the changing needs of the city.\nC. The son\u2019s interest lapsed on the death of the woman.\nD.

The tribunal's duties were to review claims made by veterans and to make recommendations to the Veterans Administration on their merits. Congress later abolished the tribunal and established a different format for review of such claims. The woman was offered a federal administrative position in the same bureau at a lower salary. She thereupon sued the government on the ground that Congress may not remove a federal judge from office during good behavior nor reduce her compensation during her continuance in office. Government attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the action. The court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. deny the motion because of the independence of the federal judiciary constitutionally guaranteed by Article III.\nB. deny the motion because of the woman's property right to her federal employment on the tribunal.\nC. grant the motion because the woman lacked standing to raise the question.\nD. grant the motion because the woman was not a judge under Article III and is not entitled to life tenure.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n{\n        \"domain\": \"Constitutional_law\",\n        \"chosen_option_label\": \"A\",\n        \"explanation\": {\n            \"Legal",

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds.

In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

So let's make it a double date, and I'll invite someone else to join us.\" The woman accepted the offer. The man then called a mutual acquaintance and asked him to join the woman and him on the cruise. The acquaintance accepted. The man and the woman had not told the acquaintance about the other's presence. The cruise ship sailed from a U.S. port bound for an Asian port of call. The woman and the man had a stateroom, and the acquaintance and the man had a second stateroom. On the first night of the cruise, the woman and the man had too much to drink. The man took the key to his stateroom and went with the woman into her stateroom. They shut the door.

Answer A is incorrect because the facts do not show that the man took sufficient steps toward completing a murder.

The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony.

The woman owned a small car, which she kept in a garage at her house. The woman told the man to follow her as she drove to the garage, took a key from her pocket, unlocked the door to the garage, and drove into the garage. Once inside the garage, the woman locked the door behind her. The man entered the garage and the woman pointed out her car. The woman offered to show the man the car's features, but he declined.

On these facts, a jury could rationally find both that the woman was guilty of reckless driving and that her illegal conduct caused the truck driver\u2019s death. The woman\u2019s conduct constitutes involuntary manslaughter under a theory of \u201cmisdemeanor-manslaughter.\u201d Answer A is incorrect. The woman could be guilty of murder on a theory of malice aforethought only if she intended to kill the driver. But the facts do not remotely suggest that the woman had that intent. The facts also do not support any theory of imputed malice, such as felony murder or depraved indifference. Answer B is incorrect because the woman did not intend to kill the driver and thus cannot be guilty of voluntary manslaughter.

            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
