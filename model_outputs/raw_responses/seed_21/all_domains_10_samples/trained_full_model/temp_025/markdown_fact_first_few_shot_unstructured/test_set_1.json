The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

Where the company\u2019s major place of manufacturing is located.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. For diversity purposes, a corporation is a resident of the state where it is incorporated and where it has its principal place of business. A shareholder of a corporation brings a suit against the corporation in federal court. The shareholder\u2019s attorney needs to determine whether the parties are diverse. The shareholder is a resident of State A and the corporation is a resident of State B. The corporation has its principal place of business in State B. The shareholder\u2019s attorney can determine that the parties are diverse if they can show that the shareholder is a resident of State A and the corporation is a resident of State B. If the shareholder\u2019s attorney can show that the corporation has its principal place of business in State A, then the parties would not be diverse and the case would be dismissed. D is the correct choice because it specifies the location of the corporation\u2019s principal place of business. A is incorrect because it does not specify the location of the corporation\u2019s principal place of business.

            "question_number": 1,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The complaint set out the bank\u2019s method of calculating interest and alleged that the method violated both federal banking law and state contract law. The bank filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that its method of calculating interest, as described in the complaint, was proper under federal law and that the federal law preempted the depositor\u2019s state-law claim. The court granted the motion to dismiss the depositor\u2019s federal claim and reserved ruling on the motion to dismiss the state-law claim. After completing discovery, the bank has moved to dismiss the state-law claim for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court may hear the state-law claim, because it is so related to the federal claim that they form part of the same case or controversy.\nB. The court must hear the state-law claim, because it is so related to the federal claim that they form part of the same case or controversy.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The federal and state claims predominate when the federal claim is a substantial part of the proceeding and the state claim is a claim that arises out of the same facts. Here, the federal claim is a substantial part of the proceeding because it involves a motion to dismiss. The state claim arises out of the same facts as the federal claim because it involves the method of calculating interest. These facts indicate that the state and federal claims predominate over one another and that the claims may form part of the same case or controversy. B is correct. When a party files a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the burden is on the party asserting jurisdiction to prove it exists. Here, the bank has moved to dismiss the state claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because the burden is on the bank to prove that there is no subject matter jurisdiction, the court must hear the state claim. D is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

The complaint asserted a $120,000 claim under state law. Fifty days after service of the complaint, the plaintiff amended the complaint, adding a second defendant, a citizen of State C. The amended complaint asserted the $120,000 state-law claim and a related federal-law claim against both defendants. Twenty-five days after service of the amended complaint, the second defendant removed the action to a federal court in State B with the first defendant\u2019s consent. Was removal proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the first defendant was a citizen of the forum state.\nB. No, because the notice of removal was untimely.\nC.

C is incorrect because the amended complaint did not add a federal claim. D is incorrect because the parties must meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction by the time the case is removed.

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

The defendant travels to State A once each year for a weeklong vacation but has no other State A contacts. The defendant answered, denying all allegations. One week later, the defendant filed an amended answer, denying all allegations and including the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. State A has a long-arm statute that permits personal jurisdiction to the constitutional limit. The defendant has moved for an order dismissing the action based on the personal-jurisdiction challenge asserted in the amended answer. Should the court issue the order?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant waived the challenge to personal jurisdiction by failing to include it in her original answer.\nB. No, because the defendant was personally served with process within 100 miles of the federal courthouse where the action is pending.\nC.

Choice of venue is generally within the discretion of the transferor court, and the convenience of the witnesses is just one factor to consider.

The convenience of the parties and the judicial economy of having related cases in the same court are important factors to consider when determining whether to transfer a case. Here, the convenience of the parties is neutral because the passenger is from State A and the railroad is from State B.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

After several members were arrested, the organization\u2019s leader called for \u201ceven bigger demonstrations next week to halt operations at the base.\u201d The US Attorney in the jurisdiction brought a federal civil action against the organization and its leader, seeking an injunction against protests that interfered with the base\u2019s operations. With the complaint, the US Attorney moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to \u201cenjoin any blockade of the base\u2019s entrance or other disruption of base activity until the court can hear motions for a preliminary and a permanent injunction.\u201d The US Attorney attached an affidavit certifying the unsuccessful efforts she had made to locate the organization and its leader and to notify them of the motion. The court immediately held a hearing and issued the TRO in a one-sentence order that did not describe the acts to be restrained but instead incorporated by reference the allegations of the complaint and the TRO motion. Did the court properly grant the TRO?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the order did not describe in reasonable detail the acts to be restrained.\nB.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The competitor will not be prejudiced by the addition of the competitor as a defendant because the competitor has been aware of the action from the beginning and has had the opportunity to prepare a defense. B is incorrect. The amendment of the complaint to add the competitor as a defendant would likely be futile because the worker has not presented evidence that supports the claim that the competitor defamed her. C is correct. Federal Rule 15 allows a party to amend its pleading without the opposing party\u2019s permission as a matter of course if the party files its pleading within a reasonable time. Here, the worker filed her original complaint within a reasonable time, so she is entitled to amend her pleading without the competitor\u2019s permission. D is correct. The worker can add the competitor as a defendant to her action without affecting the time for the competitor to answer the complaint if the amendment relates back to the time when the original complaint was filed.

Relation back does not apply here because the worker\u2019s failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party. Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The friend, like the driver, was a mere licensee on the store\u2019s premises. A licensee is entitled to be on the land for the purpose of using the land, but is not privileged or invited to do so. A licensee is charged with the duty to use the land with reasonable care for the safety of others. If a licensee does not use the land with reasonable care for the safety of others, the landowner is not liable for any injury the licensee may suffer. Here, the friend was a licensee of the store\u2019s premises. He was not invited to be there, and he did not use the truck with reasonable care for the safety of others. The store\u2019s shipping manager was also a licensee. He was not invited to be there, and he did not use the truck with reasonable care for the safety of others. The court should enter summary judgment in favor of the store because the friend was a licensee who did not use the truck with reasonable care for the safety of others. B is incorrect. The court should not deny both motions because it should consider each motion on its own merits. C is incorrect. The court should not grant the store\u2019s motion because assumption of the risk is not a complete defense. It is a defense that reduces the time period during which the defendant may be found to have been negligent. It is not a defense that defeats the claim altogether. D is incorrect. The court should not grant the store\u2019s motion because the friend would not have to prove that he was less at fault than the manager.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

Is the writ valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because only federal courts can issue habeas writs for individuals in federal custody.\nB. No, because the arrest was made pursuant to a warrant.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The federal habeas statute specifically permits state courts to issue the writ in certain circumstances. B is incorrect. The arrest of the governor by federal agents pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by a federal judge triggers the running of the federal statute of limitations on habeas corpus claims. Here, the governor has already been in custody for seven days, so any claim he has under federal law is time-barred. C is incorrect. The anti-commandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment protects the states, not their governors, from federal interference. D is correct. The Constitution establishes a strong national preference for resolving cases on their merits at the earliest possible opportunity. By not promptly resolving cases on their merits, the federal government would violate this preference. Here, the federal government has the governor in custody pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by a federal judge. The director of the lockup facility should move the federal court to dismiss the habeas petition, or, if the petition is filed by a non-prisoner, move the state court to transfer the case to the federal court.

A construction company submitted a bid that was lowest in cost, but the agency chose another bidder that offered more advantages on the other factors. The company that submitted the lowest bid sued the federal agency in federal district court. The only relief that the company sought was to enjoin the issuance of a contract to the prevailing bidder.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. By not obtaining a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, the company waived any claim for such relief. A party seeking such relief must move for it promptly, or risk waiving the claim. Here, the company failed to obtain such relief promptly, so it waived its claim for it. Mootness is a defense that defeats a claim not only when it is raised by the opposing party, but also when it is raised by the court on its own motion.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The tea, which can cause death and paralysis, is a controlled substance under federal law. The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates the manufacture, distribution, and possession of controlled substances. The CSA provides that it is a federal offense to knowingly or intentionally manufacture, distribute, or possess a controlled substance. The CSA also provides that it is a federal offense to conspire to manufacture, distribute, or possess a controlled substance. The CSA further provides that it is a federal offense for any person to distribute or possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance in a school zone. A school zone is defined as any area within a radius of 1,000 feet from the grounds of any public, private, or parochial school. The CSA specifies that it is intended to be a general prohibition of the manufacture, distribution, or possession of controlled substances, and that it is not intended to preempt any state law that is not in conflict with it. The CSA is a federal statute that regulates the manufacture, distribution, and possession of a controlled substance. The statute at issue is a state statute that makes possession of a controlled substance a misdemeanor. The state statute is a law that is not in conflict with the CSA, and thus is not preempted by the CSA. The state statute regulates the manufacture, distribution, and possession of a controlled substance, so it is within the scope of the CSA. Because the state statute is a law that is not in conflict with the CSA, and is within the scope of the CSA, it is not preempted by the CSA. A is incorrect because the CSA only regulates commercial transactions involving controlled substances. B is incorrect because the state statute does not require any nexus to interstate commerce.

Because a majority of senators favor strict drug-law enforcement, the Senate has refused to consent to the director\u2019s removal. May the President constitutionally remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director\u2019s appointment and removal.\nB. No, because the President\u2019s removal of principal officers of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\nC. Yes, because congressional participation in the decision to remove a presidential appointee violates the separation of powers.\nD. Yes, because Congress cannot limit the ability of the President to remove any employee of the executive branch.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The President has the power to remove at will any employee of the executive branch, including the director of the agency. However, when a presidential appointee is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, the President may only remove that individual with the Senate\u2019s consent. In this case, the director is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate because the statute authorizing the director\u2019s position requires the President to obtain the Senate\u2019s consent to remove the director. B is incorrect. The President\u2019s removal of a presidential appointee is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate only if the appointee is required to obtain the Senate\u2019s consent to take office. Here, the director does not have to obtain the Senate\u2019s consent to take office because the director is an executive branch employee. C is incorrect. The separation of powers doctrine does not apply to this fact pattern because it involves an individual removal, rather than a structural separation of powers issue. D is incorrect.

The state may require a carrier to register with the state and obtain a permit if the requirement: 1) is reasonably related to a legitimate state interest; 2) does not unduly burden interstate commerce; and 3) does not discriminate against interstate commerce. Here, the requirement that a carrier register with the state and obtain a permit is reasonably related to the legitimate state interest of ensuring the safety of the state\u2019s highways. The requirement does not unduly burden interstate commerce because it imposes only a minimal burden on commerce; requiring a carrier to register with the state and obtain a permit is substantially less burdensome than the much more extensive licensing and regulation of intrastate commerce. Finally, the requirement does not discriminate against interstate commerce because it applies to intrastate commerce as well as interstate commerce. A is incorrect because requiring a carrier to register with the state and obtain a permit is not necessary to facilitate the application of state laws to motor carriers. B is incorrect because requiring a carrier to register with the state and obtain a permit does not substantially burden interstate commerce.

The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The fact that the parties did not reach a final agreement does not mean that no contract was formed. A party may form a contract in one of two ways: (1) by making an offer and having the offer accepted; or (2) by performing in such a manner as to indicate an intention to be bound. In this case, the retailer formed a contract with the manufacturer when it sent its purchase order. The manufacturer formed a contract when it received the purchase order and shipped the laptops. Because the parties each formed a contract, they each have the burden of showing that any term in their respective contracts is invalid. B is incorrect. The fact that the acknowledgment form excluding consequential damages is a term that should be characterized as an additional term. An additional term is a proposal for addition to the contract. If a party makes an additional proposal, the other party may accept it. If the other party does not respond to the additional proposal within a reasonable time, the additional proposal is considered to be an additional agreement. In this case, the retailer did not accept the manufacturer\u2019s additional term excluding consequential damages. The additional term should be characterized as an additional agreement. If a party makes an additional proposal, the other party may accept it. If the other party does not respond to the additional proposal within a reasonable time, the additional proposal is considered to be an additional agreement. In this case, the retailer did not accept the manufacturer\u2019s additional term excluding consequential damages. The additional term should be characterized as an additional agreement. C is incorrect. The retailer\u2019s purchase order constituted an offer that was accepted by the manufacturer when it shipped the laptops.

In this case, the acknowledgment form was sent and received within a reasonable time, so the retailer\u2019s purchase order was accepted when the acknowledgment form was sent. D is correct.

If the offer is accepted with modification, the parties\u2019 agreement is formed on the terms specified in the offer to the extent that the offer is accepted without modification.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

The executive has sent a signed letter to the firm confirming the terms to which the parties have orally agreed while acknowledging that the salary has yet to be set. The firm has not responded to the confirmation letter. Do the parties now have an enforceable contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because an agreement for lifetime employment is subject to the statute of frauds, and the confirmation letter fails to satisfy the statute.\nB.

The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet.

The firm\u2019s bid included a subcontractor\u2019s bid to complete the electrical work on the plant for $100,000. The municipality awarded the construction contract to the firm. Later that day, before the firm told the subcontractor of the award, the subcontractor told the firm that it was withdrawing its bid because it had recently undertaken a new project that would absorb all its capacity for the next 18 months. The firm nevertheless accepted the subcontractor\u2019s bid and demanded that it perform the electrical work on the plant, but the subcontractor refused. The firm had to hire another subcontractor to perform the electrical work, at a cost of $115,000. The firm completed the construction of the plant at a profit. Which of the following statements correctly describes the firm\u2019s legal rights, if any, against the first subcontractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The firm is entitled to recover nominal damages only, because it completed the construction at a profit.\nB. The firm is entitled to recover reliance damages, because it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid when it submitted its own bid to the municipality.\nC. The firm is entitled to recover expectation damages, because the first subcontractor\u2019s bid was irrevocable for a reasonable time and the firm timely accepted it.\nD.

Reliance damages are available only in cases of misrepresentation or fraud. Here, there is no misrepresentation or fraud; the firm relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid, which was a promise to perform the work for a specified price. C is correct. The time period within which a bid remains valid depends on the circumstances of the case. In this case, the time period was probably a reasonable time, and the firm\u2019s failure to timely accept the bid may absolve the first subcontractor of liability. However, the firm may still recover expectation damages if it can prove that it detrimentally relied on the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

B is correct. By failing to insist on the strict performance of the contract, the owner anticipatorily repudiated the contract.

When one party makes an additional promise in response to an offer, that party is generally said to be making an additional proposal. If the other party accepts the additional proposal, the parties have a valid contract. In this case, the landlord\u2019s oral agreement to pay a discounted rate of $125 per hour for services in excess of 100 hours was an additional proposal. The company\u2019s acceptance of this proposal was its agreement to perform the required services for $125 per hour in the event that the services exceeded 100 hours. The parties thus had a valid contract for the performance of the required services at a discounted rate of $125 per hour. C is incorrect.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The father\u2019s directive to his daughter to pay $50,000 to the neighbor is a modification of the contract between the father and his daughter. The modification is effective without consideration, so the neighbor does not need to agree to it. B is incorrect. The nephew is a non-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter. A non-party beneficiary is entitled to enforce the contract, but only to the extent that the performance of the promise makes it possible for him to receive the benefit of the contract. Here, the performance of the promise (payment of $50,000 to the neighbor) makes it possible for the nephew to receive the benefit of the contract (the $300,000 payment from the daughter). Therefore, the nephew can enforce the contract to the extent that the performance of the promise makes it possible for him to receive the benefit of the contract. C is incorrect. The father\u2019s signed modification of the contract with his daughter created a new contract between the father and the neighbor. The creation of a new contract does not affect the existence of the original contract. The daughter is obligated to pay the $300,000 to the nephew pursuant to the original contract. D is correct. The father\u2019s signed modification of the contract with his daughter created a new contract between the father and the neighbor. The creation of a new contract does not affect the existence of the original contract. The daughter is obligated to pay the $300,000 to the nephew pursuant to the original contract.

Here, the daughter did not agree to the modification and the father provided no consideration. Answer B is incorrect. Even though the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, the nephew\u2019s consent was not required for modification unless the contract provided otherwise. Here, however, there was no modification of the contract, because the daughter did not agree to it. Answer C is incorrect. The father retained no interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise, and thus he could not alter her obligation without her consent. Answer D is incorrect. There was no effective modification, because the daughter did not agree to it.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The company will raise the defense of no duty because the situation involves a barefoot plaintiff.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB.

The former employee\u2019s actions constitute an improper interference with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts with purchasers.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA doctor ordered chest X-rays for a patient who smoked cigarettes. After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient\u2019s earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC. Yes, because punitive damages awards are not authorized unless there is proof of willful or wanton misconduct on the defendant\u2019s part.\nD. Yes, because the patient smoked cigarettes and therefore was contributorily negligent.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nPunitive damages are meant to punish the wrongdoer and to deter the wrongdoer and others from similar wrongdoing in the future. A jury's award of $21 million in punitive damages to a patient's estate for the negligent failure to detect cancer on X-rays is excessive and, therefore, will likely be reduced or even eliminated on appeal. The patient's estate is entitled to a multiple of the compensatory damages, usually between 1 and 4, for the punitive damages to be constitutional. In this case, the jury awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. The $21 million in punitive damages is a multiple of 7.5 times the compensatory damages. This multiple is too high and will likely be reduced on appeal.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

An employee of the agency went to the buyer\u2019s home and knocked on the front door. When the buyer answered, the employee explained that he was there to repossess the car and asked for the car keys. The buyer handed the employee the keys but then asked the employee to allow her to retrieve her laptop computer from the car. The employee declined the request, explaining to the buyer that any possessions in the car could be reclaimed from the company after the car was repossessed. After pleading unsuccessfully with the employee, the buyer shoved the employee away from the door with such force that the employee fell and suffered a broken wrist. The buyer then ran to the car, which was unlocked, and retrieved the laptop. The employee has sued the buyer for battery. The buyer has moved for summary judgment, arguing that she was privileged to act as she did. Should the trial court grant the buyer\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a fact-finder could reasonably conclude that the buyer used excessive force in attempting to defend her property.\nB. No, because after the buyer handed the keys to the employee, the car was no longer her property.\nC. Yes, because a possessor can use nonlethal force to protect his or her property.\nD.

As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

A conclusion that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous, combined with the fact that the woman experienced severe emotional distress and the fact that the debt collector was probably at least reckless with respect to the risk of causing her distress, will provide the woman with a plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman\u2019s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.   Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. Answer C is incorrect. A mere failure to comply with industry custom does not establish any of the elements of IIED.",

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

The friend was a mere licensee, so the homeowner's liability for the friend's injury is not limited to the conditions of the property over which the friend had control. The homeowner's failure to warn the friend of the danger of stepping on the loose boards made her liable for any injury the friend suffered from stepping on the boards. The contractor, on the other hand, was an invitee, so the owner's liability for the contractor's injury would have been limited to the condition of the property over which the contractor had control. The contractor was not an invitee, however, because the owner's loosening of the boards was done for the purpose of obtaining the contractor's professional services. The owner's actions were intentional and designed to deceive the contractor, so the contractor was a licensee. The owner's failure to warn the contractor of the danger of stepping on the loose boards made her liable for any injury the contractor suffered from stepping on the boards.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. A party may raise an objection at any time during the trial, provided that the party does so immediately after the occurrence of the act or circumstance of which the party complains.

Here, the statement is a statement of the mind (the woman\u2019s statement that the defendant was her supplier), it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the defendant sold cocaine), and it is not a statement of the current mental condition of the mind of the person making the statement (it is a statement of past events). Therefore, it is hearsay and does not fit any exception. A is incorrect because this statement does not fit any hearsay exception. C is incorrect because this statement does not fit the exception for statements of a coconspirator because it does not meet the burden of proof for that exception.

Answer A is incorrect. The witness\u2019s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect.

Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

Each conveyance was by a deed of gift containing a covenant specifying that only one single-story home could be constructed on the conveyed lot in order to preserve views of a nearby lake from the mother\u2019s lot. The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot.

The purchaser promptly recorded her deed. When the purchaser later began constructing a three-story house similar to the mother\u2019s, the mother sued to enjoin the construction. Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, since she herself constructed a three-story house.\nB.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The mother is not estopped to enforce the covenant because the estoppel doctrine only applies in cases involving representations, not in cases involving affirmative duties. Here, the mother\u2019s duty to abide by the covenant was purely negative\u2014she was prohibited from constructing a certain type of structure on her lot. The purchaser, on the other hand, had a duty to abide by the covenant to preserve the character of the neighborhood\u2014she was prohibited from constructing a three-story structure on her lot. In this case, the mother is not estopped to enforce the covenant because she is not making any representations to the purchaser. B is incorrect. Non-return gift deeds are generally void as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees for want of consideration. However, the deeds in this case are deeds of gift, so this defense will not apply. C is correct. The purchaser had no actual notice of the covenant, so the covenant was recorded. The burden of the covenant runs with the land, so the purchaser was charged with the knowledge of the covenant even though she had no actual notice. D is incorrect. Landowners are generally held to be in privity of contract with one another, but this is not the case in this fact pattern.

In this case, the nephew\u2019s title can be removed from the title by partition, because the nephew is a purchaser who has recorded his interest in the property. B is correct. The nephew\u2019s interest in the property is called a \u201cfuture interest.\u201d A future interest is a right or privilege in, or to, property that is subject to substantially all of the rules governing title to real property, except that it is a right or privilege that will not arise for an extended period of time. In this case, the nephew\u2019s interest is a future interest because it is a right or privilege in, or to, property that is subject to the rules governing title to real property. The nephew\u2019s interest is a future interest because it will not arise for an extended period of time, because it is a \u201cremainder\u201d interest, which arises only after the termination of the preceding interest.

A life estate is an interest in, or to, property that is subject to the rules governing title to real property and that is limited to the life of the grantee or another specified person.

Her friend agreed to loan her the entire purchase price if, immediately following the purchase, the woman would deed the land to him. They also agreed that the woman would have 10 years in which to repay the loan and that the friend would deed the land back to the woman when the loan was fully repaid. Lastly, they agreed that during the 10-year period the woman could live on the land. The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her. The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB. No, because the contract between the woman and her friend merged into the deed.\nC. Yes, because the parties agreed that the woman could live on the land.\nD.

The fact that the woman was given the privilege to live on the land means that the agreement was probably an agreement to purchase and sell the land. D is correct. An equitable mortgage arises where one person (the mortgagor) grants a right to another person (the mortgagee) to enter onto the mortgagor's land to remove a structure, if the mortgagor fails to pay a debt.

Five years later, the woman lost her job, had difficulty making her mortgage payments, and defaulted on several payments. The bank notified the woman that it would accelerate the mortgage debt as permitted by the mortgage. The woman tried to sell the house but could not find a buyer. The woman wants to avoid the publicity of a foreclosure sale and protect her credit rating. The house is not encumbered by any other liens.

Is the woman\u2019s proposal a viable foreclosure substitute under these facts?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because such a transaction would be a clog on the woman\u2019s equitable right of redemption.\nB. No, because this is residential property for which a foreclosure sale is required.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. A clog on one\u2019s equitable right of redemption occurs where a person who has defaulted on a mortgage makes an offer of payment to the mortgagee that is accepted by the mortgagee without objection. Here, the woman has not made an offer of payment to the bank. The bank is not obligated to accept any payment from the woman. Therefore, the woman\u2019s proposal to the bank would not create a clog on her equitable right of redemption. B is incorrect. A foreclosure sale is not required for residential property. A foreclosure sale is optional in an appropriate case. Here, the bank is not required to have a foreclosure sale. The woman may make a proposal to the bank at any time. C is correct. A voluntary conveyance of real property from a debtor to a creditor in full satisfaction of a claim is called a \u201csatisfaction of mortgage.\u201d When a mortgagee accepts a satisfaction of mortgage from a debtor, the mortgage is extinguished and the mortgagee takes the property subject to any unperfected interests in the property. In this case, the bank is willing to accept a satisfaction of mortgage from the woman. The bank would take the property subject to any unperfected interests, which in this case would be any other liens on the property. D is incorrect. A short sale is a sale of real property by a debtor to a buyer in satisfaction of a mortgage where the proceeds of the sale are less than the amount due on the mortgage.

Because the city needed additional parking for nearby city buildings, it paved the land and has used it as a parking lot ever since. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Last year, the woman died intestate, leaving a son as her only heir.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The court will find that the son\u2019s interest ended as a result of the changing needs of the city. The city\u2019s use of the land as a parking lot has been open and notorious for the past 17 years. That, combined with the fact that the city acquired the land for that purpose, will satisfy the necessary elements for acquiring title by adverse possession. A is incorrect because the city did not acquire the land by adverse possession. The time period for acquiring title by adverse possession is 10 years in this jurisdiction, not 20. The city\u2019s possession of the land has not been for a long enough period of time to meet that standard. C is incorrect because the woman\u2019s interest did not lapse. A lapse occurs when a title holder fails to assert his or her title, thus allowing another to claim the property. The woman never asserted her title to the land. The city, on the other hand, asserted its title to the land when it paved the land and has been using it for parking. D is incorrect because the woman retained her interest in the land.

The bank responded that it had the right to include both the commercial building and the motel in the foreclosure proceedings. Who is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. A mortgage is a security interest in real property that is created by a promissory note that is secured by a mortgage on the property. A mortgage on a residential property may be voluntarily created to secure a debt, but it is usually created to secure a debt that is originally contracted. In this case, the mother's mortgage was created to secure the bank's debt. The bank's debt was originally contracted when the man borrowed money from the bank to purchase the commercial property. The mother's mortgage was created to secure the bank's debt, so it is a junior lien. Junior liens are subject to the same statutory priority rules as senior liens. Under those rules, a junior lien is given priority over a senior lien if the junior lien was created to secure a debt that was originally contracted by the obligor. In this case, the mother's mortgage was created to secure a debt that was originally contracted by the obligor (the man). As a result, the bank's mortgage on the motel is entitled to priority over the mother's mortgage. A is incorrect because a mortgage may be created to secure a debt that is not originally contracted. In this case, the mother's mortgage is a junior lien that is entitled to priority over the bank's mortgage. C is incorrect because non-payment of the debt secured by a mortgage is sufficient cause for the foreclosure of the mortgage. Failure to note the mortgage does not absolve the obligor of their obligation and entitles the holder of the mortgage to foreclose.

A woman owned land across the street that did not have direct ocean access. For $10,000, the man executed a deed titled \u201cGrant of Pedestrian Right-of-Way\u201d to the woman and \u201cher heirs and assigns\u201d over a designated strip of his land between the street and the ocean. The deed was never recorded. Several years later, the woman sold her land. The woman made no mention of the easement, and the buyer had no actual notice of it. After the buyer took possession of the land, neighbors informed her about the pedestrian easement over the man\u2019s land, but when the buyer attempted to use the easement, the man informed her that it was no longer available and constructed a chain-link fence to block the way. The buyer promptly sued the man to establish her right to use the easement. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The buyer, because the easement was appurtenant to her land.\nB. The buyer, because the man received $10,000.\nC. The man, because the buyer purchased the land without notice.\nD.

An easement by prescription is an easement that arises where one party, relying on the silence of the other party, uses the other party's land for a continuous period of time. In this case, the woman relied on the silence of the man and used the man's land for a continuous period of time. Because the easement was acquired by prescription, it is an easement that runs with the land and is appurtenant to the buyer's land. B is incorrect. The fact that the man received $10,000 is irrelevant to whether the easement was acquired by gift. C is incorrect. Non-possessory easements (easements other than easements of re-entry) are usually created in one of two ways: by grant or by implication. In this case, the easement was created by grant when the man deeded the easement to the woman. D is incorrect. An easement in gross is an easement that benefits a single individual.

Answer B is incorrect. The fact that the man received $10,000 is irrelevant. The man granted the woman an easement appurtenant, which runs with the dominant estate. An easement appurtenant may be granted by purchase or by gift. Answer C is incorrect. The buyer did purchase the land without any type of notice, but this is not a reason for the man to prevail. The easement is for the benefit of whoever owns the land. The buyer can still assert her right to the easement appurtenant because the easement has not terminated.   Answer D is incorrect.

The nephew then demanded immediate payment from the niece for half of the mortgage payments he had made. The niece refused. If the nephew sues the niece for contribution, who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of exoneration.\nB. The nephew, because without his payments, the bank could have foreclosed the mortgage and they could have lost the land.\nC. The niece, because any such payment is not due until a partition proceeding is held.\nD. The niece, because the nephew did not seek or obtain her consent before he made the payments.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The doctrine of exoneration allows a party to reimburse another party for expenses incurred by that party in saving a common interest. Here, the nephew and the niece have a common interest in the land, namely, its ownership. The nephew incurred expenses in saving the land, namely, the payment of the mortgage. The niece does not have to pay the nephew for his expenses, but she may reimburse him if she chooses. B is incorrect. This is a common misconception about the exoneration doctrine. The doctrine of exoneration allows one party to reimburse another party for expenses incurred by that party in saving a common interest. It does not, however, allow one party to force another party to incur such expenses in the first place. Here, the niece is not required to pay the nephew for the mortgage payments. C is incorrect. This is also a common misconception about the exoneration doctrine. The doctrine of exoneration allows one party to reimburse another party for expenses incurred by that party in saving a common interest. It does not, however, allow one party to force another party to incur such expenses in the first place. D is correct. The niece will likely prevail because the nephew's failure to obtain her permission before making the payments deprived her of an opportunity to decide whether to make the payments herself.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The nephew and the niece inherited the vacant land as tenants in common. While neither is personally liable on the mortgage, their failure to pay could result in a foreclosure. To avoid foreclosure, payment must be made to the bank, and as co-tenants, each is responsible for his or her share of the mortgage payment. The nephew paid more than his pro rata share and thus may recover the amount owed by the niece in a contribution action. Answer A is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration applies when land that is subject to a mortgage is acquired at the time of death and an attempt is made by the specific legatee to claim that the mortgage must be paid from general estate assets, a scenario that does not exist here. Answer C is incorrect. A partition action is not required before bringing an action for contribution for making mortgage payments that, if not made, might have resulted in the foreclosure on the property by the bank. Answer D is incorrect. Each tenant in common is required to make his or her pro rata share of payments such as mortgage payments, which if not paid could result in foreclosure on the property.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The contract may be avoided if the other party makes it difficult to perform, or if the time for performance is extended beyond a reasonable time. The buyer's avoidance of the contract due to the existence of the restrictive covenant would appear to be caused by matters within the control of the seller, and therefore would not constitute a material adverse change. B is incorrect. Specific performance is generally only available when the subject property is unique or of considerable value. A buyer's refusal to close on a contract for the purchase of vacant land would appear to make the property unique, and thus specific performance would be available. D is incorrect. The seller's lack of knowledge of the buyer's plans for the property would not preclude a court from ordering specific performance. The seller would not have the ability to avoid the contract simply because it was unaware of the buyer's plans. C is correct.

The buyer made timely payments to the investor for two years but then defaulted on the loan. After the buyer failed to cure the default, the investor accelerated the debt and commenced a foreclosure action. The buyer\u2019s defense in the foreclosure action is that the investor is not the mortgagee and therefore has no right to foreclose.

The bank's title was limited by the mortgage, and the investor's title is also limited by the mortgage. The mortgage was not extinguished by the assignment of the note because the investor stepped into the bank's shoes and took title subject to the mortgage. A is incorrect because the mortgage did not have to accompany the assignment of the note.

D is incorrect because the failure of the bank to record the assignment of the mortgage to the investor did not affect the investor's rights in the property.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA woman agreed to purchase 1,000 tablets of a prescription drug from undercover narcotics agents. The agents told the woman that they would steal the drugs from a pharmacy. The next day, the agents met the woman and told her that they had the tablets in a bag. The bag did in fact contain tablets of the drug, but the agents had not stolen the tablets. The woman paid the agents. She told them that she did not want to take possession of the bag and that instead they should deliver it to her friend waiting in a car across the street. The agents, after delivering the bag to the woman\u2019s friend, arrested both the woman and her friend. Can the woman properly be convicted of attempting to receive stolen property?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the agents entrapped the woman.\nB. No, because the drugs were not stolen property.\nC. No, because the woman never attempted to possess the drugs.\nD. Yes.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. The woman did not know that the agents were not stealing the drugs. At the time she agreed to purchase the drugs, she believed that the agents were stealing them. That is, she was deceived by the agents, and the crime of attempted larceny or attempted receiving of stolen property requires that the person know the object of the attempted theft is stolen. Here, the woman did not know that the drugs were stolen, so she cannot be convicted of attempted larceny or receiving of stolen property. B is incorrect. The fact that the agents did not steal the drugs defeats the charge of receiving stolen property, but it does not defeat the charge of attempted receiving stolen property. The woman can be charged with attempting to receive stolen property even if the stolen property is not actually received. D is correct. The woman can be convicted of attempting to receive stolen property because she had the agents deliver the drugs to her friend.

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement.

C is incorrect because the woman misappropriated $80,000 of trust funds, so she is guilty of embezzlement of $80,000.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

After the party was over, she got into her car and sped off. While driving 70 mph in a 30-mph zone, she struck and killed a pedestrian. Blood tests revealed that her blood alcohol content had been more than twice the legal limit at the time of the accident. The woman was tried for murder.

Voluntary manslaughter.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. At common law, a defendant could be found guilty of murder not only for an intentional killing but also for causing another's death by actions intended to cause serious bodily injury short of death. The victim's death, in such cases, is called \"collateral damage\" and does not make the defendant any less guilty of murder. Here, the woman intentionally caused another's death by actions intended to cause serious bodily injury. Although she did not have the required mental state for murder, she did have it for involuntary manslaughter. The defense of involuntary manslaughter should be raised at the close of the evidence, and the court should instruct the jury on that defense. A is incorrect. Depraved-heart murder is a common law murder variant that exists at common law in some jurisdictions. It is not a viable defense to the murder charge in this fact pattern. The victim's death would not be considered collateral damage to the defendant's actions. D is incorrect. The defense of voluntary manslaughter is generally available only when the defendant had the required mental state for murder (intention or knowledge) but did not have the required mental state for involuntary manslaughter (negligence). Here, the defendant had the required mental state for involuntary manslaughter (negligence) and should not be given the benefit of the defense of voluntary manslaughter.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

On the facts described, a jury could potentially conclude that the woman did not act with the sort of aggravated recklessness necessary to constitute depraved-heart homicide or extreme-indifference murder, even though she was intoxicated and driving in an unlawful manner. Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself. Even if understood as the offense of \u201cpublic intoxication,\u201d this offense would be a poor choice because public intoxication is not a lesser included offense of murder.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

They asked a friend to drive them to the bank without telling him that they intended to rob it. The friend waited in his car outside the bank while the women went in. Suddenly, the two women rushed from the bank holding bags of money as alarms sounded. The friend drove the women back to their apartment.

No crime.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The friend knew that the women were planning to rob a bank, and he helped them by driving them there. At common law, one could be found guilty of robbery merely by having the required mental state and failing to prevent a robbery. Today, most jurisdictions have adopted the \"joint enterprise\" or \"concert of action\" theory of liability for robbery. Under this theory, one can be found guilty of robbery if one has the required mental state and takes some action that aids the commission of the crime. In this case, the friend took action by driving the women to the bank. Because the friend's actions aided the commission of the crime, he can be found guilty of robbery. A is incorrect because the friend would not be an accessory after the fact to bank robbery because he did not knowingly assist the perpetrators after the robbery was committed. C is incorrect because the women did not agree to commit the robbery with the friend. The friend could, however, be found guilty of robbery himself.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

The defendant, now charged with sexual assault, has moved to suppress the DNA sample. The issue is whether the police collection of the defendant\u2019s DNA sample was a constitutional violation. The fact that the defendant did not object to the collection of his DNA sample is irrelevant to the constitutional analysis. It is well-established that a defendant does not need to raise a constitutional objection at the time of the incident to preserve it for appeal. Failure to raise the objection in a timely manner simply means that the burden of persuasion shifts to the government to show that the law was properly applied. Here, the burden shifts to the government to show that the police collection of the defendant\u2019s DNA was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The government will prevail in this case because the collection of the defendant\u2019s DNA was a search, and the police did not have a warrant or the defendant\u2019s consent to the search. The police could have obtained a warrant to collect the defendant\u2019s DNA, but they did not do so because they were relying on the state statute that required them to collect DNA from all felony arrestees.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
