The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

An applicable statute provided that, for purposes of distributing an estate after a common disaster, there was a rebuttable presumption that neither spouse had survived the other. A witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane she heard what she thought was a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d although by the time the two occupants were removed from the wreckage they were both dead. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.\nB. No, because the witness\u2019s testimony is too speculative to support a finding.\nC. Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.\nD.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\n The officer is testifying about a tape recording that is being offered into evidence. The officer is not the maker of the tape recording, and thus the tape recording is not being offered under the hearsay exception for a statement made by a person who personally knew the circumstances. The officer is simply authenticating the tape recording, so that the jury may believe that it is what the officer said at the time that she made her notes. Because the officer is authenticating the tape recording, it is being offered under the \"authenticating opinion\" hearsay exception, which applies to \"testimony that a statement is what a declarant or victim would reasonably expect to be available as a result of official action.\" The officer is testifying as an expert, as she is opining as to the accuracy of the tape recording and her current memory of the facts. The officer is thus testifying as an expert, which triggers the application of the relevant evidence code. Because the officer is testifying as an expert, the tape recording is being offered under the \"opinion of a witness\" hearsay exception, which applies to \"a statement or opinion of a witness, if ... the testimony as to the statement or opinion is within the knowledge or personal memory of the witness.\" The officer's testimony is within her personal memory, because she is testifying about a tape recording that she made.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

At trial, the prosecutor called the bank teller to testify that the signature on the check was forged. Is the bank teller\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because a bank teller is by occupation an expert on handwriting.\nB. Yes, because it is rationally based on the bank teller\u2019s perception and is helpful to the jury.\nC. No, because the bank teller was at fault in allowing loss of the original by failing to secure the check.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The teller's identification of the defendant as the bank robber was based on her identification of his voice at the lineup. The teller's identification was not based on her own personal knowledge or observation of the defendant's identity, but instead was based on the defendant's compelled speech at the lineup. The defendant's speech was testimonial, because it was communicative and was made in response to a question asked by the police, namely, to identify the robber. The defendant's invocation of his right to remain silent and his right to have a lawyer present before speaking at the lineup led the police to conduct a custodial interrogation, which led to the defendant's compelled speech at the lineup, and thus the identification of the defendant as the bank robber. The defendant's invocation of his rights led the police to cease questioning him, but that did not end the police's interrogation of the defendant. The police continued to interrogate the defendant by having him participate in the lineup, which was an attempt to elicit incriminating statements from the defendant.

The illegality of the grand jury proceeding does not render the evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search of the witness's home inadmissible, because the two violations of the witness's constitutional rights did not arise from the same facts.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun. The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to suppress its use as evidence. Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.\nB. Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.\nC. No, because, having found the package, the agents had probable cause to believe more narcotics could be located in\nthe house and the gun was found in a proper search for narcotics.\nD.

The police had a reasonable suspicion that the man was involved in the bank robberies, which led them to stop and question him. The man's failure to answer the officers' questions prompted them to conduct a protective, or \"investigatory,\" stop. The officers had a reasonable suspicion, but not probable cause, to conduct this stop. Because the officers had a reasonable suspicion but not probable cause to stop the man, they did not violate the man's Fourth Amendment rights by conducting a frisk. The man's failure to answer the officers' questions and his pacing led the officers to conduct a protective, or \"investigatory,\" stop, which led to the officer's frisk of the man. The officers did not violate the man's Fourth Amendment rights by conducting a frisk, because they had a reasonable suspicion, but not probable cause, to conduct the stop.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

One evening, unaware of the hit man\u2019s presence, the neighbor tripped as he was walking toward his house, falling and hitting his head against the front steps.

The woman hired a hit man to kill the neighbor, which was an unlawful use of deadly force. The hit man\u2019s use of deadly force was an unlawful attempt to kill the neighbor, which is an attempt to commit murder. The woman is not guilty of conspiracy, because there is no evidence that she joined with the hit man in any agreement to commit murder.

Narcotics officers went to her neighborhood in the middle of the night. Nothing unlawful could be seen from the street, so the officers walked into the neighbors\u2019 yard and looked through the woman\u2019s kitchen window, which had neither drapes nor shades. The officers observed what appeared to be marijuana plants being cultivated under grow lights in the kitchen. Using this information, the officers obtained a search warrant. The execution of that warrant netted numerous marijuana plants. The woman was charged with possession of marijuana. She moved to suppress the marijuana plants recovered when the warrant was executed, claiming that the evidence supporting the warrant was obtained through a search that violated the Fourth Amendment. Should the marijuana plants be suppressed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because regardless of the lawfulness of the police conduct beforehand, they did obtain a warrant to search the\nwoman\u2019s home.\nB. No, because the woman could have no reasonable expectation of privacy concerning activities that she exposed to the\nview of her neighbors.\nC. Yes, because the officers\u2019 clandestine observation of the plants violated the woman\u2019s reasonable expectation of\nprivacy concerning activities occurring in her home.\nD.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The next day, he returned to the factory floor and indiscriminately fired shotgun rounds in the air. The man later testified, without contradiction, that he had not intended to kill anyone but simply sought to exact revenge on the factory\u2019s owners by shutting down operations for the day. Unfortunately, one of the bullets ricocheted off the wall and killed the man\u2019s best friend. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n Manslaughter is defined as a killing that is not premeditated but is the result of a sudden, violent emotion, as in this case, the man's anger. Murder is a premeditated killing, and assault is an attempt to inflict injury on another person. The man's actions were not an attempt to injure anyone; they were an effort to shut down the factory's operations.

The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization\u2019s request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization\u2019s placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator\u2019s decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the administrator\u2019s denial of space to the organization was a reasonable time, manner, and place\nrestriction of speech.\nB. No, because a public official may not allow the use of public facilities for the propagation of a message that he or she\nbelieves may create a false or misleading impression.\nC. Yes, because a public official may not refuse to permit the dissemination of a message in a public forum wholly on the\nbasis of its content unless that denial is necessary to serve a compelling government interest.\nD. Yes, because a public official may not refuse to allow the use of any public facility to publish a message dealing with\nan issue of public concern.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nFirst_amendment\n\n## Explanation\n The administrator's decision to deny the organization space for its placard was not a \"time, place, or manner\" restriction on speech, as answer choice A states. A \"time, place, or manner\" restriction is a limitation on when, where, or how a person may engage in expressive conduct. The administrator's decision was a refusal to permit the organization to use the city's buses to convey a message, which is not a \"time, place, or manner\" restriction. Answer choice A is incorrect. Answer choice B is also incorrect. The administrator did not refuse to permit the organization to use the city's buses to convey a message because the administrator believed that the message would create a false or misleading impression. The administrator refused to permit the organization to use the city's buses to convey a message because the administrator believed that the organization's message would offend the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its own messages on the buses. The administrator's decision was not based on the content of the organization's message but on the effect that the organization's message would have on the circus. Answer choice B is incorrect. Answer choice C is correct. The administrator's decision was not a \"content-based\" restriction on speech, as answer choice C states. A \"content-based\" restriction is a law that burdens speech based on the idea or message it conveys. The administrator's decision was not based on the idea or message that the organization's placard conveyed but on the organization's decision to convey that idea or message in a particular place. The administrator's decision was a refusal to permit the organization to use the city's buses to convey a message, which is not a \"content-based\" restriction. Answer choice D is incorrect. The administrator did not refuse to permit the organization to use the city's buses to convey a message because the organization's message dealt with an issue of public concern. The administrator refused to permit the organization to use the city's buses to convey a message because the administrator believed that the organization's message would offend the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its own messages on the buses.

The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community\u2019s residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens\u2019 group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill. The agency officials moved to dismiss. Which of the following is the most appropriate basis for the court to dismiss this suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nB. The interest of the state in obtaining suitable sites for toxic waste landfills is sufficiently compelling to justify the\nselection of the community as a location for such a facility.\nC.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA recently established law school constructed its building in a quiet residential neighborhood. The law school had obtained all of the necessary municipal permits for the construction of the building, which included a large clock tower whose clock chimed every hour. The chimes disturbed only one homeowner in the neighborhood, who had purchased her house prior to the construction of the building. The homeowner was abnormally sensitive to ringing sounds, such as bells and sirens, and found the chimes to be extremely annoying. In a nuisance action by the homeowner against the law school, will the homeowner prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the chimes interfere with the homeowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her property.\nB. Yes, because the homeowner purchased her house prior to the construction of the building.\nC. No, because the chimes do not disturb the other residents of the neighborhood.\nD. No, because the law school had the requisite municipal permits to erect the clock tower.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The delivery service then entered into a contract with an airline company to provide an airplane to deliver the food. The contract between the delivery service and the airline company was also terminable at will. The food company was displeased with the airline company because of a previous business dispute between them. Upon learning of the delivery service\u2019s contract with the airline company, the food company terminated its contract with the delivery service in order to cause the airline company to lose the business.

A buyer gave the seller a signed handwritten offer to purchase the house. The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller\u2019s home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\n The seller is asserting a right to enforce the contract, so he is the one who will be found to be successful in court. The buyer is asserting that the contract is void, so he will be the one who will be found to be unsuccessful in court. Because this question asks us to determine the likely reason for a court's decision, we must assume that the court will decide in favor of the seller. The seller is the one who will be found to be successful, so we must determine which answer choice best explains why the court would decide in his favor. The answer choices are all facts that could be used to support a finding for the seller, but answer choice C is the only one that is relevant to this question. Constructive possession passes to the buyer when the seller signs the acceptance, so the buyer was in constructive possession at the time the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured because the seller had let his homeowner's insurance policy lapse, so the seller is not entitled to recovery under that policy. Because the loss was not insured, the seller cannot recover damages from the fire under the doctrine of subrogation, which would have been the next best available remedy for the loss. The seller cannot recover damages from the fire under the doctrine of subrogation, so he will be left to rely on his contract rights. The risk of loss passes to the buyer on the contract date because the buyer is the one who is now in constructive possession of the house, which was the house on the land that was the subject of the contract.

No, because the purchase at the foreclosure sale by the buyer under these facts eliminated the second bank\u2019s junior\nmortgage lien.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nReal_property\n\n## Explanation\n The facts are consistent with the scenario in which a junior lien is wiped out by a senior lien holder's foreclosure sale. Because the second bank did not send a representative to the foreclosure sale, it is not entitled to priority over the senior lien holder, the first bank. The second bank's mortgage is therefore junior to the first bank's mortgage. The doctrine of estoppel by deed does not apply here, because the original owner, the farmer, did not convey title to the second bank. The farmer's purchase of the farm from the buyer was a bona fide purchase for value, and thus did not result in the farmer's title being tainted by fraud or undue influence. The farmer's prompt and proper recording of the deed to the farm also defeated any claim that the second bank's mortgage was senior to the first bank's mortgage. The second bank's mortgage is therefore invalid.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA seller who owned land in fee simple entered into a valid written agreement to sell the land to a buyer by installment purchase. The contract stipulated that the seller would deliver to the buyer, upon the payment of the last installment due, \u201ca warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\u201d The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The buyer entered into possession of the land. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the buyer discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on the land, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25 percent of the purchase price that the buyer had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the seller had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the seller. The value of the land was then four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller\u2019s alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the buyer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nB. Yes, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a mortgage and the outstanding mortgage impairs the\nbuyer\u2019s equity of redemption.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\n The question asks us to determine whether a damages award is appropriate here. The facts are clear that the buyer is entitled to damages. The buyer's possession of the land is by virtue of the contract with the seller, which is an \"installment purchase contract.\" The answer choice that best explains why the buyer is entitled to damages is answer choice B. An installment purchase contract is treated as a mortgage, and the mortgage here impairs the buyer's equity of redemption. That is, the buyer has no right to possess the land free and clear of the mortgage. The buyer is entitled to damages because the seller breached the contract by failing to deliver marketable title. The seller's failure to deliver marketable title is a breach because the contract clearly states that the seller is to deliver a \"warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\" The seller's failure to deliver such a deed is a breach of the \"duty to convey marketable title\" that is implied in an installment purchase contract.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

The seller has made all mortgage payments timely.

The buyer thought it so unlikely that a canal would be built that the closing should occur notwithstanding this outstanding easement. Therefore, the buyer notified the seller on April 28 that he would expect to close on May 1. When the seller refused to close, the buyer sued for specific performance. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the easement renders the seller\u2019s title unmarketable.\nB. No, because rights of third parties are unresolved.\nC.

A brother and sister owned the land as tenants in common, the brother owning a one-third interest and the sister owning a two-thirds interest. Neither of them owned any other real property.

The sister's parcel is too small to meet the zoning requirement for a buildable lot, and the brother's parcel cannot be made to meet the zoning requirement by adding enough land from the sister's parcel.

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \u201cIt is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\u201d Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor\u2019s intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor\u2019s proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000. The buyer knew nothing of the friend\u2019s mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot. Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her bank of the mortgage claimed by the investor\u2019s friend, the bank loaned her $15,000, and she gave the bank a note for $15,000 due in two years secured by a mortgage on the lot. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. At that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cNo conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\u201d Both notes are now due and both the investor and the buyer have refused to pay.

The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee\u2019s will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. The grantee\u2019s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might\nhave.\nC. The two tracts of land were not adjacent parcels of real estate, and thus the right to purchase is in gross and is\ntherefore unenforceable.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\n Because the right to purchase is in gross, it is not enforceable. A right to purchase is in gross when it is unconditional and is not granted to a person who has an interest in the property. Here, the grantor is not attempting to purchase the larger tract; instead, he is attempting to force the sale of the smaller tract. The right to purchase is thus in gross. The rule against perpetuities is that a transfer cannot be valid if it cannot be ascertained with certainty that it will be performed within 21 years after the death of a person who is alive at the time the transfer is made.

In this case, the price for the purchase was to be set by three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers and was thus fair.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA buyer and a seller entered into a contract for the sale of 10,000 novelty bracelets.

If he rejects it, he will not be able to recover damages for breach of contract, because his rejection will waive his right to recover damages. The seller's failure to send a notice of accommodation did not prevent him from shipping a nonconforming item, which will be considered an unacceptable variation from the contract. That is, the seller's failure to send a notice of accommodation does not make the seller's shipment an acceptance of the buyer's offer.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The contract expressly required that the excavator begin work on June 1 to enable other subcontractors to install utilities. On May 15, the excavator requested a 30-day delay in the start date for the excavation work because he was seriously behind schedule on another project. When the contractor refused to grant the delay, the excavator stated that he would try to begin the work for the contractor on June 1. Does the contractor have valid legal grounds to cancel the contract with the excavator and hire a replacement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the excavator committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract by causing the contractor to feel\ninsecure about the performance.\nB. Yes, because the excavator breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nC. No, because the excavator would be entitled to specific performance of the contract if he could begin by June 1.\nD.

The clerk\u2019s position would be terminated due to the dissolution, and he did not have a retirement plan. The accountant and the bookkeeper informed the clerk of their plan to fund an annuity for him. The clerk, confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity, purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100,000 to fund the annuity, but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50,000. The accountant agreed that the bookkeeper should contribute only $50,000. Does the clerk have a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the clerk was bound by the modification of the agreement made by the accountant and the bookkeeper.\nB. No, because the clerk was only a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper, and\nhad no vested rights.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\n The clerk's reliance on the promised annuity is what led him to purchase the retirement home.

The clerk is not bound by the modification of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper because he was not a party to that agreement. The clerk is only a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper. That is, the clerk is the person for whom the accountant and the bookkeeper established the annuity. The clerk therefore has no vested rights in the annuity. The clerk's reliance on the promised annuity is what led him to rely on his own financial security and to purchase the retirement home.

On March 2, the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer\u2019s order was for a rush job, the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day\u2019s delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25,000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25,000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5,000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid, which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic\u2019s best defense to the textile company\u2019s action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
