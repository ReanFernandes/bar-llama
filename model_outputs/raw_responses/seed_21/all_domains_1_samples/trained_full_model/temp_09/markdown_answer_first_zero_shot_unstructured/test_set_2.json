Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nThis question asks about the constitutionality of a state law. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a law that impairs a vested property right is per se unconstitutional unless the law is necessary to serve a compelling government interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. Here, the law does not impair a vested property right. When the owner of less than 1% of an oil and gas tract dies, his or her property interest is extinguished. But the owner had no property interest in the tract at any time before the death. Because the law does not impair a vested property interest, it does not violate the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, letter D is correct. A, B, and C are incorrect.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

Here, the man was a debtor, and the creditor was attempting to enforce a judgment against the man\u2019s home, which was protected by a generally applicable exemption under state law. Although the man had moved to the state only six months before the creditor obtained its judgment, the man had been a resident of the state for two years before that, and therefore qualified to receive the exemption. The amendment at issue here therefore was enacted by Congress pursuant to its power to regulate bankruptcy. Here, the man was not engaged in a commercial activity that was beyond the reach of federal regulation, and the man was not within the scope of the commandeering doctrine. Therefore, the amendment was not unconstitutional. The two-year residency requirement was rationally related to the federal policy of preventing debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home-exemption law.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Where there is no ongoing violation of a constitutional right and no circumstances that might give rise to a future violation, a case is moot and the court will dismiss it. Here, the homeowner has been deprived of no right, and there is no live controversy between the parties. The fact that the city's ordinance passed after the lawsuit was filed does not make the case ripe. The ordinance does not give rise to a violation of the homeowner's constitutional right to procedural due process. Because the facts do not give rise to a case or controversy, the court will dismiss the suit. A is incorrect. The U.S. Supreme Court has found that a one-time decision by a state actor to remove a person from a position or to deny him a license to practice a profession, even though that decision is not based on a constitutional violation, is not susceptible to repetition and is therefore not subject to review. The facts of this case do not involve a one-time decision to remove a person from a position or to deny him a license to practice a profession. Rather, the facts involve the ongoing activity of installing electric meters. B is incorrect. Because the facts of this case do not involve a case in which a party was detained or threatened with arrest, and the facts do not involve a case in which a decision is being challenged as having been procured by a procedural violation that deprived the decision maker of the evidence necessary to a decision, the case is not moot. The facts do involve a constitutional challenge to the city's meter-replacement plan. If the city had continued to follow its unconstitutional plan and had refused to install a new meter in the homeowner's house, the facts could be said to involve a case in which the city's conduct was ongoing and in which the homeowner was being denied a license to practice his profession. But here, the city has voluntarily ceased its unconstitutional activity--that is, it has stopped installing the meters without obtaining prior notice and consent. That voluntary cessation does not moot the case, because the homeowner still seeks to enjoin the challenged activity--the removal or replacement of any electric meter--without the prior notice and consent that are required by the city's new ordinance. C is incorrect.

The Commerce Clause prohibits states from passing laws that discriminate against or unduly burden the flow of interstate commerce. Here, the ordinance burdens the interstate commerce of selling vegetables from out of state at the city's farmers' market. However, the ordinance can be enforced without burdening any in-state farmers, who would have an equal obligation to sell only vegetables grown within the city limits. Because the ordinance is not necessary to advance a valid local interest, it is unconstitutional and the farmer may sell his vegetables at the city's farmers' market. This situation is similar to a case in which a state law prohibited out-of-state milk producers from shipping milk into a state.

The city council has received many complaints from residents claiming that the billboards are ugly and detract from picturesque sights along the roadways. In response to these complaints, the city council has enacted an ordinance that substantially limits the number and the size of billboards that may be erected along designated scenic roadways. A company that owns many of the billboards affected by this ordinance has filed suit, claiming that the ordinance violates the company\u2019s freedom of speech.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Where the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, Congress may determine that jurisdiction to be concurrent with that of other federal courts, as long as the statute is constitutional. Here, the court has original jurisdiction over all cases involving disputes between states or foreign governments and original jurisdiction over cases involving disputes between two or more states. The court has no original jurisdiction over actions brought against federal officials or officers. Here, because the defendant is a military officer, the court has no original jurisdiction. Therefore, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over this action only if Congress has authorized the court to hear the case, and Congress has done so by vesting in the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over all cases involving official misconduct by military officers. Here, Congress has done so. Therefore, the statute is constitutional, and answer D is correct. A is incorrect. The Constitution vests the power to set the standards of conduct for military personnel in the President as commander in chief. The President, however, may be sued in his or her official capacity. If the defendant is sued in his or her personal capacity, then the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction. However, here, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only because Congress has vested it with that jurisdiction. Therefore, answer A is incorrect. B is incorrect. Article III of the Constitution provides that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in cases involving a dispute between two or more states or between a state and a citizen of another state. Because the defendant is a military officer, the Supreme Court has no original jurisdiction over this case. Congress, however, may vest the Supreme Court with original jurisdiction over cases that the Constitution has not expressly committed to the jurisdiction of any other court. Here, Congress has done so by vesting the Supreme Court with original jurisdiction over all cases involving official misconduct by military officers. Therefore, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over this case only because Congress has vested it with that jurisdiction. Thus, the court has original jurisdiction only because Congress has authorized the court to hear the case, and Congress has done so by vesting in the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over all cases involving official misconduct by military officers. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. C is incorrect. Article I of the Constitution vests in Congress the power to establish federal courts and to vest jurisdiction in those courts. The Constitution does not vest the legislature with the power to establish military tribunals.

Here, the speech at issue\u2014videos depicting violent executions\u2014is sufficiently \"offensive\" to be protected by the First Amendment. Because the city did not demonstrate that the demonstration was patently offensive to the community, the denial of the permit was unconstitutional. Thus, the correct answer is D. A is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. In Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency. Here, the police lawfully knocked and announced their presence at the door. That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the police conduct\u2014knocking and announcing their presence\u2014was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.",

However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence.

However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing.

No, because the jury effectively acquitted the defendant of first-degree murder.\nB. No, because the vindictive-prosecution doctrine precludes punishing the defendant for taking the appeal.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was the one who sought a lesser included offense instruction.\nD. Yes, because the jury never returned a verdict on the first-degree murder charge.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n D is correct. When a jury cannot agree on a verdict on the charging document, the jury\u2019s failure to return a verdict is treated as a verdict of acquittal on that charge (Collins v. Loisell, 262 U.S. 426, 429 (1923)). Thus, the jury\u2019s verdict of second-degree murder was equivalent to a verdict of acquittal on the first-degree murder charge (see People v. Collins, 67 N.Y.2d 320, 324, 502 N.E.2d 1100, 1102 (1986); United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 49 (1992)). Thus, the defendant can be retried on the original charge of first-degree murder. A is incorrect. Because the jury was instructed on both first-degree and second-degree murder and found the defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of second-degree murder, the jury effectively acquitted the defendant of first-degree murder (see People v. Danielson, 9 N.Y.2d 111, 116, 210 N.E.2d 290, 294 (1965)). B is incorrect. The vindictive-prosecution doctrine does not bar retrial when, as here, a defendant has brought the reversal on appeal (Collins v. Loisell, 262 U.S. 426, 429 (1923)). C is incorrect. The defendant was the one who requested that the jury be instructed on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder (People v. Danielson, 9 N.Y.2d 111, 116, 210 N.E.2d 290, 294 (1965)).\n",

Three witnesses testified for the state that the defendant approached the victim in a bar, engaged in a brief conversation with him, and then, without warning, drew a gun and shot the victim in the stomach. One witness for the state testified that just before the defendant drew his gun and shot the victim, the victim twice kicked the defendant in the groin.

The defendant requested that the jury be instructed on voluntary manslaughter based upon heat of passion from adequate provocation.

No, because the defendant did not meet his burden of producing evidence of heat of passion from adequate provocation.\nB. No, because the weight of the evidence indicated that the victim did nothing amounting to adequate provocation.\nC.

The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis.

After trial, defense counsel learned that the prosecution had failed to disclose that the key witness against the defendant had previously been convicted of perjury in another case. The defense filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court rejected the defense argument and upheld the conviction because state discovery rules did not require the disclosure.

Can the state appellate court overturn the conviction based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the witness\u2019s prior perjury conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Where there is an evidentiary burden to be met and the evidence is relevant to meeting that burden, the failure to disclose the evidence will support a finding that the prosecutor violated the Constitution, even if the evidence would not have changed the verdict. In this situation, the prosecutor failed to disclose the witness's perjury conviction. Thus, the prosecutor violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment right to due process by failing to disclose evidence that could have affected the jury's verdict. Here, the prosecutor knew that this witness had a prior perjury conviction but failed to disclose it to the defense. The court will therefore find that the prosecutor's failure to disclose the witness's perjury conviction violated the defendant's constitutional rights, and the conviction will be overturned. If there was a prosecutorial misconduct that violated the defendant's constitutional rights, the conviction will be reversed even if the error was harmless and the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If, however, the prosecutorial misconduct did not violate the defendant's constitutional rights, the error will be deemed harmless and the conviction will stand.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Pursuant to United States v. Martinez, 528 U.S. 304 (2000), when a defendant fails to object to a violation of his or her constitutional rights at trial, the relevant inquiry on appeal is whether the error was \"plain\" or whether it affected the defendant's \"substantial rights.\" If either of these two showing is met, the error may be corrected even if the defendant did not preserve the error by timely objecting at trial. Here, the testimony at issue was erroneously admitted, and the defendant did not preserve his right to challenge that admission by failing to object at trial. Thus, the appeals court may correct the error if it finds that the error was plain and affected the defendant's substantial rights. A is incorrect. Under the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993), the failure to object waives all but the most obvious errors. Because the defendant did not timely object at trial, the defendant is deemed to have waived his right to challenge the erroneous admission of the evidence, and therefore can be penalized with no recovery. B is incorrect. Under the Martinez standard, the reviewing court may reverse a conviction even if the defendant did not waive his or her right to challenge the error by failing to make a timely objection at trial. C is incorrect. Because a reviewing court may correct a constitutional error even if the defendant did not preserve his or her right to challenge the error by failing to make a timely objection at trial, a defendant cannot be penalized for an attorney's failure to make a timely objection.\n",

Answer A is incorrect because, although a defendant\u2019s failure to object can change the standard of appellate review, it does not foreclose review. Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on direct appeal.

Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, \u201cpenalized\u201d by an attorney\u2019s failure to object.

The subcontractor informed the general contractor of the mistake and asked whether the general contractor would agree to pay $15,000 for the foundation, which would cover the subcontractor\u2019s costs. After determining that other subcontractors would charge at least $18,000 for the work, the general contractor agreed in writing.

Where the mistake was unilateral, and the benefit was one that the contract did not contemplate, the injured party must pay the injured party's own out-of-pocket expenses, or the value of the benefit to the injured party. Where the mistake was unilateral, and the benefit was one that the contract did contemplate, the injured party must pay any increased out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the other party, or the amount that the other party would have bargained for in the circumstances of the case. Here, the subcontractor's mistake was unilateral, as it did not arise from a mutual mistake of the parties. The general contractor received a benefit when it was able to have the subcontractor pour a foundation for $18,000, which was $6,000 less than the general contractor should have paid. Because the subcontractor's mistake was to the benefit of the general contractor, the general contractor must pay the value of the benefit, or $6,000.

An intended beneficiary can enforce a contract to which it is not a party, because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302. However, one party to the contract can assert, against the beneficiary, claims for breach by the other party to the contract.

As discussed above, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to do the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for damages against the bank, as an intended beneficiary.

Instead the bank is an intended beneficiary that can enforce a contract to which it is not a party because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary.

And even if the carpenter\u2019s breach was material, the bank could recover the value of the work done for the homeowner as restitution. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374.",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct because the contractor's breach was found to be willful and therefore the man would not have to pay the contractor anything. There is no recovery for unpaid labor because the man did not breach the contract by failing to pay. UCC 2-615(1) provides that recovery is limited to the amount that the party who was not in breach would have paid had the contract been fully performed. Here, the man would not have to pay the $200,000 contract price because the contractor breached by walking off the job. Therefore, the contractor is entitled to nothing. A, B, and C are incorrect. A would be correct if the contractor could recover $60,000, based on the contract price for each of the four services, because the man would have to pay $200,000 even though the contractor did not complete the job. B would be correct if the man had to pay the contractor $60,000 for each of the four services, because the contract was divisible and each service was worth $60,000. C would be correct if the man had to repay the $60,000 the contractor had earned at each stage of the job. Here, the contractor earned $50,000 in payments before breaching, and the man would have to repay that amount to the contractor under UCC 2-615(1).\n",

A party that materially breaches a contract is nevertheless entitled to recover under a theory of restitution the amount of the value of the benefit that the breaching party\u2019s part performance conferred on the victim of the breach. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374. Answer A is incorrect. A breaching party cannot recover on a theory of reliance. Answer B is incorrect. This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation.

The prosecutor wishes to introduce into evidence a ledger found at the defendant\u2019s home during the execution of a search warrant. The ledger includes detailed information regarding the defendant\u2019s purchases and sales of drugs over a two-year period. The prosecutor is considering two alternative ways to lay the foundation for admission of the ledger as a business record. The first alternative is to call the police officer who executed the search warrant to testify that she found the ledger in the defendant\u2019s home. The second alternative is to call a codefendant, who has pled guilty, to testify that he was the defendant\u2019s drug supplier for over two years and that he was present when the defendant used the ledger to record their transactions as well as transactions with other buyers and sellers as they occurred. Which of the following is correct regarding the ledger\u2019s admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ledger may be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant.\nB. The ledger may be admitted through the codefendant but not through the officer.\nC. The ledger may not be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant, because business records may be introduced only through testimony by a records custodian.\nD.

Therefore, the officer is not a proper witness to lay the proper foundation to admit the ledger under the business records exception. The codefendant was present when the defendant used the ledger to record their drug transactions as they occurred, and therefore he can qualify as the requisite \"declarant\" to introduce the ledger under the business records exception. The officer may testify to explain the circumstances of the search that led to the officer's possession of the ledger and to identify the officer as the appropriate witness to authenticate the ledger, but the officer cannot testify as the proper \"declarant\" to lay the proper foundation to admit the ledger.\n",

No, because evidence of routine practice is not admissible when an eyewitness denies that the practice was followed.\nB. No, because issuing insurance policies to individuals is not sufficiently automatic to constitute a routine practice.\nC. Yes, as character evidence that the agent acted in a thorough manner when dealing with customers.\nD. Yes, as evidence of the company\u2019s routine practice.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Evidence of a routine practice is generally inadmissible to rebut the testimony of a defendant who is the eyewitness to a situation and who denies that a particular practice or custom is followed by those who perform the act or activity in question (Utah P & C Ins. Co. v. Widmyer, 983 P.2d 464, 467 (Utah 1999)). However, this rule is not applicable where the proffered evidence involves a situation that is \"sufficiently atypical\" that it can be said to involve a situation where the defendant is not an eyewitness. Here, the insurance company is the defendant, and the issue is whether an agent properly informed a homeowner of the necessity of purchasing a supplemental policy to cover the homeowner\u2019s property. As the Utah Supreme Court explained in Widmyer, when the issue involves the actions of an insurance agent in selling an insurance policy, the defendant is not the eyewitness and the rule against the admission of evidence of the insurance company\u2019s routine practice is inapplicable. Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect. Although the agent is an eyewitness to the issue of whether he properly informed the homeowner of the necessity of purchasing a supplemental policy to cover the homeowner\u2019s property, the issue involves the actions of the insurance company, not those of the agent. Thus, D is correct. B is incorrect. Although the issue involves the actions of an insurance agent in selling an insurance policy, the issue is not one in which the agent is the eyewitness to a situation and must therefore be analyzed under the rule against the admission of evidence of the insurance company\u2019s routine practice (Utah P & C Ins. Co. v. Widmyer, 983 P.2d 464, 467 (Utah 1999)). Therefore, D is correct. C is incorrect. Evidence of the agent\u2019s good character is inadmissible to prove that the agent acted in accordance with that character (People v. Burr, 40 N.Y.2d 589, 596 (1976)). Therefore, D is correct.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The routine practice of the company\u2019s agents in discussing supplemental policy options with customers is admissible under FRE 406. Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury. Answer B is incorrect. To constitute habit evidence, an organization\u2019s practice need not be \u201cautomatic\u201d but only routine\u2014something that is regularly done. The supervisor\u2019s testimony here is that the agents\u2019 regular practice is to discuss supplemental policy options with customers. Answer C is incorrect. Character evidence is not admissible in civil cases to prove conduct. See FRE 404(a) and (b).

State v. Smith, 125 N.H. 579, 582 (1997). Here, the child was called to testify about having seen one of the murders.

Because the woman was not present at the hearing and was not called to testify, the neighbor can testify only to the facts that the defendant ran the red light and that the woman told the neighbor a week later that the defendant had not run the red light.

The attorney brought a federal diversity action against the manager and attached to the complaint a copy of the signed covenant. The attorney also moved for a preliminary injunction, referring to the attached covenant and submitting a supporting affidavit from the company\u2019s president. At the hearing on the preliminary injunction motion, the manager denied ever having signed such a covenant and conclusively demonstrated that the copy of a signed covenant attached to the company\u2019s motion was forged. The court, on its own initiative, ordered the attorney to show cause why the attorney should not be sanctioned under Rule 11. Would sanctions against the attorney be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the court did not give the attorney notice and 21 days to withdraw the preliminary injunction motion.\nB. No, because the motion was supported by evidence that was likely sufficient to satisfy an objectively reasonable attorney.\nC.

In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault.

The attorney had few contacts with State A, and none of the contacts in that state were related to the alleged defamatory emails. After being served in State B with the summons and complaint, the attorney determined that he was not subject to personal jurisdiction in State A and ignored the action. On the company\u2019s motion, the clerk entered a default in the action. After a hearing on damages, the court entered a default judgment for the company. The attorney has moved for relief from the default judgment. What is the attorney\u2019s best argument in support of the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The attorney has a meritorious defense to the action, which he should be allowed to assert.\nB. The attorney\u2019s failure to respond to the service of process was reasonable under the circumstances.\nC. The default judgment is void, because the court did not have personal jurisdiction over the attorney.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Where a defendant fails to appear and a default is entered, a federal district court will grant the relief sought by the opposing party if the opposing party's proof is sufficient, even if the facts are not clearly supported by the evidence (Collins v. Loisell, 262 U.S. 426, 429 (1923)); however, when the default was entered through mistake, misunderstanding, or excusable neglect, the court will grant the relief sought if the plaintiff can prove his case by any evidence (Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c); see McKeever v. Block, 662 F.2d 1286, 1289 (9th Cir. 1981)). Here, the attorney did not respond to the complaint because he believed that he had not been properly served. This belief was based on a misunderstanding that was reasonable in light of the circumstances. Accordingly, the default judgment should be set aside, and the company is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. D is incorrect. The court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant when it has either (1) personal jurisdiction over the defendant or (2) personal jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, and the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court. Here, the court does not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant because the attorney was improperly served. Thus, the default judgment is void and the attorney may properly move to set aside the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule 55(c). C is incorrect. When a federal court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant, a default judgment entered in that defendant's absence is void and may be relieved pursuant to Federal Rule 55(c). Collars v. Loisell, 262 U.S. 426, 429 (1923). A is incorrect. The defendant's failure to appear and a default was entered, a federal district court will grant the relief sought by the opposing party if the opposing party's proof is sufficient, even if the facts are not clearly supported by the evidence (Collins v.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) specifically authorizes relief if the \u201cjudgment is void.\u201d Because the court had no personal jurisdiction over the attorney in the action, the judgment is void.

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a defendant who has been sued in federal court for violating a federal statute may not use that federal court action as a procedural bar to an immediate appeal from a state court judgment entered pursuant to a state law that is virtually identical to the federal law, even though the federal court has not decided the federal claim. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Mitchell v. Maurer, 444 U.S. 90 (1979), is controlling here. There is no just reason for delay in certifying the employees' appeal where they are entitled to immediate review of the district court's grant of summary judgment on the federal-law claims, and the federal-law claims are not separate and distinct from the state-law claims that are being litigated in the district court.\n",

If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

Where a person owns land and has a legal title to the land, such as by purchase or by inheritance, that person will not lose his or her interest in the land when the property is taken by an involuntary sale, such as a mortgage foreclosure. Here, the woman owned land subject to a mortgage held by the bank. When the woman failed to pay her mortgage, the bank properly initiated foreclosure proceedings. The foreclosure sale was an involuntary sale and, therefore, the bank took the woman's equitable interest in the land, which she had by her life estate, and not her legal title to the land. The woman died testate before the foreclosure sale was completed. Thus, when the land was sold at the foreclosure sale, the woman did not have a legal title to the land. Because the woman's will was executed before the mortgage was granted, the woman's will was valid. Therefore, the woman had the power to devise the land to the charity and to leave the remainder of her estate to her brother. The woman's will was therefore valid, and the bank's taking of the woman's equitable interest in the land was an involuntary sale under which the woman's heirs could take. As a result, the woman's brother, as the executor of the woman's estate, could take the surplus proceeds from the foreclosure sale, which had gone to the woman before her death, and hold them for the benefit of the woman's heirs. The woman's heirs would include the woman and the woman's heirs by the woman. The woman had no heirs by the woman, but the woman did have a brother. Because the brother was the sole heir of the woman, he would take the land by the woman's devise and take the remainder of the woman's estate by intestacy. The brother would therefore have the entire estate to which the woman had been entitled. Thus, because the brother was entitled to take the land that the woman had devised to the charity and the remainder of the woman's estate, the brother was entitled to take the surplus proceeds from the foreclosure sale. Therefore, the man was correct, and the woman's brother was entitled to the surplus proceeds from the foreclosure sale.",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The man\u2019s promise to the woman was not supported by consideration, and therefore was not enforceable by the woman. The man\u2019s promise was enforceable, however, by the man and his heirs. Because the entrepreneur had no notice of the man\u2019s promise to the woman, the entrepreneur is not in privity with the man, and the woman has no one to enforce the restriction. Because the woman is therefore not entitled to the benefits of the restriction, the convenience store may operate the land in any manner permitted by state law. Here, the woman has no plans to build on her land or otherwise change its use. The entrepreneur therefore has no duty to search the title to the easterly tract to determine whether the restriction has been violated. Here, the recording act for the relevant jurisdiction provides that an unrecorded promise to a third party is not enforceable by the promisee against a subsequent purchaser for value. Thus, the woman has no equitable right to enforce the restriction against the entrepreneur. Because the woman has no one to enforce the restriction, the convenience store is not bound by the restriction. Thus, the woman has no equitable or legal right to damages for any use of the land that would violate the restriction. Because the woman has no rights to enforce the restriction and no evidence that the entrepreneur has violated the restriction, the entrepreneur will not be held to have actual knowledge of the restriction. Therefore, the entrepreneur will not be charged with constructive notice of the restriction. Because the woman has no one to enforce the restriction and no evidence that the entrepreneur has violated the restriction, the convenience store is not bound by the restriction. Thus, the woman has no equitable or legal right to damages for any use of the land that would violate the restriction.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. A buyer is on constructive notice of all information that a search of the land records would reveal. At issue is whether the entrepreneur had record (constructive) notice of the restriction. If so, the entrepreneur would not be a good-faith purchaser for value. Courts are divided about whether a buyer is required to search deeds outside of the chain of title to the land the buyer is purchasing. Here, the deed from the man to the woman is outside of the entrepreneur\u2019s chain of title even though they share a common grantor. Thus, knowing whether the jurisdiction\u2019s law puts a buyer on notice of all land transfers of the buyer\u2019s grantor, even those outside of the chain of title, is essential. If it does, the entrepreneur had a duty to search the title for the westerly tract. Answer A is incorrect. The type of index does not determine what instruments are in the chain of title. Answer B is incorrect. The recording system does not affect whether the entrepreneur is a good-faith purchaser for value. Answer D is incorrect.

Where the person who signed the deed is not the intended grantor, as where a son forged his father's name to a deed, the deed is void (Donnelly, 266 NY at 146; see also UCC 3-303 [A contract that is signed by a person whom the other party did not intend to be bound is not enforceable by or against that person.][Donnelly, 266 NY at 145-146]. Here, the father signed the deed to the son and the son then promptly conveyed the property to the investor.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it.

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire. Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. Res ipsa loquitur is an evidentiary doctrine that allows the trier of fact to find negligence in a case when the facts are such that negligence could be the only possible explanation for the injury, but that the injured party cannot prove that the negligent party was in fact at fault. The doctrine is used in cases in which the injury would not ordinarily occur without negligence and the plaintiff cannot offer direct evidence as to the defendant's conduct because the defendant did not know the plaintiff was present and damages were therefore impossible to prove. To establish res ipsa loquitur, the plaintiff must show that: (1) the incident was of the kind that ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence; (2) the defendant had exclusive control over the circumstances necessary to the injury; and (3) the defendant's conduct was not reasonable. Here, the farmer's cattle pen was a secure, well-constructed enclosure, and it was the farmer's cattle that escaped. It is the farmer who must prove that he was not negligent; if he cannot do so, the jury may find that the injury was caused by his negligence, even though the plaintiff cannot offer direct evidence that the farmer was at fault. Because the facts here satisfy the necessary elements of res ipsa loquitur, D is correct. A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect. Res ipsa loquitur is only appropriate when the injury would not ordinarily occur absent negligence and the plaintiff cannot offer direct evidence as to the defendant's conduct because the defendant did not know the plaintiff was present and damages were therefore impossible to prove. Here, the trucker could have offered direct evidence that the farmer was negligent because the trucker saw the cattle that the farmer was supposed to be watching. The fact that the trucker could not prove the farmer was negligent because the farmer did not know the trucker was present is not relevant, because the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply when the plaintiff has not been injured by the conduct that the plaintiff cannot prove. B is incorrect. To invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the plaintiff must submit evidence showing that his or her injury was of the kind that ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence.

The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and since the trucker did not contribute to the accident, the jury can infer that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect. The trucker needs to establish that the farmer was in exclusive control of the pen, that the accident would not have occurred but for negligence, and that the accident was not due to the trucker\u2019s own actions.

The rupture resulted from a defect in the tire that existed at the time it was sold by the manufacturer to a retailer, who sold it to the driver and installed it on her car. The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year. After discovering this memorandum, the driver\u2019s attorney filed a timely amended complaint, adding a claim for battery. The manufacturer has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the battery claim, based on the undisputed facts set out above. If no additional facts are provided to the court concerning the risk of tire rupture, should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care to prevent ruptures.\nB. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that consumers would be injured by tire ruptures.\nC. Yes, because a battery claim is inconsistent with a claim for strict products liability.\nD.

There is no evidence that the manufacturer was negligent in the manufacture of the tire or that the manufacturer was aware of and disregarded a risk that a tire would rupture and that the driver would be injured by a tire that had ruptured. The driver can recover damages on a strict products liability claim if he can establish that the manufacturer was negligent in the design or manufacture of the product, that the negligence was the proximate cause of his injury, and that the product was sold by the manufacturer to the injured plaintiff.

Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture.

The construction company mixed the sand with water and cement to make concrete. The distributor knew that an improper ratio of sand, water, and cement would result in defective concrete, but the distributor played no role in determining the ratio used by the construction company in mixing the concrete. The construction company used the concrete to form supporting columns for a building. A year later, the building collapsed during a minor earthquake, causing injury to the occupants.

The defective concrete was a cause in fact of the collapse. Do the injured building occupants have viable strict liability claims against the sand distributor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because component suppliers are not strictly liable in tort.\nB. No, because the distributor neither advised nor participated with the construction company in determining the mixture of sand, water, and cement.\nC.

The defendant is not strictly liable if there was no duty, or if the defendant's conduct was not a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff's injury. A seller of a product is generally not subject to strict liability in tort if the seller is merely a remote distributor or a retailer with no control over the product, but the seller is subject to strict liability if it is a supplier with a special relationship to the injured plaintiff. Here, the sand distributor is subject to strict liability because it had a special relationship with the construction company, which had entered into an implied contract with the sand distributor to provide sand that met certain specifications.

Therefore, there is no \"knowledgeable participant\" as required for the \"implied-consent\" exception to the _Pennsylvania_ rule, and the woman's calls were thus within the protective zone and entitled to the strongest privacy protection, as established by the _Hill_ decision. Thus, the company is not entitled to the jury finding that would be necessary to support a finding that the woman's calls were made with the requisite state of mind for the woman to be liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The woman's claims of invasion of privacy also fail, because the woman did not have a legally protected privacy interest in the information in her phone records that was obtained by the security officer in violation of her privacy.

Intrusion upon seclusion is one of the four privacy torts recognized by the Second Restatement of Torts and most states. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A\u2013E (1977). Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the company did not expressly authorize the security officer\u2019s specific actions does not necessarily allow it to avoid liability.

Here, the student was injured when she entered the unmarked and locked storeroom after being told by the store employee that the empty boxes were in the storeroom. The store was therefore negligent in failing to use reasonable care to avoid harm to the student, who was a licensee entitled to this recovery-based presumption of the store\u2019s negligence ( Dillon, supra, at p. 768; Watts, supra, at p. 240).

The company has moved for summary judgment, based on the undisputed facts set out above. Assume that there is no applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute. How should the court rule on the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny the motion, because the jury must determine the extent of the emotional distress suffered by the dispatcher.\nB. Deny the motion, because there is evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the supervisor failed to act with ordinary care.\nC. Grant the motion, because the dispatcher suffered no physical injury.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n D is correct. The trucking company is a respondeat superior per\u00adson, and the dispatcher must prove that the supervisor's conduct was so egregious that no reasonable person in the supervisor's position could have believed that his or her conduct was appropriate. The dispatcher suffered no physical injury, so the supervisor is not liable as a per\u00adsonal\u00adty for the dispatcher's emotional distress. Because there is no claim against the supervisor as a per\u00adsonal\u00adty, the dispatcher must prove that the supervisor was neg\u00adli\u00adgent in his or her rela\u00adtion\u00adship with the dispatcher. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury. Therefore, there is no evidence that the supervisor failed to act with ordinary care, and summary judgment is appropriate. A, B, and C are incorrect.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Negligently caused emotional distress is ordinarily not actionable unless connected to a physical injury. Answer A is incorrect. Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty. As noted earlier, courts generally do not recognize a duty to take care against causing emotional distress unconnected to a physical injury. Answer D is incorrect.

The manufacturer knew that the distributor would, on the basis of the agreement, invest in an expansion of its distribution centers in State A in order to handle the distribution of the manufacturer\u2019s products to retail sellers in that state. At the time the manufacturer entered into the contract, it had already firmly decided to withdraw from the State A market in two years. Because the distributor had heard rumors of such a plan, its chief executive officer, before signing the contract, asked a representative of the manufacturer whether such a plan was in place.

No, because the distributor\u2019s exclusive remedy is for breach of contract.\nB. No, because the manufacturer did not misstate any material facts when entering into the contract.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Where a manufacturer is negligent in failing to warn a victim of a known or knowable danger associated with a product that the victim would encounter, the victim may recover damages from the manufacturer if the victim was injured by the product. The manufacturer has a duty to warn the victim of the danger if (1) the manufacturer knew or should have known that an ordinary user of the product would not know of the danger, and (2) the danger could be avoided if the user was adequately warned. In this situation, the daughter was not injured by a product that the manufacturer should have warned her about; instead, the daughter was injured by a medication that the manufacturer should have warned the mother about. Because the mother was the percipient tortfeasor in this case, the manufacturer will not be liable to the daughter for failing to warn her about the medication's risks. If the mother had not bought the medication and had not given her daughter a triple dose, the daughter would not have suffered her injury. The mother is therefore responsible for failing to warn the daughter about the danger, and therefore the manufacturer has no duty to warn the daughter. Therefore, D is correct. A, B, and C are incorrect.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",
