Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD. Yes, because the law rationally promotes the legitimate state interest in fostering resource development.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\n This law is constitutional because the government can burden an interest in property so long as it serves a substantial government interest and is not an arbitrary or unreasonable means of serving that interest. Here, the law is designed to encourage efficient use of the oil and gas resources in the state by permitting more efficient and economical extraction by allowing the interests of owners of small percentages of oil and gas rights to be pooled. This law is therefore a rational means of serving the state's legitimate interest in encouraging efficient use of the state's natural resources.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements.

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment. Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home. Six months later, a creditor obtained a judgment against the man for negligently causing a car accident. The creditor now seeks to execute the judgment against the man\u2019s home, but the man has responded that he is entitled to the generally applicable debtor\u2019s home exemption under state law.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\n The man can argue that Congress cannot amend the bankruptcy laws to impose a two-year residency requirement to qualify for the debtor's home exemption, as this would be a violation of the Constitution's Guarantee Clause. The Guarantee Clause provides that \"the Laws of the United States shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. When Congress acts pursuant to its enumerated powers, its actions are presumed to be constitutional. However, when Congress goes beyond its constitutional powers, its actions are invalid. When a law is challenged as being beyond Congress's power to enact, the court will first identify the specific provision of the Constitution that has allegedly been violated and then determine whether the legislative act is consistent with that provision. If the law is not, it will be invalid. In this situation, the man can argue that the two-year residency requirement is a law that violates the Guarantee Clause, as it is a state law that conflicts with the supremacy of federal bankruptcy law. As such, the state law is invalid and the man is entitled to the federal bankruptcy law's exemption of his home from execution.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss.

Here, the Supreme Court would have original jurisdiction over such an action, as the officer is a defendant. Therefore, the Supreme Court would have original jurisdiction over any cause of action against a military officer for official misconduct, and the statute is constitutional. A is incorrect. The president acts as commander in chief of the armed forces, and the Supreme Court is not granted this power. B is incorrect. Article III does not set forth the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, but rather its appellate jurisdiction. C is incorrect. Article I grants Congress the power to create lower federal courts, but does not grant Congress the power to establish military tribunals with original jurisdiction. D is incorrect.

The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development.

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v.

However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A.

Using an online directory that the resident had joined, the police obtained the resident\u2019s cell- phone number. The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment.

Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data.

However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing.

Even      though it is a single witness who recounts this event, a jury can credit a single witness\u2019s testimony. Answer A is incorrect because the state offered evidence of a serious battery on the defendant, which can constitute an adequate provocation, no matter which party presented the evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the judge\u2019s job is not to weigh the evidence but is only to determine whether a reasonable jury could find adequate provocation. The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis.

After trial, defense counsel learned that the prosecution had failed to disclose that the key witness against the defendant had previously been convicted of perjury in another case. The defense filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court rejected the defense argument and upheld the conviction because state discovery rules did not require the disclosure. The defendant then filed an appeal, arguing that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose this prior perjury conviction had violated his federal constitutional rights. Can the state appellate court overturn the conviction based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the witness\u2019s prior perjury conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The prosecutor wishes to introduce into evidence a ledger found at the defendant\u2019s home during the execution of a search warrant. The ledger includes detailed information regarding the defendant\u2019s purchases and sales of drugs over a two-year period. The prosecutor is considering two alternative ways to lay the foundation for admission of the ledger as a business record. The first alternative is to call the police officer who executed the search warrant to testify that she found the ledger in the defendant\u2019s home. The second alternative is to call a codefendant, who has pled guilty, to testify that he was the defendant\u2019s drug supplier for over two years and that he was present when the defendant used the ledger to record their transactions as well as transactions with other buyers and sellers as they occurred. Which of the following is correct regarding the ledger\u2019s admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ledger may be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant.\nB. The ledger may be admitted through the codefendant but not through the officer.\nC. The ledger may not be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant, because business records may be introduced only through testimony by a records custodian.\nD. The ledger may not be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant, because the business records exception to the hearsay rule does not apply to illegal activity.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\n A is correct. The officer would have personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the search, but could be impeached as to his or her truthfulness. The codefendant, however, has firsthand knowledge of the facts that would establish the record's authenticity and would therefore have appropriate personal knowledge to satisfy the requirements of authenticity for the business records exception. The codefendant's testimony would be more probative than the officer's testimony, because the officer was not present when the ledger was created and did not have personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the creation of the ledger.\nB is incorrect. If the officer were called as a witness, he or she could be subject to cross-examination concerning the officer's personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the search, and the officer's credibility would be an issue. The officer would not have personal knowledge of the facts that would establish the authenticity of the ledger.\nC is incorrect. The business records exception to the hearsay rule permits the testimony of a records custodian who has personal knowledge of the record to authenticate a business record. Here, the officer is not a records custodian. The codefendant is a possible witness to testify as a custodian of the ledger, but he is not the only possible custodian. The codefendant is not the only person who could authenticate the ledger through personal knowledge, as the officer could do so if the officer were called as a witness.\nD is incorrect. The business records exception to the hearsay rule applies only to records that were made at or near the time of the events recorded and that were made by a person with knowledge. Here, the ledger was created by the defendant himself as a record of his drug transactions. The activities documented in the ledger were not illegal.\n",

At trial, the plaintiff planned to call several bar patrons who had been present on the night in question to testify to the circumstances of the alleged assault. The trial judge ordered all witnesses excluded from the courtroom during the trial except for the parties. The trial judge then ordered the plaintiff to testify first during his case- in-chief and to relate his version of events before hearing the testimony of other eyewitnesses. The plaintiff has objected to the order requiring him to testify first. Did the trial judge exceed her authority in ordering the plaintiff to testify first?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the trial judge has broad discretion to exercise control over the order of examining witnesses.\nB. No, because the trial judge must determine the order in which evidence is presented at trial.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation. Answer D is incorrect. The trial judge has the discretion to alter the order of proof without a showing of specific prejudice by an opposing party.",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Explanation\n When a statement is offered into evidence, it must be relevant to a fact at issue. Generally, statements are inadmissible when the declarant has a motive to falsify the statement or when the statement was made in the context of a personal relationship that has been damaged by the truthfulness or falsity of the statement. The exception to the hearsay rule allowing statements made in civil cases to be used in subsequent criminal cases is limited to statements that are relevant to prove a person\u2019s state of mind at the time of an act, such as a person\u2019s motive, intent, or knowledge.

At the criminal trial, the prosecutor sought to introduce the driver\u2019s statement to the victim\u2019s decedent during settlement negotiations. The victim\u2019s statement was not made in a personal relationship damaged by the truth or falsity of the statement, nor was it made in a civil case to prove the victim\u2019s state of mind.

When offered by the prosecution, the driver\u2019s statement to the woman is a statement of an opposing party, and therefore it would come within the exception to the hearsay rule set out in FRE 801(d)(2)(A). Answer C is incorrect. FRE 408(a)(2) distinguishes between settlement negotiations involving private parties and those involving a public office. Statements made in negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its enforcement authority may be admissible in a subsequent criminal case.

That is, if the statement would be relevant to prove the facts it describes, a witness may testify as to it, even though the declarant is unavailable to be cross-examined. The statement is relevant to show that the woman did not see the defendant run the red light, because the woman would be expected to testify that the defendant did run the red light and that the defendant therefore was negligent in causing the collision. The statement is also within the scope of the residual hearsay exception to impeach the woman, because her unavailability to be cross-examined would give rise to a presumption that the statement was truthful.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n",

There is no express exception to the general hearsay rule that would allow the investigator to testify about the girlfriend's prior statement. However, there is an implied exception for the circumstances of this case. Where a witness's testimony is incompetent or uncertain because it is based on a prior inconsistent statement, that statement may be proved as necessary to make the testimony understandable. Here, the girlfriend's uncertainty as to when she made the statement goes to the credibility of her testimony. Thus, the investigator's testimony is within this implied exception to the hearsay rule. B is incorrect. The investigator's testimony is hearsay, and the girlfriend's statement is not within any of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. Even if the investigator's testimony were relevant, it would be inadmissible hearsay. C is incorrect. Evidence may be offered to impeach a witness's credibility if the evidence is relevant to a reasonably anticipated question that the witness will be asked. Here, the girlfriend's statement is not being offered to impeach her testimony, so this explanation is inapplicable. The investigator's testimony is being offered to prove the girlfriend's prior statement and to show that her testimony is therefore untrustworthy. D is incorrect. If the investigator were called to testify as a witness, his testimony would be within the hearsay rule's exception for declarations against a declarant's interest, because his testimony would be the girlfriend's prior statement, and his testimony would be offered to prove that the girlfriend's testimony was untrustworthy.

The company\u2019s president told the attorney that the manager had begun working for a competitor and gave the attorney a copy of the signed covenant. The attorney brought a federal diversity action against the manager and attached to the complaint a copy of the signed covenant. The attorney also moved for a preliminary injunction, referring to the attached covenant and submitting a supporting affidavit from the company\u2019s president. At the hearing on the preliminary injunction motion, the manager denied ever having signed such a covenant and conclusively demonstrated that the copy of a signed covenant attached to the company\u2019s motion was forged. The court, on its own initiative, ordered the attorney to show cause why the attorney should not be sanctioned under Rule 11. Would sanctions against the attorney be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the court did not give the attorney notice and 21 days to withdraw the preliminary injunction motion.\nB. No, because the motion was supported by evidence that was likely sufficient to satisfy an objectively reasonable attorney.\nC.

This is a high burden to meet, and the facts here do not support a finding of misconduct. There was no notice and 21-day grace period, as required by Rule 11(b)(1), because the court sua sponte ordered the attorney to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. But the court's order did not allege that the attorney acted in bad faith. The facts support a finding that the attorney's conduct was negligent--he failed to verify the manager's signature and failed to conduct an appropriate investigation into the manager's personal background--but negligence is not the same as bad faith. The facts also do not support a finding that the attorney's conduct was objectively unreasonable. The manager conclusively showed that the attached covenant was a forgery, which meant that the preliminary injunction motion should have been withdrawn. However, the facts do not indicate that the attorney acted with the level of knowledge required to find misconduct under Rule 11. The attorney was not required to verify the manager's signature or conduct an appropriate investigation into the manager's personal background--these duties are on the manager to prove the authenticity of his signature. Here, the manager did not meet his burden to show that the signature was authentic.

The crossclaim is improper, because the general contractor and the subcontractor are opposing parties, not co-parties.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14(a) states that a defendant may join as a co-defendant any person not a party to the action if \"joinder would not enlarge the scope of the proceeding.\" Here, the general contractor and the subcontractor are opposing parties to the underlying diversity action. The general contractor has joined the subcontractor as a necessary party to its crossclaim to assert the subcontractor's alleged sole negligence as a defense to the corporation's breach of contract claims. Because the general contractor and the subcontractor are opposing parties, joinder of the subcontractor is improper. A is incorrect. Federal Rule 8(f) provides that a pleading must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" A pleading may state a legal claim, but it may not state a defense. Here, the general contractor's crossclaim states a defense--that the subcontractor's negligence was the sole cause of the construction delays that injured the corporation. C is incorrect. Generally, a court will not dismiss an indispensable party from an action when the indispensable party has been joined as a party. However, the subcontractor is an indispensable party to the crossclaim, as the general contractor's crossclaim asserts the subcontractor's alleged sole negligence as a defense to the corporation's claims. Because the subcontractor is an indispensable party to the crossclaim, the court will dismiss the crossclaim. D is incorrect. A claim may not be joined with a claim that is entitled to a different recovery or that requires proof of facts not necessary to support recovery on the joined claim.

Answer D is incorrect. The busy schedule of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not establish the good cause needed to amend the scheduling order, which is why the motion should be denied. A party opposing a requested extension would need to show prejudice that would likely result from the extension only if the moving party had first met its burden to show good cause.",

When the defendant answered the complaint and asserted his counterclaim, he was required to file an answer to the complaint. Because he did not do so, the defendant has failed to present his version of the facts to the court and is therefore precluded from presenting evidence to establish his version of the facts.

However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be premature.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

Five weeks after the court entered judgment on the verdict, the defendant filed a renewed motion for JMOL. One week after that motion was filed, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to extend the time to file and respond to posttrial motions.

If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect.

The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it.

At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Generally, a person can obtain a court order to stop a use that is burdening his property interest if the person can prove that the use is a \"per se\" nuisance or that it creates a \"substantial\" interference with the property interest such that the use should be \"limited\" or \"modified\" to avoid such interference. The man is entitled to a variance because his land is being substantially burdened by the zoning law's requirement that any home in the community be surrounded by at least two acres of vacant land. The man could prove that his inability to site his home on his land as required by the zoning law is a per se nuisance, or he could prove that the requirement is not necessary to serve a significant public purpose and that he can be adequately served by a less intrusive use of his land, such as by the construction of a home on the easterly portion of his land. Therefore, the zoning board should grant the requested variance and permit the man to build his daughter's house on the westerly portion of his land. Because there is no bright-line rule stating that a man is entitled to a hardship variance when his property interest is burdened by a use that is permitted by the zoning law, answer D is incorrect. Answer A is incorrect. Generally, a person has no right to a variance where the land is used for residential purposes. This rule is often expressed in a zoning ordinance provision stating that no variance will be granted to allow a use that is not a \"permitted use\" in the relevant zoning district. The man's land is being substantially burdened by the zoning law's requirement that any home in the community be surrounded by at least two acres of vacant land. The man could therefore prove that he is entitled to a variance to allow him to build his daughter's home on the westerly portion of his land, but that he would not be entitled to a variance if his land were used for residential purposes.

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire. Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is possible that a third party wrongfully let the cattle out of the pen.\nB. No, because the trucker must submit direct evidence of negligence in order to invoke the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.\nC. Yes, because the farmer is strictly liable for harm caused by his escaping cattle.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nThe farmer has the burden to prove that he exercised reasonable care to prevent harm to the trucker. When the facts are as those described in this question, the farmer can meet this burden by showing that the cattle pen was a strong, secure enclosure. The farmer is not liable for harm caused by his escaping cattle under the doctrine of strict liability, because the harm was caused by the escaped animals, not by the farmer's failure to take reasonable care to prevent the animals from escaping. Because there is no strict liability in this situation, the trucker must prove that the farmer was negligent in order to recover damages. Here, the trucker has not presented sufficient evidence to meet his burden. The farmer has shown that the cattle pen was a strong, secure enclosure, which is evidence that the farmer was not negligent in keeping his cattle from escaping. Therefore, the trucker cannot invoke res ipsa loquitur and the case should be dismissed.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect. The trucker needs to establish that the farmer was in exclusive control of the pen, that the accident would not have occurred but for negligence, and that the accident was not due to the trucker\u2019s own actions.

The rupture resulted from a defect in the tire that existed at the time it was sold by the manufacturer to a retailer, who sold it to the driver and installed it on her car. The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year. After discovering this memorandum, the driver\u2019s attorney filed a timely amended complaint, adding a claim for battery. The manufacturer has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the battery claim, based on the undisputed facts set out above.

The distributor knew that an improper ratio of sand, water, and cement would result in defective concrete, but the distributor played no role in determining the ratio used by the construction company in mixing the concrete. The construction company used the concrete to form supporting columns for a building. A year later, the building collapsed during a minor earthquake, causing injury to the occupants.

Generally, this strict liability principle applies to recover damages for the foreseeable costs of curing a plaintiff's injuries or damaged property. For example, if a dog owner is strictly liable for damages resulting from his or her dog's bite, the dog bite victim may recover the cost of any necessary veterinary care to cure the victim's resulting physical injuries.

Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle. The supervisor told the dispatcher that he should quit if he couldn\u2019t handle the increased hours. Over the next three months, the dispatcher continued to complain about the working conditions, to no effect. The dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress from the working conditions, but no physical injury. He eventually was hospitalized and had to miss several months of work as a result of the emotional distress. The dispatcher sued the trucking company for negligence. The company has moved for summary judgment, based on the undisputed facts set out above. Assume that there is no applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute. How should the court rule on the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny the motion, because the jury must determine the extent of the emotional distress suffered by the dispatcher.\nB. Deny the motion, because there is evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the supervisor failed to act with ordinary care.\nC.

This is the so-called \"firefighter rule.\" The facts here are that the dispatcher suffered severe emotional distress that was proximately caused by the negligent conduct of the trucking company. The dispatcher did not suffer any accompanying physical injury. The trucking company is therefore strictly liable for damages resulting from the emotional distress.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Negligently caused emotional distress is ordinarily not actionable unless connected to a physical injury. Answer A is incorrect. Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty. As noted earlier, courts generally do not recognize a duty to take care against causing emotional distress unconnected to a physical injury. Answer D is incorrect.

The manufacturer knew that the distributor would, on the basis of the agreement, invest in an expansion of its distribution centers in State A in order to handle the distribution of the manufacturer\u2019s products to retail sellers in that state. At the time the manufacturer entered into the contract, it had already firmly decided to withdraw from the State A market in two years. Because the distributor had heard rumors of such a plan, its chief executive officer, before signing the contract, asked a representative of the manufacturer whether such a plan was in place. The representative denied the existence of any such plan. Two years into the contract, the manufacturer announced that it no longer intended to sell products in State A and canceled its contract with the distributor. The manufacturer did not thereafter supply products for distribution or sale in State A. Does the distributor have a viable fraud claim against the manufacturer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the distributor\u2019s exclusive remedy is for breach of contract.\nB. No, because the manufacturer did not misstate any material facts when entering into the contract.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\n Where a contract is made through mutual mistake, the contract is voidable. A misrepresentation made to a party to a contract can give rise to damages, but generally does not provide a basis for rescission of the contract. If the misrepresentation was made by the party to the contract in which the injured party was not a party, the injured party may be able to recover damages for negligent misrepresentation. A fraud claim may be brought by a party to a contract when the other contracting party knowingly misrepresented a material fact, resulting in a detriment to the complaining party and resulting damage to the complaining party. Generally, a fraud claim cannot be brought to avoid or rescind a contract. A claim for fraud will not be supported if the facts alleged could support a claim for negligent misrepresentation. Here, the facts support a claim for fraud because the manufacturer knew that the distributor had asked about the manufacturer's plans for the State A market when the contract was made and that the distributor had invested in the market on the basis of the contract. The manufacturer's misrepresentation that it did not have a withdrawal plan from the State A market was made with knowledge of the facts and was a material misrepresentation. The contract was made through mutual mistake. The distributor has a viable fraud claim and can recover damages for any resulting losses. The distributor cannot, however, use the claim to avoid the contract and recover the value of the contract, or to recover the value of the manufacturer's products that the distributor was required to purchase and stock.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n",

A few days after she bought the medication, because the daughter was in extreme pain, the mother gave the daughter three times the recommended dose of the medication. Thirty minutes later, because the daughter had a very rare allergy to an ingredient in the coating, she had a severe allergic reaction, for which she was hospitalized. The mother was aware of the daughter\u2019s allergy, but she did not know that the medication contained the ingredient to which the daughter was allergic. In a failure-to-warn action brought against the manufacturer of the medication, which of the arguments below would be the LEAST promising as a defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\n Where the manufacturer is sued by an injured consumer, there are two possible theories of recovery: negligence and strict liability. In a strict liability action, as in this case, the manufacturer is liable for failing to use an appropriate degree of care in the design or manufacture of the product, even if the manufacturer was not negligent. Thus, answer D is correct. Answer A is incorrect. In a failure-to-warn case, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant had a duty to warn the plaintiff of the danger involved in using the product. There is no issue here of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, so answer B is incorrect. In some failure-to-warn cases, the plaintiff will be held to the standard of conduct that the manufacturer should have used in warning the plaintiff. Here, however, the defendant had no duty to warn the mother of the ingredients in the medication, because there was no special relationship between the defendant and the mother.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",
