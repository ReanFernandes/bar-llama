The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn a suit based on a will, inheritance of $1 million depended upon whether the wife had survived her husband when both died in the crash of a small airplane. An applicable statute provided that, for purposes of distributing an estate after a common disaster, there was a rebuttable presumption that neither spouse had survived the other. A witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane she heard what she thought was a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d although by the time the two occupants were removed from the wreckage they were both dead. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.\nB. No, because the witness\u2019s testimony is too speculative to support a finding.\nC. Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.\nD.

Should the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the manager be permitted over the plaintiff\u2019s objection?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting\nthe credibility of the witness.\nB. No, because the court has not declared the manager hostile.\nC. Yes, because the cross-examiner is entitled to explore matters relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.\nD.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA state statute provides as follows: \u201cIn all criminal cases, whenever the Constitution permits, the burden of proof as to a defense claimed by the defendant shall rest on the defendant, and the magnitude of the burden shall be as great as the Constitution permits.\u201d The same state defines the crime of forcible rape as follows: \u201cForcible rape consists of sexual penetration inflicted on an unconsenting person by means of force or violence. Consent of the victim is a complete defense to a charge of rape.\u201d At a defendant\u2019s trial for forcible rape, he testified that the alleged victim had consented to having sexual intercourse with him. How should the trial judge instruct the jury regarding the issue of consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by a preponderance of the evidence, rests on the defendant.\nB. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by clear and convincing evidence, rests on the defendant.\nC. The burden of proving that the victim consented, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the defendant.\nD. The burden of proving that the victim did not consent, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the prosecution.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct because the victim's lack of consent is an affirmative defense.

Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun. The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to suppress its use as evidence. Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.\nB. Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.\nC.

Robbery is defined as taking or attempting to take something of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons using force or violence or fear. The patron's action was to take the man's wallet, which was in his pocket and that was an attempt to take something of value from him using force or violence, as the man was clearly intoxicated and unable to protect himself.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant is charged with manslaughter. At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate dismisses the charge. After a grand jury has been impaneled but before it has begun to hear evidence, the prosecutor learns of the magistrate's dismissal of the charge. The prosecutor asks the court to dismiss the grand jury. The court refuses to do so. The prosecutor then brings the case before the grand jury. Should the grand jury's subsequent indictment be set aside if it is discovered after the indictment that the grand jury had been improperly impaneled?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the grand jury has already returned an indictment.\nB. Yes, because the grand jury has no jurisdiction to act after the court has refused to dismiss it.\nC. Yes, because the prosecutor's failure to comply with a court order deprived the grand jury of due process.\nD. No, because the failure to obey a court order does not, in itself, render an indictment invalid.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct because the grand jury has no jurisdiction to act after the court has refused to dismiss it. The grand jury's jurisdiction is limited to determining whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, and that a person has committed it. After the court has refused to dismiss the grand jury, the grand jury has no power to act.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n A defendant and a group of his friends are on trial for extorting $10,000 from a victim.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

As soon as the undercover officer handed over the heroin, other officers moved in and arrested the dealer. The jurisdiction follows the common law approach to conspiracy. Could the dealer properly be convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because there was no overt act.\nB. No, because there was no plurality of agreement.\nC. Yes, because neither an overt act nor plurality of agreement is required at common law.\nD.

An agreement among two or more people to commit a crime is necessary to sustain a conviction for conspiracy. The dealer was not present when the undercover officer purchased the heroin.

The diplomat became friendly with a woman in a bar who he believed was small enough to crawl through the air vent. Without telling her that he was a diplomat, he explained how she could get into the jewelry store. She agreed to help him burglarize the store. Someone overheard their conversation and reported it to the police. Shortly thereafter, the police arrested the diplomat and the woman. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. Before trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity. The court granted his motion. The woman then moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her. The jurisdiction has adopted the Model Penal Code version of conspiracy. Should the woman\u2019s motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the diplomat\u2019s defense does not negate any element of the crime.\nB. No, because the woman was not aware of the diplomat\u2019s status.\nC. Yes, because a conspiracy requires two guilty participants.\nD.

Diplomatic immunity is clearly relevant to this claim because the diplomat's conduct is being compared to the woman's conduct. The woman's conduct is not immune from prosecution. B is incorrect because The woman was not aware that the diplomat was a diplomat and was not thus aware that his conduct was immune from prosecution. C is incorrect because A conspiracy requires the presence of two participants. The diplomat was not a participant in this conspiracy.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The store owner responded that he would charge extra because the woman was so unwise as to confide her unlawful plans for using the weapon, and he sold her a handgun at four times the regular price. During the robbery, the woman used the gun to threaten a bank teller into handing over the money. The gun discharged by accident and killed a bank customer. At common law, who in addition to the woman could properly be convicted of murder in the death of the customer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the friend and the store owner.\nB.

The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization\u2019s request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization\u2019s placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator\u2019s decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the administrator\u2019s denial of space to the organization was a reasonable time, manner, and place\nrestriction of speech.\nB.

The callers warned of the risks of not obtaining prompt medical evaluation to detect injuries resulting from accidents and offered free examinations to determine whether the victims had suffered any injuries. In response to these complaints, the legislature enacted a law prohibiting medical care providers from soliciting any accident victim by telephone within 30 days of his or her accident. Which of the following is the most useful argument for the state to use in defending the constitutionality of the law?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Because the commercial speech that is the subject of this law includes some speech that is misleading, the First\nAmendment does not limit the power of the state to regulate that speech.\nB. Because the law regulates only commercial speech, the state need only demonstrate that the restriction is rationally\nrelated to achieving the state\u2019s legitimate interests in protecting the privacy of accident victims and in regulating the\nmedical profession.\nC. The state has substantial interests in protecting the privacy of accident victims and in regulating the practice of\nmedical care providers, and the law is narrowly tailored to achieve the state\u2019s objectives.\nD. The law is a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The state has a compelling interest in protecting the privacy of accident victims. The victims have a diminished expectation of privacy with regard to telephone conversations because they are often made in circumstances that may make the person making the call difficult to understand or understandable only by those with knowledge of the circumstances. The callers are often seeking to influence the victim to use their medical care services, which would be to the caller's economic advantage. Thus, the state has a compelling interest in preventing misleading and aggressive telephone calls by medical care providers to accident victims. The First Amendment does not limit the state's power to regulate commercial speech as long as the regulation is within the scope of the government's authority to regulate commercial speech and is substantially related to an important interest. The state's interest in protecting the privacy of accident victims is important and substantial. Because the law at issue here is a regulation of commercial speech, the state need only show that the law is substantially related to the state's important interest in protecting the privacy of accident victims. The law is not an outright ban on all telephone calls by medical care providers to accident victims, but simply a ban on calls within 30 days of an accident that are intended to influence the victim's decision to use the caller's medical care services. That is a substantial fit with the state's interest in protecting the privacy of accident victims.\n",

The victim is prepared to identify the caller by his voice, but he does not know the caller's phone number. The victim's testimony at the preliminary hearing was as follows: Q: What did this man say? A: He said, \"Give me $50,000, or I'll go to the police and tell them about your daughter.\" The victim's daughter had been kidnapped and held for ransom two months before the extortion call. The victim's daughter was rescued by the police after the victim's payment of $50,000. The victim's daughter had been missing for five days before the extortion call. The victim's daughter was not with the caller. The victim's testimony at the preliminary hearing was prompted by this question: Q: What is the identity of the person who made this telephone call? A: The caller identified himself as \"Bob Smith.\" The caller used a pay telephone. The victim's deposition testimony was as follows: Q: State your name. A: John Smith. Q: Where do you reside? A: 123 Elm Street, Anytown, USA. Q: What is your occupation? A: I am a self-employed plumber.

Recently, the landowner built an eight-foot chain-link fence, topped by three strands of barbed wire, across a gully on her land that provided the only access to the area frequented by the deer. A wildlife photographer asked the landowner for permission to enter the property to photograph the deer. Because the landowner feared that any publicity would encourage further intrusions, she denied the photographer\u2019s request. Frustrated, the photographer attempted to climb the fence. He became entangled in the barbed wire and suffered extensive lacerations. The wounds became infected and ultimately caused his death. The photographer\u2019s personal representative brought an action against the landowner. Will the plaintiff prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

In an action by the hiker against the property owner to recover for his head injury, will the hiker prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the property owner could not foresee that anyone would be injured.\nB. No, because the property owner breached no duty to the hiker, who was a trespasser.\nC.

In fact, the car looked almost exactly like the very unusually marked one driven by a famous and popular driver. The driver in the ad was not identified, and his face was not shown in the advertisement. The cigarette maker published the advertisement without obtaining the famous driver\u2019s permission.

Will the cigarette maker\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because there are sufficient indicia of the driver\u2019s identity to support a verdict of liability.\nB. Yes, because the driver is a public figure.\nC. Yes, because there was no mention of the driver\u2019s name in the ad.\nD. Yes, because the driver did not claim any emotional or dignitary loss.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The cigarette maker's use of the race-car driver's likeness is a clear use of the driver's identity to promote a commercial product, the cigarette brand.

Soon after the purchase, the consumer was using the blender in an appropriate way when the blender jar shattered, throwing a piece of glass into the consumer\u2019s eye. The consumer brought an action against the manufacturer based solely on strict product liability. The consumer\u2019s expert testified that the blender was defectively designed. However, because the blender jar was destroyed in the accident, the expert could not determine whether the accident was caused by the design defect or a manufacturing defect. The manufacturer\u2019s expert testified that the blender was not defective. If, at the conclusion of the evidence, both parties move for directed verdicts, how should the trial judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Direct a verdict for the manufacturer, because the consumer\u2019s expert was unable to specify the nature of the defect.\nB. Direct a verdict for the manufacturer, because the consumer\u2019s action was brought solely on a strict liability theory.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProducts_liability\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nA is incorrect. Strict liability applies to all three theories of liability--negligence, strict liability, and strict products liability--and, thus, a claim brought under strict products liability will be analyzed under the strict products liability standard. B is incorrect. A claim brought under a strict products liability theory will be successful if the court finds that the product was defective and that the defect caused the injury. The expert testimony is not sufficient to establish a defect; the consumer must also present some other evidence to establish a defect. Here, the expert's opinion is that the blender is defectively designed, but there is no other evidence of a design defect. C is incorrect. The action was brought against the manufacturer, not against the consumer. The fact that the consumer was using the blender as it was intended to be used is not relevant to whether the blender was defective. D is correct. A jury could find that the blender was defective because the blender jar shattered when the consumer was using it properly, which led to the glass piece that injured the consumer's eye. The presence of a design defect could cause a blender jar to shatter when the jar is used properly.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA widow and a widower were joint owners of property in fee simple.

The contract between the food company and the delivery service was terminable at will. The delivery service then entered into a contract with an airline company to provide an airplane to deliver the food. The contract between the delivery service and the airline company was also terminable at will. The food company was displeased with the airline company because of a previous business dispute between them. Upon learning of the delivery service\u2019s contract with the airline company, the food company terminated its contract with the delivery service in order to cause the airline company to lose the business. When the food company terminated the delivery service\u2019s contract, the delivery service had no choice but to terminate the airline company\u2019s contract. If the airline company sues the delivery service for tortious interference with contract, will the airline company prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the airline company and the delivery service were the parties to the contract.\nB. No, because the airline company was not in privity with the food company.\nC. Yes, because the delivery service did not terminate the contract because of poor performance.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A is incorrect. Because the airline company and the delivery service were the parties to the contract, the airline company must prove that the delivery service was negligent in terminating the contract. The delivery service's decision to terminate the contract was a tortious interference with the airline company's contract with the delivery service. The airline company is not in privity with the food company; the food company and the delivery service were. C is incorrect. The delivery service's termination of the contract was not prompted by the airline company's failure to perform. The delivery service's reason for terminating the contract was that the food company had terminated its contract with the delivery service. D is incorrect. The delivery service's termination of the contract with the airline company made the delivery service a joint tortfeasor with the food company, but that does not make the delivery service a proximate or legal cause of the airline company's injury. The food company's conduct was the proximate cause of the airline company's injury.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA woman frequently visited a man who lived in the house next to her.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nReal_property\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A is incorrect. The man used the property as his residence, not as an investment. B is incorrect. The man did not exercise an equitable right of redemption. A mortgage holder has an equitable right to redeem a mortgaged property after foreclosure if the mortgage holder's failure to timely pay the mortgage debt was not willful. The man's failure to pay the mortgage was willful, because he was in default on the loan when the foreclosure sale was conducted. C is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration relieves a person who has a right, title, and interest in property of liability for a tort committed by that person on the property if the person is not negligent in bringing about the circumstances that created the need for a recovery pursuant to that right, title, and interest. The man has no right, title, or interest in the property.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant is on trial for extorting $100,000 from a victim.

The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her. After the farmer promptly and properly recorded that deed, the second bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the farm. The farmer denied the validity of the second bank\u2019s mortgage. Does the second bank continue to have a valid mortgage on the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of estoppel by deed.\nB.

The contract stipulated that the seller would deliver to the buyer, upon the payment of the last installment due, \u201ca warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\u201d The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The buyer entered into possession of the land. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the buyer discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on the land, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25 percent of the purchase price that the buyer had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the seller had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the seller. The value of the land was then four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller\u2019s alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the buyer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nB.

Because the seller is the owner of the property in fee simple, he has an absolute right to convey a fee simple. That, combined with the seller's failure to convey marketable title and that the buyer has made 10 of the 300 payments obligated under the contract, all are clear indications that the seller is not able to convey marketable title to the buyer.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nSix years ago, a landlord and a tenant entered into a 10-year commercial lease of land. The written lease provided that, if a public entity under the power of eminent domain condemned any part of the land, the lease would terminate and the landlord would receive the entire condemnation award. Thereafter, the city condemned approximately two-thirds of the land. The tenant notified the city and the landlord that an independent appraisal of the value of the tenant\u2019s possessory interest established that it substantially exceeded the tenant\u2019s obligation under the lease and that the tenant was entitled to share the award. The appraisal was accurate. In an appropriate action among the landlord, the tenant, and the city as to the right of the tenant to a portion of the condemnation award, for whom will the court likely find?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landlord, because the condemnation superseded and canceled the lease.\nB. The landlord, because the parties specifically agreed as to the consequences of condemnation.\nC. The tenant, because the landlord breached the landlord\u2019s implied warranty of quiet enjoyment.\nD. The tenant, because otherwise the landlord would be unjustly enriched.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The price was paid, the warranty deed was delivered, and the deed was promptly and properly recorded. Neither the niece nor the colleague had, at that point, ever seen the land. After recording the deed, the colleague visited the land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to any public right-of-way and that none of the surrounding lands had ever been held in common ownership with any previous owner of the tract of land. The colleague sued the niece for damages. For whom will the court find?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The colleague, because lack of access makes title unmarketable.\nB. The colleague, because the covenants of warranty and quiet enjoyment in the deed were breached.\nC. The niece, because no title covenants were breached.\nD.

Fifteen years ago, after a part of the path located on his land and connecting his cabin to the public highway washed out, the man cleared a small part of his neighbor\u2019s land and rerouted a section of the path through the neighbor\u2019s land. Twelve years ago, the neighbor leased her land to some hunters. For the next 12 years, the hunters and the man who had rerouted the path used the path for access to the highway.

The neighbor told the man that she had not given him permission to cross her land and that she would be closing the rerouted path after 90 days. The man\u2019s land and the neighbor\u2019s land have never been in common ownership. The period of time necessary to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is 10 years.

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \u201cIt is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\u201d Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor\u2019s intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor\u2019s proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owners of lots in the subdivision own property benefitted by the original residential covenant and\nhave the sole right to enforce it.\nB. No, because the man owns property benefitted by the original restrictive covenant and has a right to enforce it.\nC.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nFive years ago, an investor who owned a vacant lot in a residential area borrowed $25,000 from a friend and gave the friend a note for $25,000 due in five years, secured by a mortgage on the lot. The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000. The buyer knew nothing of the friend\u2019s mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot. Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her bank of the mortgage claimed by the investor\u2019s friend, the bank loaned her $15,000, and she gave the bank a note for $15,000 due in two years secured by a mortgage on the lot. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. At that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cNo conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\u201d Both notes are now due and both the investor and the buyer have refused to pay. The lot is now worth only $50,000. What are the rights of the investor\u2019s friend and the bank in the lot?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both mortgages are enforceable liens and the friend\u2019s has priority because it was first recorded.\nB. Both mortgages are enforceable liens, but the bank\u2019s has priority because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for\nvalue.\nC. Only the friend\u2019s mortgage is an enforceable lien, because the bank had actual and constructive notice of the\ninvestor\u2019s fraud.\nD. Only the bank\u2019s mortgage is an enforceable lien, because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for value.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nReal_property\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The investor was the owner of the property and thus was the person whose conduct could create an issue of fraudulent conveyance. The buyer was an \"innocent purchaser for value\" because she was not aware of the investor's mortgage, and thus could not have intended to or knowingly triggered the investor's friend's obligation to record the mortgage. That, combined with the fact that the bank had actual and constructive notice of the investor's fraud (since they did not record the mortgage, and that the bank was therefore taking a risk by loaning the buyer money to purchase the property), leads to an inference that the bank was an \"innocent\" lender, as it had no knowledge of the investor's friend's claim to the property. That, combined with the priority of the mortgage over the debt in question (since it was created first, and thus has priority under the recording statute), leads to an answer choice of B.\n",

The friend, however, did not record the mortgage. The investor then sold the lot to the buyer. The buyer had no actual notice of the mortgage to the friend. The buyer had no notice based on possession because the lot was vacant. The buyer had no constructive notice of the mortgage because the mortgage to the friend had not been recorded when the buyer received title. The lot is located in a notice jurisdiction. Thus, the buyer took the lot free of any prior unrecorded documents. The buyer was an innocent purchaser for value at the time the buyer received title.

The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee\u2019s will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. The grantee\u2019s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might\nhave.\nC. The two tracts of land were not adjacent parcels of real estate, and thus the right to purchase is in gross and is\ntherefore unenforceable.\nD.

            "explanation": "Fifteen years ago each of the parties granted a reciprocal right of first refusal (or a preemptive right) to the other. A right of first refusal is a conditional option. It provides that if the owner ever decides to sell the property, the one holding the right of first refusal has the right to purchase it. In this case, the price for the purchase was to be set by three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers and was thus fair. The right, however, violates the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. The right to purchase is triggered by the decision of one to sell his or her land. In this case, that decision might occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the right was granted. Thus, under the common law, the right of first refusal is struck ab initio. The question notes that the common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in this jurisdiction.

The homeowner told the contractor to stop working immediately. The reasonable market value of the labor and materials provided by the contractor at that point, including the oak flooring, was $40,000. The contractor used the $5,000 worth of oak flooring on another job. In an action by the contractor against the homeowner for damages, which of the following would be the largest amount of damages recoverable by the contractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $40,000, the reasonable value of the services the contractor had provided.\nB. $40,000, the contractor\u2019s construction costs.\nC. $50,000, the contractor\u2019s construction costs of $45,000 plus the $10,000 profit minus the $5,000 saved by reusing the\noak flooring on another job.\nD. $55,000, the contractor\u2019s construction costs of $45,000 plus the $10,000 profit.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nOn March 1, a homeowner contacted a builder about constructing an addition to the homeowner\u2019s house. The builder orally offered to perform the work for $200,000 if his pending bid on another project was rejected. The homeowner accepted the builder\u2019s terms and the builder then prepared a written contract that both parties signed. The contract did not refer to the builder\u2019s pending bid. One week later, upon learning that his pending bid on the other project had been accepted, the builder refused to perform any work for the homeowner. Can the homeowner recover for the builder\u2019s nonperformance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because efficiency principles justify the builder\u2019s services being directed to a higher-valued use.\nB. No, because the builder\u2019s duty to perform was subject to a condition.\nC. Yes, because the builder\u2019s attempt to condition his duty to perform rendered the contract illusory.\nD. Yes, because the parol evidence rule would bar the builder from presenting evidence of oral understandings not\nincluded in the final writing.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

A condition precedent will not be sufficient to avoid performance if it is not performed. The builder's failure to perform his obligations under the contract was caused by his failure to perform his contractual obligation to use his best efforts to obtain the homeowner's business. The builder's failure to use his best efforts to obtain the homeowner's business was a failure to perform a condition precedent.\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant is charged with manslaughter. At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate dismissed the charge because the evidence was insufficient. The prosecutor brought the case before a grand jury, and the grand jury refused to return an indictment. The prosecutor then brought the case before a grand jury in another county, which returned an indictment charging the defendant with manslaughter. The defendant has moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. Should the motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because jeopardy had not attached.\nB. No, because the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar prosecutions brought in compliance with state law.\nC. Yes, because the prosecution was barred by the Constitution's Double Jeopardy Clause.\nD.

The collector has as much as $120,000 in his possession that he is prepared to pay.

Does the contractor have valid legal grounds to cancel the contract with the excavator and hire a replacement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the excavator committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract by causing the contractor to feel\ninsecure about the performance.\nB. Yes, because the excavator breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nC.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAn accountant and a bookkeeper, as part of a contract dissolving their accounting business, agreed that each would contribute $100,000 to fund an annuity for a clerk who was a longtime employee of the business. The clerk\u2019s position would be terminated due to the dissolution, and he did not have a retirement plan. The accountant and the bookkeeper informed the clerk of their plan to fund an annuity for him. The clerk, confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity, purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100,000 to fund the annuity, but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50,000. The accountant agreed that the bookkeeper should contribute only $50,000. Does the clerk have a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the clerk was bound by the modification of the agreement made by the accountant and the bookkeeper.\nB. No, because the clerk was only a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper, and\nhad no vested rights.\nC. Yes, because the clerk\u2019s reliance on the promised retirement fund prevented the parties from changing the terms.\nD. Yes, because the promises to establish the fund were made binding by consideration from the clerk\u2019s many years of\nemployment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

On March 2, the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer\u2019s order was for a rush job, the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day\u2019s delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25,000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25,000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5,000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid, which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic\u2019s best defense to the textile company\u2019s action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Time was not of the essence in the contract between the mechanic and the textile company.\nB. The mechanic had no reason to foresee on March 1 that the customer would suffer consequential damages in the\namount of $25,000.\nC. By entering into the contract with the customer while knowing that its knitting machine was being repaired, the textile\ncompany assumed the risk of any delay loss to the customer.\nD.
