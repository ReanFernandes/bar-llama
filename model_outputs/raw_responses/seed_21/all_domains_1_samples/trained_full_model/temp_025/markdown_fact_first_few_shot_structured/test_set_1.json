            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The complaint set out the bank\u2019s method of calculating interest and alleged that the method violated both federal banking law and state contract law. The bank filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that its method of calculating interest, as described in the complaint, was proper under federal law and that the federal law preempted the depositor\u2019s state-law claim. The court granted the motion to dismiss the depositor\u2019s federal claim and reserved ruling on the motion to dismiss the state-law claim. After completing discovery, the bank has moved to dismiss the state-law claim for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect.

The defendant failed to return the signed waiver request, answer, or otherwise plead within 60 days, prompting the plaintiff to move for default. The plaintiff did not file proof of service, but the question focuses on the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s response.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder federal civil procedure, a defendant has 60 days to respond to a complaint in a federal diversity action. If the defendant fails to do so, the court may enter a default judgment. In this scenario, the defendant\u2019s failure to respond within the allotted time frame makes default appropriate. However, the question focuses on the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s response, not the plaintiff\u2019s failure to file proof of service.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the defendant failed to respond within the 60-day deadline, default judgment is appropriate. However, the question asks about the likelihood of the court granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion to enter default, considering that the plaintiff did not file proof of service.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Although a request for waiver of service was sent, the defendant was not obligated to and did not respond to the request. Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

In this scenario, the relevant factor is the convenience of the court, specifically the convenience of the judicial forum. Given that the action involves multiple passengers who were injured when the train derailed in State B and the railroad is incorporated and has its principal place of business in State B, the court should consider the convenience of the State B federal court.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the railroad is seeking to transfer the action to the State B federal court based on forum non conveniens, the court should consider the convenience of the judicial forum.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

With the complaint, the US Attorney moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to \u201cenjoin any blockade of the base\u2019s entrance or other disruption of base activity until the court can hear motions for a preliminary and a permanent injunction.\u201d The US Attorney attached an affidavit certifying the unsuccessful efforts she had made to locate the organization and its leader and to notify them of the motion.

The appointment was made on the basis of the woman's reputation as a civic leader and her expertise in governmental affairs. The appointment was not made on the basis of any promise or understanding that the woman would be considered for the position of state attorney general when the office became vacant. In 1997, the governor resigned and was appointed to head a federal agency. The governor thereupon appointed a new state attorney general. Later that year, the woman brought an action against the governor and the new attorney general, alleging that the governor had breached his fiduciary duty to her by failing to disclose his intention to leave state government when he was appointed to the federal agency and by failing to make reasonable efforts to prevent the new attorney general from being appointed. The woman further alleged that the new attorney general had jointly breached his fiduciary duty to her by failing to prevent the governor from making the appointment. The woman sought damages for breach of fiduciary duty. The case was tried before a jury. On a question of joint liability, the jury should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. return a verdict in favor of the woman, because the new attorney general was a joint tortfeasor with the governor.\nB. return a verdict in favor of the new attorney general, because the new attorney general was not involved in the governor's decision to make the appointment.\nC. return a verdict in favor of the woman, because the new attorney general was involved in the governor",

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC.

The complaint alleged that the fire had been caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the house\u2019s electrical system in accordance with the applicable housing code. The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent. In opposition to that motion, the tenant argues that under federal law, contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that a defendant who wishes to assert the defense must plead in an answer or other responsive pleading. Which law governs how the court should rule on the motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Federal law, because the burden of pleading on a motion to dismiss in federal court is substantive, not procedural.\nB. Federal law, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control pleading in federal court.\nC. State law, because the application of federal law would be outcome-determinative.\nD.

The tenant is arguing that federal law governs how the court should decide the motion, specifically that the landlord must plead the affirmative defense of contributory negligence.\n\n### Rule application\nIn determining the question of what law governs how the court should decide a motion to dismiss in federal court, the relevant legal principle is the choice of law rules in federal court. Under those rules, the applicable law is determined by the relevant facts in the case and the domain of the legal concept at issue. In this scenario, the relevant facts are that the tenant is suing the landlord in federal court based on a state-law negligence claim, and the legal concept is the preliminary question of what law governs how the court should decide a motion to dismiss. Therefore, the relevant domain is constitutional law, as the question of choice of law in federal court is governed by constitutional principles.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the question of choice of law in federal court is governed by constitutional principles, the correct verdict would be determined by considering the relevant domains and domains within constitutional law.

The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect.

In this scenario, the governor is being detained by federal authorities under a valid federal arrest warrant, but a state judge is seeking to challenge his detention on federal constitutional grounds.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the governor is being detained by federal authorities under a valid federal arrest warrant, the state judge's attempt to use habeas corpus to challenge his detention on federal constitutional grounds is unlikely to succeed.

Congress can use its commerce power to regulate economic activity, such as manufacturing and production of articles for interstate commerce, that is not itself a commercial transaction. In addition, Gonzales v. Raich holds that Congress can incidentally regulate noncommercial activities in order to effectuate regulations of related commercial activities. Answer C is incorrect. While stoves and fuels may have previously moved in interstate commerce, they are not themselves channels or instrumentalities of commerce. Answer D is incorrect. United States v. Lopez holds that the aggregate effects test applies only to regulations of economic activity.",

The statute authorizes the President to appoint the agency\u2019s director with the advice and consent of the Senate and prohibits the President from removing the director without the Senate\u2019s consent. The President appointed a director, and the Senate confirmed the appointment. Recently, the President has become dissatisfied with the director\u2019s strict approach to drug-law enforcement and wishes to remove the director. Because a majority of senators favor strict drug-law enforcement, the Senate has refused to consent to the director\u2019s removal. May the President constitutionally remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director\u2019s appointment and removal.\nB. No, because the President\u2019s removal of principal officers of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\nC.

However, the president has since become dissatisfied with the director's performance and seeks to remove him, despite the Senate's refusal to provide consent.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder the separation of powers doctrine, the executive branch is responsible for carrying out the laws established by Congress, and the president has the power to appoint and remove executive branch officials. However, this power is subject to certain limitations, including the requirement of Senate confirmation for most high-level appointments. In this scenario, the president's attempt to remove the director without the Senate's consent would likely be considered a violation of this requirement.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the president appointed the director with the advice and consent of the Senate, he is generally bound by that decision unless the Senate consents to his removal. In this scenario, the Senate has refused to consent to the director's removal, making the president's attempt to remove him without their consent unconstitutional.

The fee for registration is nominal, and the commission has no discretion to deny a permit to a carrier that properly registers and pays the registration fee. Are the state\u2019s requirements constitutional when applied to a wholly interstate carrier?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because neither a carrier\u2019s registration nor its payment of a nominal fee is necessary to facilitate the application of state laws to motor carriers.\nB. No, because the requirements impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the requirements apply equally to interstate and intrastate carriers and are the only prerequisites to the issuance of the permit.\nD.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.

The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children.

While it is true that a \u201clifetime\u201d employment agreement is not subject to the statute of frauds, when the parties fail to expressly agree to an essential term in a contract, there is no requirement that they negotiate for agreement on that term in good faith. Answer D is incorrect. A \u201clifetime\u201d employment agreement does not fall within the statute of frauds, so the confirmation letter is not necessary to enforce any contract formed. But the parties do not have a binding contract, because they have not agreed on an essential term\u2014the executive\u2019s salary.",

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC.

When the contract was reduced to writing, the price-escalation clause was omitted, but both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. The contractor later seeks to recover the additional cost of lumber based on the original verbal agreement, but the landowner refuses, arguing that the contract is unenforceable due to mutual mistake.\n\n### Rule application\nConsideration in contract law allows a party to recover damages if the other party fails to fulfill their obligations under the contract. In this scenario, the contractor is seeking to recover the additional cost of lumber based on the original verbal agreement. However, mutual mistake in the formation of a contract prevents a party from recovering damages if both parties are mistaken as to a material fact at the time of contracting. In this scenario, both parties were mistaken as to the inclusion of the price-escalation clause in the written contract, making the contract unenforceable.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that both parties were mistaken as to the inclusion of the price-escalation clause in the written contract, the contract would be unenforceable under the doctrine of mutual mistake in contract formation.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

The parties also orally agreed that if the services required in any given month exceeded 100 hours, the landlord would pay the company a discounted hourly rate of $125 per hour for those extra services. When the parties put their agreement in writing, however, neither party noticed that the contract did not include the discounted-rate provision. In a recent month, because of several snowstorms, the services needed by the landlord exceeded 100 hours. The landlord has reminded the company that services in excess of 100 hours are to be paid at the discounted rate, but the company insists that it be paid at the contract rate of $150 per hour. Which of the following best describes the legal relationship between the parties at this point?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The parties\u2019 contract is void ab initio because of the indefiniteness of the price term.\nB. The parties have a valid, enforceable contract that will be reformed to reflect the discounted rate of $125 per hour for services in excess of 100 hours.\nC.

The landlord later notified the company of the oral agreement regarding the discounted rate, but the company refused to honor it.\n\n### Rule application\nWhen interpreting a contract, courts will consider the relevant factors to determine the parties' intent, including the language used, the circumstances under which the contract was made, and the parties' prior dealings. In this scenario, the relevant factor is the parties' mutual mistake regarding the discounted rate.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the parties were mistaken when they entered into the written contract, without considering the discounted rate, the correct verdict would be based on contractual interpretation.

The father died, and his daughter has since refused to pay anything to either the nephew or the neighbor. The neighbor has sued the daughter for the $50,000. Is the neighbor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter did not consent to any modification of the contract she had made with her father.\nB.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB.

The customer and the range owner would each be found to be 25% at fault for failing to prevent him from entering the shooting range while they were both shooting towards a target. The manufacturer would be found to be 25% at fault for designing a signaling system that did not provide adequate warning.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the man's degree of fault is less than that of the customer and the range owner, he would be able to recover damages from each based on joint and several liability. However, considering that the customer and the range owner are both equally at fault, the man would be able to recover 25% of his damages from each, totaling 50% from each defendant.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The buyer intentionally shoved the employee, which satisfies the prima facie case for battery. As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

A conclusion that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous, combined with the fact that the woman experienced severe emotional distress and the fact that the debt collector was probably at least reckless with respect to the risk of causing her distress, will provide the woman with a plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim. Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman\u2019s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.   Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. Answer C is incorrect. A mere failure to comply with industry custom does not establish any of the elements of IIED.",

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying. Here, the defendant\u2019s purpose for his wrongful conduct (killing the declarant) was revenge for a theft and not a desire to prevent trial testimony. Therefore, the prosecutor cannot make the showing of intent required for forfeiture of either objection. Answers A and B are incorrect for the reasons set out above.   Answer D is incorrect. The federal courts have held that a trial judge may find the threshold requirements for forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. Further, the preponderance standard applies to the trial judge\u2019s determinations on preliminary questions of admissibility under FRE 104(a).",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The defense attorney should have immediately objected when the witness related inadmissible hearsay. An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103. In addition, the delayed objection failed to preserve the right to appeal, because the defense attorney did not state a specific basis for the objection under FRE 103. Answer A is incorrect. Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103. Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect.

The defense may offer extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for the limited non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness after the witness has been given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Answer A is incorrect. The witness\u2019s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose. And since there is no applicable hearsay exception for the witness\u2019s statement to the investigator, it cannot be admitted to prove that the plaintiff did not fall.",

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

The defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that he lacked notice of the bankruptcy. The plaintiff seeks to introduce a newspaper article to establish that the defendant received notice of the bankruptcy. The defendant objects on the grounds of hearsay and lack of proper authentication.\n\n### Rule application\nThe hearsay exception for past recollection recorded allows a witness to testify about a statement made by another person if the witness heard the statement while the person making it was remembering the event and the witness made a record of the statement reasonably promptly after the event. In this scenario, the plaintiff seeks to introduce a newspaper article to establish that the defendant received notice of the bankruptcy, supporting the use of the past recollection recorded exception.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the plaintiff seeks to establish the defendant's notice of the bankruptcy through a newspaper article, the correct verdict would be based on the hearsay exception for past recollection recorded.

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect. Because the newspaper story is not offered for its truth, but rather to demonstrate notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy, it is not hearsay, and no hearsay exception is required for its admission.

Each conveyance was by a deed of gift containing a covenant specifying that only one single-story home could be constructed on the conveyed lot in order to preserve views of a nearby lake from the mother\u2019s lot. The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot.

Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, since she herself constructed a three-story house.\nB. No, because there was no consideration given for the covenants in the deeds of gift.\nC.

When the mother subsequently built a three-story house on her lot, the covenant was breached, but the purchaser was not bound because she did not receive sufficient consideration to form a valid contract.\n\n### Rule application\nConsideration is a bargained-for exchange of value between the parties to a contract, and in this scenario, the mother and son each provided a valid promise to the other to use the land for a single-story residence.

Lastly, they agreed that during the 10-year period the woman could live on the land. The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her. The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB.

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect.

When the man learned of the buyer's ownership, he blocked the easement with a fence.\n\n### Rule application\nAn appurtenant easement is a nonpossessory interest in land that runs with the land and is limited to the benefit of the fee owner. In contrast, an easement in gross is a nonpossessory interest in land that is not tied to the fee and may be held by anyone. In this scenario, the man's conveyance of an easement to the woman was appurtenant because it was intended to benefit her as the fee owner of the land. Therefore, the correct verdict would be based on the appurtenant versus in gross distinction, supporting option A.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the man conveyed an appurtenant easement to the woman, who then sold her interest in the land, the easement should have passed to the buyer as the fee owner.

The buyer discovered the covenant after the contract was made and attempted to rescind based on the seller's failure to deliver marketable title.\n\n### Rule application\nRescission allows a party to cancel a contract if the other party fails to perform their obligations under the contract.

The mortgage was promptly recorded. Six months later, the bank assigned only the promissory note to an investor. The assignment made no express reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The bank immediately sent the buyer a notice of the assignment, which provided the address of the investor and explained that the bank was no longer servicing the loan. The buyer made timely payments to the investor for two years but then defaulted on the loan. After the buyer failed to cure the default, the investor accelerated the debt and commenced a foreclosure action. The buyer\u2019s defense in the foreclosure action is that the investor is not the mortgagee and therefore has no right to foreclose.

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled. Answer D is incorrect because the woman did embezzle $100,000; see the explanation for answer B.",

On the facts described, a jury could potentially conclude that the woman did not act with the sort of aggravated recklessness necessary to constitute depraved-heart homicide or extreme-indifference murder, even though she was intoxicated and driving in an unlawful manner. Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself. Even if understood as the offense of \u201cpublic intoxication,\u201d this offense would be a poor choice because public intoxication is not a lesser included offense of murder.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

After some discussion in which the man expressed his extreme anger at his ex-wife, the man offered the officer $5,000 to kill her. The officer agreed and made arrangements to meet the man at the bar the next day to collect the $5,000 payment. When the man showed up the next day at the bar, authorities immediately arrested him. The jurisdiction defines attempt, solicitation, and misprision of a felony as at common law, and also punishes bilateral conspiracies. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness.

The appointment was made on the basis of the woman's demonstrated competence and integrity. In 2003, the governor learned that the woman had been arrested and charged with forgery. The charge related to a check the woman had written on her personal account. The check was payable to a friend who lived with the woman but was not related to her. The friend had been staying with the woman because the woman was going through a separation and divorce proceeding with her husband. Late one night, while the friend was sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom, the husband burst through the door and told the woman, \"Get out.\" When the woman refused, the husband challenged her to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The woman again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the woman. The woman grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The woman is charged with murder.

Answer A is incorrect because the facts do not show that the man took sufficient steps toward completing a murder. The man did nothing but offer to pay, and this conduct is not \u201cdangerously proximate\u201d to the commission of the offense as required by the common law. Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony. Additionally, the facts do not establish a misprision. That offense   occurs when a person fails to inform the authorities about a felony that the person knows about.",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nSelf-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside. When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant was arrested and charged with burglary. Under state law, police are required to obtain DNA samples from all persons arrested for felonies and to store those samples in a state registry. The police informed the defendant of the state law and said that they would be using a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample from him. The defendant did not object. The defendant was later acquitted of burglary. A year later, however, authorities matched the defendant\u2019s DNA to an unsolved sexual assault crime. The defendant, now charged with sexual assault, has moved to suppress the DNA sample as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court suppress the DNA sample?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant failed to lodge a timely objection to the sample collection.\nB. No, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nC. No, because the statute violates the Fourth Amendment, but the police acted in good-faith reliance upon it.\nD. Yes, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees violates the Fourth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The police notified him of the law and used a cheek swab to collect the sample. The defendant did not object at the time. A year later, the defendant was charged with a separate crime based on DNA evidence found at the scene. The defendant argues that the search should be excluded because the statute is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n### Rule application\nGood-faith reliance allows an officer to rely on the reasonableness of a search or seizure made prior to the exclusionary rule\u2019s establishment in Miranda v. Arizona, even if the search or seizure later proves unconstitutional. In this scenario, the defendant was arrested and required to provide a DNA sample under a valid state law. The police notified him of the law and used a cheek swab to collect the sample, which was considered a reasonable search under the circumstances. Therefore, the officer acted in good faith based on the validity of the search at the time it was conducted.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the defendant was arrested and required to provide a DNA sample under a valid state law, the officer acted within the bounds of good-faith reliance.

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Yes, because defense counsel is required to present any known mitigating factors in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

After exhausting state remedies, he filed a federal habeas corpus petition, arguing that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing during the penalty phase of the trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n### Rule application\nThe standard of prejudice in ineffective assistance of counsel is a strict one, particularly in the context of capital punishment. In this scenario, the defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if counsel had presented mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence of the defendant\u2019s sordid upbringing during the penalty phase of the trial likely resulted in a more severe sentence, the defendant has met the high burden of establishing prejudice. Therefore, the correct verdict would be based on a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different if counsel had presented mitigating evidence, supporting option C.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n[/INST]\nQuestion:\n  In 1991, a woman was appointed to a state agency by the governor. The woman had been a member of the governor's campaign committee and had made substantial contributions to the governor's election campaign. The woman was appointed to a term that would expire in 1995. In 1993, the governor was indicted for accepting bribes. The woman was notified by the state that the governor had been impeached and that her appointment would be terminated. The woman sued the governor and the state, claiming that the governor's impeachment and disqualification from holding public office invalidated her appointment. The woman's suit should be decided by\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the United States Supreme Court, because the question of the validity of the woman's appointment is a federal question.\nB. the state supreme court, because the question of the validity of the woman's appointment is a state question.\nC. the United States Supreme Court, because the woman has standing to raise the question.\nD. the state supreme court, because the woman was not appointed by the state legislature.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen",

            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
