            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Twenty-five days after service of the amended complaint, the second defendant removed the action to a federal court in State B with the first defendant\u2019s consent. Was removal proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the first defendant was a citizen of the forum state.\nB. No, because the notice of removal was untimely.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCivil_procedure\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. To remove a case from state to federal court, the defendant must file a notice of removal within 30 days of receiving the complaint or within 30 days of the later of being served with the complaint or being served with an amended complaint. Here, the 30-day deadline was triggered by the amendment of the complaint 25 days after the original complaint was served. The notice of removal was therefore untimely, and the court would lack jurisdiction to hear the case. Therefore, the court must dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. Because the facts are undisputed and no party has entered a general denial, the court will take the allegations of the amended complaint as true. The amended complaint alleged that the defendant was negligent in operating a bus that collided with the plaintiff's car, that the defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury, and that the plaintiff therefore was entitled to damages in the amount of $120,000. The defendant was a citizen of State B, and the plaintiff was a citizen of State A. The amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, and the case therefore was within the federal courts' diversity jurisdiction. Here, the defendant and the first plaintiff were citizens of different states, and the case could be heard in federal court. Therefore, the defendant could validly remove the case to federal court.\n",

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served. Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the forum state prevented removal based on diversity.",

State A has a long-arm statute that permits personal jurisdiction to the constitutional limit. The defendant has moved for an order dismissing the action based on the personal-jurisdiction challenge asserted in the amended answer. Should the court issue the order?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect.

Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect.

Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger.

The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.",

The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense.

However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect.

The landlord\u2019s own investigation indicated that the fire had been caused by the tenant\u2019s leaving a soup pot unattended on a hot stove. The landlord has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the tenant failed to comply with a state law that requires plaintiffs suing for negligence to plead that they were not contributorily negligent.

The burden is on the defendant to show that there is no issue of fact for the jury to resolve on each issue on which the defendant has moved to have the case dismissed. Here, the tenant has alleged a negligence claim, and the landlord has moved to dismiss on the grounds that the tenant has not pleaded that he was not contributorily negligent. The tenant argues that the landlord must plead and prove that the tenant was contributorily negligent as an affirmative defense. However, the tenant has failed to plead that he was not contributorily negligent. Under Dunn v. Federman, 290 U.S. 547 (1934), the tenant must plead and prove his own negligence if he intends to recover damages for his own injury. Because the tenant has not pleaded that he was not contributorily negligent, the landlord has not waived the affirmative defense of contributory negligence. Therefore, the court must apply the relevant state law to determine whether the tenant is entitled to recover, and the burden is on the landlord to show that there is no issue of fact for the jury to resolve on the issue of the tenant's contributory negligence. Here, the facts are undisputed that the fire was started by the tenant's negligent behavior. Therefore, the landlord has the burden to show that the tenant is barred from recovery as a matter of law.

Thus, the broker's counterclaim is not compulsory, and the investor may not be required to join the contract claim as a counterclaim to her federal securities law claim.",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The facts of this scenario are similar to those in United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460 (2010), which held that the federal law making it a crime to depict animal cruelty was unconstitutional because the law did not satisfy the intermediate scrutiny standard required by United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968). Here, the tea at issue is not a commercial product, and the weed that produces it is readily available and not subject to federal regulation. Thus, the tea is not within the scope of the federal power to regulate commerce. Because the statute is not necessary to serve a significant federal interest, it is unconstitutional. A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that Congress may regulate the use of drugs under the Commerce Clause, but only when the regulated activity is itself commercial. Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). Here, the tea at issue is not a drug, and the defendant's possession of it is not a commercial activity. B is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the mere possession of a substance is not a commercial activity, and therefore cannot be regulated under the Commerce Clause. Fry v. United States, 461 U.S. 479 (1983). Here, the tea at issue is not a drug, and the defendant's possession of it is not a commercial activity. C is incorrect. The conduct at issue here--boiling water to make tea--is a personal activity that is not related to any commercial activity. The tea at issue is not a drug, and the defendant's possession of it is not a commercial activity. The facts of this scenario are not analogous to United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), which held that the federal law making it a crime to carry a gun within 1,000 feet of a school was unconstitutional because the law did not satisfy the intermediate scrutiny standard required by O'Brien.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC. Order the company to give the resident an opportunity for a hearing, because the Fourteenth Amendment applies to private entities performing public functions.\nD.

The resident has alleged only that the company deprived him of the use of his property--his water service--without affording him the procedural protections that the Constitution requires when a state or its agents deprive an individual of life, liberty, or property.

To obtain a license, a tutor is required to achieve a passing score on a state-administered exam in the tutor\u2019s area of specialty. On several occasions, an organization representing tutors licensed in the state has successfully lobbied against proposed legislation that would have eased the licensing requirement. An out-of-state tutoring company would like to conduct business in the state, but very few of its tutors are licensed by the state. The company has sued to challenge the law.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nThe privileges and immunities clause of the U.S. Constitution, found in U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a72, protects the \"privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States\" from abridgment by state governments. This clause was interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the seminal case of U.S. _Curt_ v. _Walker_ (1819) to prohibit states from enacting laws that unduly burden the right of a citizen of one state to enter and pursue a gainful occupation in another state. Here, the law burdens the right of the out-of-state tutoring company to enter the state and pursue its business by requiring that its tutors be licensed by the state. Because the law burdens the right of the out-of-state tutoring company to enter and pursue a gainful occupation in the state, it violates the privileges and immunities clause of the U.S. Constitution and will be invalid.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts.

Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Where there is no express contract, the UCC 2-207 creates an implied-in-fact contract. UCC 2-207 provides that where a seller receives a deposit from a buyer in connection with a sale of goods, the seller is held to a strict liability to take reasonable care to perform his obligations under the contract and to deliver goods that are as described. Here, the owner did not breach the implied-in-fact contract by failing to respond to the buyer's email. The buyer breached the contract by failing to pay the $15,000 by March 6. The buyer's breach justified the owner's decision to sell the car to her neighbor for $13,000 and to bring an action to recover the $2,000 difference in the purchase prices. Because the buyer breached the contract by failing to pay the $15,000 by March 6, the owner did not anticipatorily repudiate the contract by failing to respond to the buyer's email.

Where an express contract is unambiguous and there are no extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent, the language of the contract is given its ordinary meaning and will be enforced according to its terms. Where the language is ambiguous, however, the contract will be interpreted in accordance with the parties' intent as determined from all relevant evidence, including the circumstances giving rise to the contract, the parties' respective positions and abilities, and any relevant extrinsic evidence. Here, the contract is ambiguous because it does not include the discounted-rate provision that was orally agreed to. The best interpretation of the contract is that the landlord will pay the company $125 per hour for services in excess of 100 hours. Because the contract is ambiguous, the parties' intent will be determined from all relevant evidence, including the circumstances giving rise to the contract and the parties' respective positions and abilities. Here, the evidence shows that the parties were sophisticated and that they were equally knowledgeable about the subject matter of the contract. Thus, the parties are to be considered to be of equal bargaining strength, and any ambiguity will be interpreted against the party that drafted the contract. Because the landlord did not draft the contract, the discounted-rate provision will be interpreted in favor of the company and will be given the meaning that most favorably interprets the contract as a whole. That interpretation is that the landlord will pay the company $125 per hour for services in excess of 100 hours.

Conversion occurs when an actor intentionally interacts with an item that is the personal property of another so as to permanently deprive the other of possession.

The tree specialist\u2019s action meets the definition of conversion regardless of the fact that he was directed to take that action by the landowner. Answer D is incorrect. Because the tree specialist was hired by the landowner and cut down the trees at the direction of the landowner, the landowner (along with the tree specialist) is subject to liability for conversion.",

If the defendant succeeds in proving assumption of risk, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages, even if the defendant was negligent.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC. It is not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in places that are visible to neighbors.\nD.

To establish a private nuisance, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's conduct (1) was unreasonable and (2) interfered with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of land. Generally, a defendant will be found to have interfered with a plaintiff's use and enjoyment of land when the defendant's conduct has physically invaded the plaintiff's land or has interfered with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy the land in some other way. Here, the farmer's conduct has not physically invaded the homeowner's land or interfered with the homeowner's right to use and enjoy the land in some other way. The farmer's conduct has not therefore created a private nuisance. Here, the farmer's conduct has not therefore created a private nuisance. The farmer can argue that the homeowner has not established that the farmer's conduct has interfered with the homeowner's use and enjoyment of land.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect. An objection must be made at the earliest opportunity under FRE 103, and an objection that is made \u201cduring trial\u201d but not while the witness is still on the stand is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.",

Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 46 (1992) (holding that the \"plain-error\" standard should be used to review the sufficiency of the evidence to authenticate or identify evidence when the error did not occur at a hearing on a relevant preliminary fact and the evidence was not substantial). When the defendant is charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, the prosecution must prove that the defendant knew that the firearm was a gun and that he had been convicted of a felony. The officer who found the firearm in the defendant's apartment was not present when the apartment was searched and did not personally recover the firearm. The officer's testimony is therefore inadmissible to prove that the defendant knew that the firearm was a gun or that the defendant had been convicted of a felony. However, the officer's testimony is relevant to show that the apartment was the defendant's residence. If the apartment is the defendant's residence, the defendant is presumed to know that the apartment contains a firearm, and the prosecution may prove that the defendant knew that the firearm was a gun and that he had been convicted of a felony by presenting evidence that is authenticated by a showing that the apartment was the defendant's residence. Here, the officer's testimony is necessary to authenticate the mail addressed to the defendant at the apartment, the receipts bearing the defendant's credit card information, and the clothing of a size that would fit the defendant. Because the officer was not present when the apartment was searched and did not personally recover the evidence, his testimony is inadmissible to prove that the apartment was the defendant's residence. However, the officer's testimony is relevant to show that the apartment was the defendant's residence.

Here, the statement was made when the defendant was in a state of mind described by the excited-utterance exception, which applies when the statement was made to relieve an excited state of mind. The defendant was arrested and charged with the robbery shortly after the robbery, and his statement was made when he was being interrogated by the police. The prosecutor objects because the statement was not made while the defendant was testifying at his own trial. However, the defendant\u2019s statement is within the exception because it was made when he was in a state of mind described by the excited-utterance exception. The victim was shot and killed during the robbery, and the defendant was in a state of excitement when he was being interrogated by the police.

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness.

Here, the mother brought the action, so the burden is on her to prove that the purchaser had notice of the covenant. The mother is in privity with the purchaser because the purchaser bought the lot from the son, and the son received the lot from the mother as a gift. The mother is therefore estopped from asserting the covenant against the purchaser, who had no actual knowledge of the covenant. Because the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant, the purchaser has met her burden of proof and the mother's claim will be dismissed. A is incorrect. Although the mother is estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser, the mother is not estopped from enforcing the covenant against the son. Because the son was in privity with the mother, the son is bound by the covenant and is therefore estopped from asserting that he had no notice of the covenant. Because the son is estopped from asserting the lack of notice, the mother has met her burden of proof and the son's claim will be dismissed. B is incorrect. Although the covenant was not supported by consideration, the purchaser is not entitled to enforce the covenant. The purchaser is in privity with the son, and the son is in privity with the mother.

Seventeen years ago, the city discontinued using the land as a park. Because the city needed additional parking for nearby city buildings, it paved the land and has used it as a parking lot ever since. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Last year, the woman died intestate, leaving a son as her only heir. The son sued the city, claiming ownership of the land, but the court found against him. What is the most likely explanation for the court\u2019s decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The city acquired the land by adverse possession.\nB. The son\u2019s interest ended as a result of the changing needs of the city.\nC. The son\u2019s interest lapsed on the death of the woman.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nBecause the woman conveyed the land to the city with the condition that it be used for park purposes, the city's use of the land as a parking lot was a use that was inconsistent with the grant. Therefore, the city did not hold the land in fee simple, and the woman did not convey any interest in the land to the city. As a result, the son, as the woman's successor in interest, had a valid claim to title to the land. Because the son failed to prove that he was entitled to the land, the court found in favor of the city.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. An easement is either appurtenant or in gross. An easement is appurtenant when it runs with the land and benefits an estate to which the easement is attached. An easement in gross runs with the person and benefits that person alone. Here, the easement was created in favor of the woman, who later sold her land to the buyer. Because the easement was created in favor of the woman, and not in favor of the man, it is an easement in gross. Thus, the man did not create an easement appurtenant that would run with the man\u2019s land and benefit the buyer. The man received $10,000 when he granted the easement to the woman, and the buyer purchased the woman\u2019s land without notice of the easement. Thus, the man will likely prevail. A is incorrect. An easement appurtenant is created when the grantor conveys an interest in land to the grantee, and the easement runs with the land and benefits an estate to which the easement is attached.

The man did not receive $10,000 in exchange for granting the easement to the woman.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

To determine whether the man was serious, an undercover officer introduced himself to the man at a bar. The officer said that he had previously taken care of problems for angry spouses. After some discussion in which the man expressed his extreme anger at his ex-wife, the man offered the officer $5,000 to kill her. The officer agreed and made arrangements to meet the man at the bar the next day to collect the $5,000 payment. When the man showed up the next day at the bar, authorities immediately arrested him.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. To prove the man guilty of misprision of a felony, the state must show that the man (1) knew that a felony had been committed, and (2) concealed this knowledge from a public official. Here, the man offered to pay $5,000 to have his ex-wife killed. The man's offer was a clear invitation to commit the crime of murder, which is a felony. The man's offer was therefore evidence that he knew that a felony had been committed. The man's silence in the face of this evidence was evidence that he had concealed his knowledge of the felony from a public official, the officer. Because the man can be convicted of misprision of a felony, he cannot be convicted of any of the other crimes listed. A is incorrect. Attempted murder requires that the defendant act with the specific intent to kill. Here, the man did not act with the specific intent to kill his ex-wife. Rather, the man offered to pay $5,000 to have his ex-wife killed. The man's offer was a clear invitation to commit the crime of murder, which is a felony. The man's offer was therefore evidence that he did not act with the specific intent to kill his ex-wife. B is incorrect. To prove the man guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, the state must show that the man and one or more conspirators (1) agreed to commit the crime of murder, and (2) that one or more of the conspirators took an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Here, the man offered to pay $5,000 to have his ex-wife killed. The man's offer was a clear invitation to commit the crime of murder, which is a felony. The man's offer was therefore evidence that he and the officer agreed to commit the crime of murder. However, the man's offer was not evidence that the officer took an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. C is incorrect. To prove the man guilty of solicitation of murder, the state must show that the man (1) solicited another person to commit murder, and (2) that the person solicited was not a mere accomplice. Here, the man offered to pay $5,000 to have his ex-wife killed. The man's offer was a clear invitation to commit the crime of murder, which is a felony. The man's offer was therefore evidence that he solicited the officer to commit the crime of murder. However, the man's offer was not evidence that",

Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony.

Voluntary manslaughter, based on reckless operation of a vehicle.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter, based on the misdemeanor of reckless driving.\nD. No homicide offense.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Because there is no evidence of malice aforethought or of a depraved indifference to human life (as is required to prove murder) or of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation (as is required to prove voluntary manslaughter), the woman can be convicted only of involuntary manslaughter, based on the misdemeanor of reckless driving. (Charging a person with a lesser included offense is within the prosecutor's discretion. If the jury finds the woman guilty of involuntary manslaughter, it must find that her conduct was not sufficiently culpable to merit a conviction of the greater offense of reckless driving, which is a misdemeanor.)\n",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. On these facts, a jury could rationally find both that the woman was guilty of reckless driving and that her illegal conduct caused the truck driver\u2019s death. The woman\u2019s conduct constitutes involuntary manslaughter under a theory of \u201cmisdemeanor-manslaughter.\u201d Answer A is incorrect. The woman could be guilty of murder on a theory of malice aforethought only if she intended to kill the driver. But the facts do not remotely suggest that the woman had that intent. The facts also do not support any theory of imputed malice, such as felony murder or depraved indifference. Answer B is incorrect because the woman did not intend to kill the driver and thus cannot be guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Answer D is incorrect because a jury could rationally convict the woman of involuntary manslaughter.",

Under state law, police are required to obtain DNA samples from all persons arrested for felonies and to store those samples in a state registry. The police informed the defendant of the state law and said that they would be using a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample from him. The defendant did not object. The defendant was later acquitted of burglary. A year later, however, authorities matched the defendant\u2019s DNA to an unsolved sexual assault crime. The defendant, now charged with sexual assault, has moved to suppress the DNA sample as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Where a defendant is facing the death penalty, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Constitution requires that the sentencer, before imposing death, be permitted to consider any relevant mitigating evidence that is available and that its decision must be supported by a finding that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. In this case, the defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. After exhausting his state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. The court must grant the petition if it finds that there is a reasonable probability that, had the mitigating evidence been presented, the jury would have sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment rather than to death. Here, the defendant\u2019s background was so sordid that it was clearly relevant mitigating evidence. However, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate and present this evidence, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a decision by a capital sentencer to impose the death penalty cannot be set aside on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds if there are no mitigating circumstances that the sentencer could have found and that can be identified as being supported by evidence in the record considered as a whole. Here, the defendant presented no evidence that the jury would have found mitigating circumstances that the jury could not have found, and the defendant presented no evidence that the jury would have found the mitigating circumstances that the defendant\u2019s background was and that the jury did find. Therefore, the defendant has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that, had the mitigating evidence been presented, the jury would have sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment rather than to death. Therefore, the petition should be denied.\n",

            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
