The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nIn a suit based on a will, inheritance of $1 million depended upon whether the wife had survived her husband when both died in the crash of a small airplane. An applicable statute provided that, for purposes of distributing an estate after a common disaster, there was a rebuttable presumption that neither spouse had survived the other. A witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane she heard what she thought was a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d although by the time the two occupants were removed from the wreckage they were both dead. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.\nB. No, because the witness\u2019s testimony is too speculative to support a finding.\nC. Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.\nD. Yes, because it is relevant and not otherwise prohibited.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car\u2019s brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store\u2019s property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man\u2019s conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because he was committing a felony.\nC.

The suspect refused to produce the diary, citing the privilege against self-incrimination. Under what circumstances, if any, could the grand jury compel production of the diary over the suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It may compel production without granting immunity because the suspect was not compelled to write a diary.\nB. It may compel production only if the suspect is granted use and derivative use immunity from the act of production.\nC. It may compel production only if the suspect is granted transactional immunity.\nD. It may not compel production of a private diary under any circumstances.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization\u2019s request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization\u2019s placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator\u2019s decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the administrator\u2019s denial of space to the organization was a reasonable time, manner, and place\nrestriction of speech.\nB. No, because a public official may not allow the use of public facilities for the propagation of a message that he or she\nbelieves may create a false or misleading impression.\nC.

The callers warned of the risks of not obtaining prompt medical evaluation to detect injuries resulting from accidents and offered free examinations to determine whether the victims had suffered any injuries. In response to these complaints, the legislature enacted a law prohibiting medical care providers from soliciting any accident victim by telephone within 30 days of his or her accident. Which of the following is the most useful argument for the state to use in defending the constitutionality of the law?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Because the commercial speech that is the subject of this law includes some speech that is misleading, the First\nAmendment does not limit the power of the state to regulate that speech.\nB. Because the law regulates only commercial speech, the state need only demonstrate that the restriction is rationally\nrelated to achieving the state\u2019s legitimate interests in protecting the privacy of accident victims and in regulating the\nmedical profession.\nC.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

The investigation revealed that the sun\u2019s glare off of these trucks blinded the drivers of other vehicles. The state\u2019s legislature then enacted a law prohibiting commercial trucks with polished aluminum trailer exteriors from traveling on the state\u2019s highways. Litigation over the state law resulted in a final decision by the United States Supreme Court that the law impermissibly burdened interstate commerce and, therefore, was unconstitutional. Congress later enacted a statute permitting any state to enact a law regulating the degree of light reflectiveness of the exteriors of commercial trucks using the state\u2019s highways. Is this federal statute constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the U.S. Supreme Court has already determined that state laws of this type impermissibly burden\ninterstate commerce.\nB. No, because Article III vests the judicial power in the federal courts, the essence of judicial power is the ability to\nrender a final judgment, and this statute overrules a final judgment of the federal Supreme Court.\nC. Yes, because Article I, Section 8 grants Congress authority to enact statutes authorizing states to impose burdens on\ninterstate commerce that would otherwise be prohibited.\nD.

A law is not necessary to further a compelling government interest if there are available, effective alternatives that would serve the interest as well.

The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community\u2019s residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens\u2019 group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill. The agency officials moved to dismiss. Which of the following is the most appropriate basis for the court to dismiss this suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nB. The interest of the state in obtaining suitable sites for toxic waste landfills is sufficiently compelling to justify the\nselection of the community as a location for such a facility.\nC. The Eleventh Amendment bars suits of this kind in the federal courts.\nD. The case is not ripe for a decision on the merits.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

In response, Congress enacted a statute requiring each state legislature to enact a state law making it a crime for any person to sell, within 1,000 feet of any elementary or secondary school, any controlled substance that had previously been transported in interstate commerce. Is the federal statute constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress has no authority to require a state legislature to enact any specified legislation.\nB. No, because the sale of a controlled substance in close proximity to a school does not have a sufficiently close nexus\nto interstate commerce to justify its regulation by Congress.\nC. Yes, because it contains a jurisdictional provision that will ensure, on a case-by-case basis, that any particular\ncontrolled substance subject to the terms of this statute will, in fact, affect interstate commerce.\nD.

Although the landowner had posted signs that said, \u201cNo Hunting\u2014No Trespassing,\u201d hunters frequently intruded to kill the deer. Recently, the landowner built an eight-foot chain-link fence, topped by three strands of barbed wire, across a gully on her land that provided the only access to the area frequented by the deer. A wildlife photographer asked the landowner for permission to enter the property to photograph the deer. Because the landowner feared that any publicity would encourage further intrusions, she denied the photographer\u2019s request. Frustrated, the photographer attempted to climb the fence. He became entangled in the barbed wire and suffered extensive lacerations. The wounds became infected and ultimately caused his death. The photographer\u2019s personal representative brought an action against the landowner. Will the plaintiff prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the landowner may not use deadly force to protect her land from intrusion.\nB.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA hiker sustained a head injury when he was struck by a limb that fell from a tree. At the time of his injury, the hiker was walking through a forest on private property without the property owner\u2019s knowledge or permission. It was determined that the limb fell because the tree was infested with termites. In an action by the hiker against the property owner to recover for his head injury, will the hiker prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the property owner could not foresee that anyone would be injured.\nB. No, because the property owner breached no duty to the hiker, who was a trespasser.\nC.

The hiker was clearly a trespasser on the property owner's land. A person who is injured while on the land of another as a trespasser cannot recover damages from the landowner unless the landowner is negligent in creating the danger. The property owner was not negligent here; he did not create the danger that injured the hiker. The hiker was injured when a limb fell from a tree on the property owner's land.

Upon learning of the delivery service\u2019s contract with the airline company, the food company terminated its contract with the delivery service in order to cause the airline company to lose the business. When the food company terminated the delivery service\u2019s contract, the delivery service had no choice but to terminate the airline company\u2019s contract. If the airline company sues the delivery service for tortious interference with contract, will the airline company prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the airline company and the delivery service were the parties to the contract.\nB. No, because the airline company was not in privity with the food company.\nC.

Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.

Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale.

The contract stipulated that the seller would deliver to the buyer, upon the payment of the last installment due, \u201ca warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\u201d The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The buyer entered into possession of the land. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the buyer discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on the land, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25 percent of the purchase price that the buyer had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the seller had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the seller. The value of the land was then four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller\u2019s alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the buyer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nB. Yes, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a mortgage and the outstanding mortgage impairs the\nbuyer\u2019s equity of redemption.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The buyer has not alleged that the seller is personally liable on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer has alleged that the seller has breached the contract, but that is not enough to make the seller personally liable on the mortgage debt. The buyer must prove that the seller is personally liable on the mortgage debt. Because there is no evidence that the seller is personally liable on the mortgage debt, the buyer must look to the seller's assets to satisfy the debt. The seller's interest in the land is his most valuable asset. Thus, the buyer must be able to recover the value of the seller's interest in the land. The seller's interest in the land is worth four times the amount due on the mortgage. The buyer can recover that amount from the seller if the seller is found to be personally liable on the mortgage debt. Because there is no evidence that the seller is personally liable on the mortgage debt, the buyer can recover the amount that the seller's interest in the land is worth--four times the amount due on the mortgage--by proving that the seller breached the contract.\n\n",

The seller has made all mortgage payments timely. The amount of the mortgage debt is 25 percent of the purchase price the buyer will pay, and the land is four times more valuable than the debt owed, so it is likely that the mortgage debt will be paid off by the time the seller must provide the warranty deed, and thus the buyer is not entitled to damages at this time.",

On April 27, the seller notified the buyer that she had discovered that the land was subject to a longstanding easement in favor of a corporation for a towpath for a canal, should the corporation ever want to build a canal. The buyer thought it so unlikely that a canal would be built that the closing should occur notwithstanding this outstanding easement. Therefore, the buyer notified the seller on April 28 that he would expect to close on May 1. When the seller refused to close, the buyer sued for specific performance. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the easement renders the seller\u2019s title unmarketable.\nB. No, because rights of third parties are unresolved.\nC. Yes, because the decision to terminate the contract for title not being marketable belongs only to the buyer.\nD.

She lived in a distant state and decided to sell the land to a colleague who was interested in purchasing the land as an investment. They orally agreed upon a price, and, at the colleague\u2019s insistence, the niece agreed to provide him with a warranty deed without any exceptions. The price was paid, the warranty deed was delivered, and the deed was promptly and properly recorded. Neither the niece nor the colleague had, at that point, ever seen the land. After recording the deed, the colleague visited the land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to any public right-of-way and that none of the surrounding lands had ever been held in common ownership with any previous owner of the tract of land. The colleague sued the niece for damages. For whom will the court find?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The colleague, because lack of access makes title unmarketable.\nB.

Fifteen years ago, after a part of the path located on his land and connecting his cabin to the public highway washed out, the man cleared a small part of his neighbor\u2019s land and rerouted a section of the path through the neighbor\u2019s land. Twelve years ago, the neighbor leased her land to some hunters. For the next 12 years, the hunters and the man who had rerouted the path used the path for access to the highway. A month ago, the neighbor discovered that part of the path was on her land. The neighbor told the man that she had not given him permission to cross her land and that she would be closing the rerouted path after 90 days. The man\u2019s land and the neighbor\u2019s land have never been in common ownership. The period of time necessary to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The period of time necessary to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. What should the lawyer tell the man concerning his right to use the rerouted path on the neighbor\u2019s land?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The neighbor's failure to assert a claim of right within the applicable period of time will preclude her from asserting that claim at a later time. The neighbor's failure to assert a claim of right to the path within the applicable period of time was a failure to exercise reasonable diligence, which will be deemed as an abandonment of any such claim.

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \u201cIt is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\u201d Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor\u2019s intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor\u2019s proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owners of lots in the subdivision own property benefitted by the original residential covenant and\nhave the sole right to enforce it.\nB. No, because the man owns property benefitted by the original restrictive covenant and has a right to enforce it.\nC.

The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA grantor owned two tracts of land, one of 15 acres and another of five acres. The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee\u2019s will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. The grantee\u2019s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might\nhave.\nC. The two tracts of land were not adjacent parcels of real estate, and thus the right to purchase is in gross and is\ntherefore unenforceable.\nD. Noncompliance with a right to purchase gives rise to a claim for money damages, but not for specific performance.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The provision setting out the right to purchase is an unambiguous limitation on the grantor's power to convey. It is therefore a covenant, and the Rule Against Perpetuities applies to covenants. Because the Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in this jurisdiction, the provision setting out the right to purchase is invalid.\n",

            "explanation": "Fifteen years ago each of the parties granted a reciprocal right of first refusal (or a preemptive right) to the other. A right of first refusal is a conditional option. It provides that if the owner ever decides to sell the property, the one holding the right of first refusal has the right to purchase it. In this case, the price for the purchase was to be set by three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers and was thus fair. The right, however, violates the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. The right to purchase is triggered by the decision of one to sell his or her land. In this case, that decision might occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the right was granted. Thus, under the common law, the right of first refusal is struck ab initio. The question notes that the common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in this jurisdiction. Thus, there are no applicable statutory reforms to the rule, and because the question is written with the daughter winning, any statute which may exempt a commercial transaction is inapplicable.",

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA homeowner and a contractor entered into a contract for the construction of a home for the price of $300,000. The contractor was to earn a profit of $10,000 for the job. After the contractor had spent $45,000 on labor and materials, including $5,000 on oak flooring not yet installed, the homeowner informed the contractor that the homeowner had lost his job and could not pay for any services. The homeowner told the contractor to stop working immediately. The reasonable market value of the labor and materials provided by the contractor at that point, including the oak flooring, was $40,000. The contractor used the $5,000 worth of oak flooring on another job. In an action by the contractor against the homeowner for damages, which of the following would be the largest amount of damages recoverable by the contractor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $40,000, the reasonable value of the services the contractor had provided.\nB. $40,000, the contractor\u2019s construction costs.\nC. $50,000, the contractor\u2019s construction costs of $45,000 plus the $10,000 profit minus the $5,000 saved by reusing the\noak flooring on another job.\nD. $55,000, the contractor\u2019s construction costs of $45,000 plus the $10,000 profit.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The victim was a friend of the defendant. The victim had $10,000 in his pocket and was on his way to visit the defendant when the victim was attacked and robbed by a mugger. The mugger took the $10,000 from the victim's pocket. The victim was injured in the attack but was able to identify the mugger. The victim did not report the $10,000 taken from his pocket to the police. The victim went to the house of the defendant and told the defendant that the defendant had better come up with $10,000 or the victim would go to the police and charge the defendant with extorting him. The defendant called a friend and borrowed $10,000. The defendant then gave the $10,000 to the victim and received the victim's written promise to go to the police and say that the defendant had extorted $10,000 from him if the victim was not paid $10,000. The defendant is on trial for extorting $10,000 from the victim.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The poster was an offer by the bank to pay $25 to any customer who waited in line for more than five minutes. The customer's action to sue the bank for $25 is a claim that the bank breached its obligation under the offer.

The customer's conduct in waiting in line for 10 more minutes was a prompt and unambiguous response to the bank's offer. The bank's failure to honor its offer to pay $25 to any customer who waited in line for more than five minutes led the customer to reasonably believe that the bank was not going to honor the offer and to engage in conduct (waiting in line for 10 more minutes) that was necessary to complete the performance that was an inducement for the bank to make the offer.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The builder orally offered to perform the work for $200,000 if his pending bid on another project was rejected. The homeowner accepted the builder\u2019s terms and the builder then prepared a written contract that both parties signed. The contract did not refer to the builder\u2019s pending bid. One week later, upon learning that his pending bid on the other project had been accepted, the builder refused to perform any work for the homeowner. Can the homeowner recover for the builder\u2019s nonperformance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because efficiency principles justify the builder\u2019s services being directed to a higher-valued use.\nB. No, because the builder\u2019s duty to perform was subject to a condition.\nC. Yes, because the builder\u2019s attempt to condition his duty to perform rendered the contract illusory.\nD. Yes, because the parol evidence rule would bar the builder from presenting evidence of oral understandings not\nincluded in the final writing.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The efficiency principle is that a person should use his or her resources to bring about the best possible result, taking into account the circumstances. Here, the builder's resources are his time and labor, which he was to use to construct the addition. The best use of those resources would be to perform the work for which he was already under contract, the homeowner's addition.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAn accountant and a bookkeeper, as part of a contract dissolving their accounting business, agreed that each would contribute $100,000 to fund an annuity for a clerk who was a longtime employee of the business. The clerk\u2019s position would be terminated due to the dissolution, and he did not have a retirement plan. The accountant and the bookkeeper informed the clerk of their plan to fund an annuity for him. The clerk, confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity, purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100,000 to fund the annuity, but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50,000. The accountant agreed that the bookkeeper should contribute only $50,000. Does the clerk have a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the clerk was bound by the modification of the agreement made by the accountant and the bookkeeper.\nB. No, because the clerk was only a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper, and\nhad no vested rights.\nC. Yes, because the clerk\u2019s reliance on the promised retirement fund prevented the parties from changing the terms.\nD. Yes, because the promises to establish the fund were made binding by consideration from the clerk\u2019s many years of\nemployment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

A woman who is 17 years old resides with her mother but is jointly entitled to a trust fund that is held in the name of the mother. The mother is unmarried and is 45 years old. The mother wishes to marry, but she does not want to marry the father of the 17-year-old woman. The mother has a son who is 25 years old and who resides with her. The mother is willing to marry the son if he will agree to pay her $100,000. The mother, the 17-year-old woman, and the 25-year-old son are all residents of a state in which a husband has a right to control the property of a wife. If the 25-year-old son is married to the 17-year-old woman and they reside in the state in which they are now living, and if the 25-year-old son has $100,000 in his own name, and if a court in that state is called upon to decide whether the 25-year-old son could successfully prevent a joint action by the mother and the 17-year-old woman to have a court divide the trust fund equally between the mother and the 17-year-old woman, what decision should the court make?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The 25-year-old son cannot successfully prevent the joint action, because he is a joint owner of the trust fund.\nB. The 25-year-old son cannot successfully prevent the joint action, because the mother has as much right as the 25-year-old son to control the property of the 17-year-old woman.\nC. The 25-year-old son can successfully prevent the joint action, because the 25-year-old son is not married to the 17-year-old woman.\nD. The 25-year-old son can successfully prevent the joint action, because the 25-year-old son has as much property as is necessary to satisfy the judgment that would be entered if the court divided the trust fund equally.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nDomestic",

On March 2, the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer\u2019s order was for a rush job, the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day\u2019s delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25,000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25,000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5,000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid, which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic\u2019s best defense to the textile company\u2019s action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Time was not of the essence in the contract between the mechanic and the textile company.\nB. The mechanic had no reason to foresee on March 1 that the customer would suffer consequential damages in the\namount of $25,000.\nC. By entering into the contract with the customer while knowing that its knitting machine was being repaired, the textile\ncompany assumed the risk of any delay loss to the customer.\nD. In all probability, the liquidated damages paid by the textile company to the customer are not the same amount as the\nactual damages sustained by the customer in consequence of the late delivery of the cloth.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Under the agreement, the buyer was obligated to make a selection by March 1 of the quantities of the various candy bars to be delivered under the contract. The buyer did not make the selection by March 1, and on March 2 the seller notified the buyer that because of the buyer\u2019s failure to select, the seller would not deliver the candy bars. The seller had all of the necessary candy bars on hand on March 1 and made no additional sales or purchases on March 1 or March 2. On March 2, after receiving the seller\u2019s notice that it would not perform, the buyer notified the seller of its selection and insisted that the seller perform. The seller refused. If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, is the buyer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a contract did not exist until selection of the specific candy bars, and the seller withdrew its offer before\nselection.\nB. No, because selection of the candy bars by March 1 was an express condition to the seller\u2019s duty to perform.\nC. Yes, because a delay of one day in making the selection did not have a material effect on the seller.\nD.
