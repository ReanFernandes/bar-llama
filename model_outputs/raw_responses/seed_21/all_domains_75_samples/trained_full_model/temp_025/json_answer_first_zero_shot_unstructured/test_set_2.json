Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD.

It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements.

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law. A state\u2019s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor\u2019s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law \u201cto conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,\u201d making the debtor\u2019s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment.

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter.

The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. A Miranda warning is required whenever a suspect is (1) in custody and (2) being subjected to custodial interrogation. Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers. However, as the Court held in Minnesota v. Murphy, neither of those entitlements transforms the exchange into a custodial interrogation.",

The police then subpoenaed the cell- phone provider to provide one year of historical cell-phone site-location data. The data showed that for each incident, the resident\u2019s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the vandalized property. The resident was charged with multiple counts of destruction of property. Defense counsel has moved to exclude the cell-phone site-location data, arguing that its collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Did the collection of the data violate the Fourth Amendment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party.\nB.

Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct because a reasonable jury could find that the defendant was twice kicked in the groin by the victim prior to the homicide, and on that basis could conclude that the defendant had adequate provocation. Even      though it is a single witness who recounts this event, a jury can credit a single witness\u2019s testimony. Answer A is incorrect because the state offered evidence of a serious battery on the defendant, which can constitute an adequate provocation, no matter which party presented the evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the judge\u2019s job is not to weigh the evidence but is only to determine whether a reasonable jury could find adequate provocation. The jury may permissibly credit one single witness\u2019s account, even when that account contradicts ample other evidence. Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis. For instance, if there were no evidence of provocation, but the defense sought a manslaughter instruction, such an instruction should be denied.",

After trial, defense counsel learned that the prosecution had failed to disclose that the key witness against the defendant had previously been convicted of perjury in another case. The defense filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court rejected the defense argument and upheld the conviction because state discovery rules did not require the disclosure. The defendant then filed an appeal, arguing that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose this prior perjury conviction had violated his federal constitutional rights. Can the state appellate court overturn the conviction based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the witness\u2019s prior perjury conviction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because discovery is regulated by state rather than federal procedure.\nB. No, because the prior conviction was mere impeachment rather than evidence of actual innocence.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct because the prosecution has a constitutional obligation to turn over material exculpatory evidence, which includes evidence that would impeach a critical government witness. Here, the government\u2019s key witness had a conviction for an offense\u2014perjury\u2014that directly related to the witness\u2019s credibility. If the failure to disclose that information created a reasonable probability of a different outcome, then the appellate court should reverse the conviction. Answer A is incorrect because, although generally discovery is governed by state rules, the due process clause contains some core rights, such as the right to disclosure of critical exculpatory evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the scope of due process is not limited to proof of actual innocence. The government must disclose any evidence favorable to the defendant that could affect the outcome of the case. Answer D is incorrect because the due process clause requires disclosure only if the evidence is significant enough to affect the outcome. If the appellate court concludes that the outcome would not have been affected by disclosure of the witness\u2019s prior conviction, then there is no basis for reversal.",

The defendant had retained private defense counsel. As part of the prosecution\u2019s case, a federal agent testified regarding incriminating statements that the defendant\u2019s confederate, who by the time of trial was a fugitive, had made during a prior interview. Though this testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, the defense attorney raised no objection. The jury ultimately convicted the defendant.

If the appeals court finds that the trial court should not have admitted the testimony, does it have the authority to reverse a conviction when the trial attorney raised no objection to the challenged testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because failure to object waives a defendant\u2019s rights.\nB. No, because the sole remedy is a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nC.

Here, the error was obvious, of constitutional dimension, and likely prejudicial. Consequently, the court of appeals has authority to reverse the conviction. Answer A is incorrect because, although a defendant\u2019s failure to object can change the standard of appellate review, it does not foreclose review. Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on direct appeal.

Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, \u201cpenalized\u201d by an attorney\u2019s failure to object.

Immediately after buying the car, the friend took it to his mechanic, who completed minor repairs and told the friend that he estimated the car\u2019s actual mileage to be approximately 100,000. Assuming no applicable statutes, is the friend likely to prevail in an action to rescind his purchase of the car from the woman?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
