Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law.

By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory. Such facially discriminatory laws are allowed only in the absence of any nondiscriminatory way to promote the government\u2019s interest. C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994). Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest. Answer C is incorrect. Because the law is facially discriminatory, it is not subject to the \u201cundue burden\u201d test.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land. Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here. Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

The burning of the one-dollar bills was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, because the speaker intended the burning to communicate a message, and in context, the audience was likely to receive the message. The ordinance, however, does not violate the First Amendment because it is content-neutral and it satisfies the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which are stated correctly in Answer A.

It is true that the ordinance prohibits conduct, but on these facts, the burning of the one-dollar bills was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, because the speaker intended the burning to communicate a message, and in context, the audience was likely to receive the message. In this situation, the ordinance satisfies the First Amendment not simply because it regulates conduct, but because it is content-neutral and it satisfies the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations is not the proper standard. Because the government is demanding public access to the property in exchange for a permit to build, the test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. In Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency. Here, the police lawfully knocked and announced their presence at the door. That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the police conduct\u2014knocking and announcing their presence\u2014was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. A Miranda warning is required whenever a suspect is (1) in custody and (2) being subjected to custodial interrogation. Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.

First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data.
