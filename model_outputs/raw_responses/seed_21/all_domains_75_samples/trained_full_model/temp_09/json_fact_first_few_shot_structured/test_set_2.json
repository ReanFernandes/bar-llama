Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct because on its face the ordinance discriminates against commerce from outside the city. By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory. Such facially discriminatory laws are allowed only in the absence of any nondiscriminatory way to promote the government\u2019s interest. C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994). Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest. Answer C is incorrect. Because the law is facially discriminatory, it is not subject to the \u201cundue burden\u201d test.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land. Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here. Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations is not the proper standard. Because the government is demanding public access to the property in exchange for a permit to build, the test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Answer D is incorrect. Whether or not the condition substantially advances a legitimate interest of the city is not the proper standard.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. In Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency. Here, the police lawfully knocked and announced their presence at the door. That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the police conduct\u2014knocking and announcing their presence\u2014was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.",

Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v.

However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct because, under the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, an appellate court may remedy an error that was plain or obvious if that error affected substantial rights. Here, the error was obvious, of constitutional dimension, and likely prejudicial. Consequently, the court of appeals has authority to reverse the conviction. Answer A is incorrect because, although a defendant\u2019s failure to object can change the standard of appellate review, it does not foreclose review. Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on direct appeal. For such errors, the defendant is not required to claim or prove ineffective assistance of counsel. Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, \u201cpenalized\u201d by an attorney\u2019s failure to object. Because the attorney did not object, the defendant must now meet the stringent requirements of the plain-error standard. Had the error been preserved by a contemporaneous objection, the standard of review would be more favorable to the defendant.",

The lease does not explicitly say that the owner may enter the house to show it to prospective lessees, but such a right may be fairly implied in order to carry out the intention of the parties.

Best efforts is a duty read into a contract to prevent it from being illusory when the scope of a party\u2019s performance is omitted or unclear. The duty of best efforts, which requires all parties to use their best efforts to carry out the intent of the contract, is not relevant here. Answer D is incorrect.

An intended beneficiary can enforce a contract to which it is not a party, because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302. However, one party to the contract can assert, against the beneficiary, claims for breach by the other party to the contract. Here, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to perform the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for breach of that promise against the bank. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 309(2). Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to do the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for damages against the bank, as an intended beneficiary. Answer C is incorrect. The bank is not an incidental beneficiary. Instead the bank is an intended beneficiary that can enforce a contract to which it is not a party because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary.

And even if the carpenter\u2019s breach was material, the bank could recover the value of the work done for the homeowner as restitution. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374.",

Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation.

On a weekday at 12:00 noon, he delivered an excited, animated, and loud harangue on the steps of the State Capitol in front of the main entryway. An audience of 200 onlookers, who gathered on the steps, heckled him and laughed as he delivered his tirade. An equal number of people passed by on the street and heard the speech but did not stop. The owner of the manufacturing firm repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that \"the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid,\" and that \"I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live.\" After about fifteen minutes the owner of the milk container manufacturing firm stopped speaking and the amused crowd dispersed.There are two relevant statutes of the state. The first statute prohibits \"all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m.-8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m.-1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m.-5:15 p.m., Monday through Friday.\" The other statute prohibits",

Answer C is incorrect. FRE 408(a)(2) distinguishes between settlement negotiations involving private parties and those involving a public office. Statements made in negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its enforcement authority may be admissible in a subsequent criminal case.

Because the fire marshal is a public official and his conclusion about the cause of the fire is a factual finding based upon an official investigation, the report is admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. The witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception, however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement must be excised from the report. Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under      a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation protects defendants only in criminal cases and so does not protect the neighbor in this civil action. Answer D is incorrect. Public officials may rely on bystander statements and hearsay in making factual findings.

The complaint alleged breach of contract claims arising from construction delays and deficient electrical work that had caused the corporation significant financial losses. The general contractor filed a crossclaim against the subcontractor, asserting only the defense that the general contractor was not liable to the corporation because the subcontractor\u2019s deficient work was the sole cause of the construction delays and the corporation\u2019s losses. After discovery, the corporation settled with the general contractor and dismissed the claims against it. The subcontractor has moved to dismiss the general contractor\u2019s crossclaim. Which of the following arguments best supports the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The crossclaim is improper, because it asserts a defense, not a claim for relief.\nB. The crossclaim is improper, because the general contractor and the subcontractor are opposing parties, not co-parties.\nC.

There is no authority under Rule 13(g) to allow an attempt to assert a defense against the plaintiff so as to shift direct liability for damages owed to the plaintiff to a codefendant.

Even if the corporation\u2019s claim against the general contractor has been dismissed, as long as the crossclaim remains undetermined, the general contractor and the subcontractor remain in the suit for purposes of that claim. Answer D is incorrect. Rule 13(g) specifically provides that a crossclaim may include a claim that the co-party is or \u201cmay be\u201d liable for all or part of the claim asserted in the main action.

However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond.

The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect.

If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable.

Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Answer C is incorrect. To obtain a discretionary interlocutory appeal, the party seeking to appeal must apply to both the district and appellate courts to meet the statutory standards. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Because the scientist has appealed without attempting to satisfy that requirement, the appeal cannot be treated as a discretionary interlocutory appeal. Answer D is incorrect. Under the final judgment rule, a judgment is not final until all the claims in the action have been resolved. While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.",

At issue is whether the entrepreneur had record (constructive) notice of the restriction. If so, the entrepreneur would not be a good-faith purchaser for value.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC.

Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order in which they were executed. The developer made all payments on both mortgage loans for several years but eventually defaulted on the loan from the seller, who threatened to initiate foreclosure proceedings. To avoid the foreclosure, the developer executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure conveying the land back to the seller. But before the developer delivered the deed to the seller, it notified the investor of the proposed conveyance and gave her the option to cure the developer\u2019s default on the seller\u2019s loan. The investor declined to do so, and the developer delivered the deed to the seller. If nothing else has happened since the conveyance to the seller, is the investor\u2019s mortgage still valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other. Which party is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because a default will be implied by the court under these facts.\nB.

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by deed\u201d or \u201cafter-acquired property.\u201d Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple to the purchaser (the son\u2019s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired it from the son.      Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death.

The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and the trucker did not contribute to the accident, so the jury is permitted to conclude that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. Answer A is incorrect. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and since the trucker did not contribute to the accident, the jury can infer that the cattle escaped due to the farmer\u2019s negligence. While it is of course possible that a third party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer\u2019s negligence in this case. Answer B is incorrect. The trucker needs to establish that the farmer was in exclusive control of the pen, that the accident would not have occurred but for negligence, and that the accident was not due to the trucker\u2019s own actions.

The rupture resulted from a defect in the tire that existed at the time it was sold by the manufacturer to a retailer, who sold it to the driver and installed it on her car. The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year. After discovering this memorandum, the driver\u2019s attorney filed a timely amended complaint, adding a claim for battery. The manufacturer has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the battery claim, based on the undisputed facts set out above. If no additional facts are provided to the court concerning the risk of tire rupture, should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care to prevent ruptures.\nB. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that consumers would be injured by tire ruptures.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The driver might have a valid strict products liability claim against the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support a finding\u2014required for battery liability\u2014that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect. There is no rule of tort law stating that a plaintiff is prohibited from pursuing claims for battery and products liability on the basis of the same set of facts.",

A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a finished product by the product\u2019s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the component is what rendered the finished product defective.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The company, through its employee, engaged in conduct that a jury could determine to be intrusion upon seclusion. Intrusion upon seclusion is one of the four privacy torts recognized by the Second Restatement of Torts and most states. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A\u2013E (1977). Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the company did not expressly authorize the security officer\u2019s specific actions does not necessarily allow it to avoid liability. The security officer was an employee of the company, and the company both directed the officer to investigate the woman and provided the officer with her phone number. On this basis, a jury could reasonably hold the company liable based on the officer\u2019s actions. Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s breach of the noncompetition agreement, if any, would not prevent a reasonable jury from concluding that the company is liable to the woman for intrusion upon seclusion. Whether the company has a cause of action against the woman for breach of the agreement is a separate question. Answer C is incorrect. There is no evidence that the company or the security officer acted with an intent to cause the woman severe emotional distress, or recklessly with respect to that risk, or even that the woman suffered severe emotional distress.",

Two years ago, as a cost- saving measure, the company reduced the number of dispatchers to six, and each of the remaining dispatchers had to work substantially longer hours. One of the remaining dispatchers complained to his supervisor that the stress and fatigue associated with the new working conditions were too much for him to handle.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Negligently caused emotional distress is ordinarily not actionable unless connected to a physical injury. Answer A is incorrect. Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty. As noted earlier, courts generally do not recognize a duty to take care against causing emotional distress unconnected to a physical injury. Answer D is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

During jury selection, the trial court, over the defendant's objection, excused five prospective jurors who indicated upon questioning by both parties and the trial court that they personally were opposed to the death penalty and were unsure if they could ever vote to impose it. The trial court then gave the jury instructions that included a capital sentencing instruction that the jury must follow in its entirety, that the jury had the option of sentencing the defendant to death or to life in prison without parole, and that, in making its sentencing decision, the jury should consider all of the instructions that had been given to it. The trial court also instructed the jury that if it sentenced the defendant to death, its verdict should be accompanied by a special finding that the defendant had been convicted of a capital offense and that the jury had heard all of the evidence and considered all of the instructions in reaching its verdict. The jury convicted the defendant and, in the special finding, said it had heard all of the evidence and considered all of the instructions, but it sentenced the defendant to life in prison. The defendant was not surprised by the jury's decision but argued that the trial court erred in excusing the prospective jurors and that, had the jurors",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A rule of products liability law states that there is no recovery if a defect in a product causes damage only to the product itself (as opposed to personal injury, or injury to other property). This rule is sometimes referred to as the \u201ceconomic loss rule.\u201d In such cases, the owner of the damaged product is limited to contract remedies. Answer B is incorrect. The absence of negligence on the part of the manufacturer does not provide a basis for denying recovery to the couple on a strict products liability claim. Answer C is incorrect. Recovery on a strict products liability claim does not depend on whether the evidence supports an inference of manufacturer negligence. Answer D is incorrect for the reasons stated in the explanation for answer A.",

Under the sponsorship agreement, the dealership was required to arrange for licensed and trained emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to be present during the race. The dealership contracted with a licensed and reputable emergency medical services (EMS) firm that supplied EMTs for events such as these. A motorcyclist participating in the race was injured when he lost control of his motorcycle. The motorcyclist was treated at the scene by the EMTs. In removing the motorcyclist\u2019s helmet, one of the EMTs twisted the motorcyclist\u2019s neck, causing him to become permanently paralyzed. The motorcyclist has sued both the EMS firm and the dealership, alleging that the EMT\u2019s careless conduct caused his paralysis. Assuming the validity of the motorcyclist\u2019s negligence claim against the EMS firm, which of the following best characterizes the dealership\u2019s potential liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The dealership is directly liable for hiring the EMS firm.\nB. The dealership is vicariously liable, because it owed a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care for the race.\nC.

Because the dealership\u2019s duty of care was delegable, because the dealership was not negligent in hiring the EMS firm, and because the EMT was not an employee of the dealership, there is no basis for holding the dealership liable, whether directly or vicariously.
