The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA homeowner was using a six-foot stepladder to clean the furnace in his home. The homeowner broke his arm when he slipped and fell from the ladder. The furnace had no warnings or instructions on how it was to be cleaned. In a suit by the homeowner against the manufacturer of the furnace to recover for his injury, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the danger of falling from a ladder is obvious.\nB. No, because the homeowner should have hired a professional to clean the furnace.\nC. Yes, because the furnace did not have a ladder attached to it for cleaning purposes.\nD. Yes, because the lack of warnings or instructions for how to clean the furnace made the furnace defective.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The homeowner is not likely to prevail because the risk of falling from a ladder is obvious. Falls from ladders are a common source of injuries and the homeowner knew that he was at risk of falling when he decided to clean the furnace. B is incorrect. The homeowner is not likely to prevail because it is unlikely that the manufacturer of the furnace is liable for the injuries caused by the use of a ladder. C is incorrect. The fact that there was no ladder attached to the furnace has no bearing on the case. D is incorrect. The manufacturer is not liable for the homeowner's injuries unless the manufacturer failed to warn of a danger that was discoverable through the exercise of due care.

Fortunately, the phone rang and awakened the student. The roommate retreated quickly and threw the ice pick under his own bed in the same room. The next day, the student heard from friends about the roommate\u2019s murderous plans and later found the ice pick under the roommate\u2019s bed. Even though the college expelled his roommate, the student remained extremely upset and afraid to sleep. In a suit against the roommate for assault, will the student prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the roommate did not touch the student.\nB. No, because the student was not awake when the roommate entered the room and was unaware until later that the\nroommate was intending to attack him.\nC. Yes, because it was reasonable for the student to feel afraid of sleeping in his room afterward.\nD. Yes, because the roommate intended to inflict serious harm.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The student is the plaintiff in an action for assault. Assault is a attempt to commit a criminal battery. To prevail in his claim, the student must show that the roommate was intending to commit a criminal battery against him, and that the student apprehended an offensive touching. The roommate entered the room, and threw the ice pick under the bed, all while still being drunk and enraged. These actions, along with the friends telling the student about the murderous plans, and the student's continued fear and insomnia, show that the roommate did, in fact, attempt to commit a criminal battery against the student, and that the student apprehended an offensive touching. A is incorrect. The roommate need not have actually touched the student to be liable for assault. C is incorrect. The student cannot recover damages for his emotional distress. While he may have been fearful, there has been no actual injury to the student. D is incorrect. The roommate need not have had the intent to inflict serious harm to be liable for assault.

Vehicles made by the manufacturer of the motorist\u2019s car have been found to be negligently designed, making them dangerously prone to rolling over when they suffer blowouts. A truck driver who was driving behind the motorist when the accident occurred stopped to help. Rescue vehicles promptly arrived, and the truck driver walked along the side of the road to return to his truck. As he approached his truck, he was struck and injured by a speeding car. The truck driver has sued the manufacturer of the injured motorist\u2019s car. Is the truck driver likely to prevail in a suit against the car manufacturer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the car manufacturer\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of the truck driver\u2019s injuries.\nB. No, because the truck driver assumed the risk of injury when he undertook to help the motorist.\nC. Yes, because it is foreseeable that injuries can result from rollovers.\nD. Yes, because the car manufacturer\u2019s negligence caused the dangerous situation that invited the rescue by the truck\ndriver.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. With the exception of medical malpractice claims, a plaintiff generally cannot recover damages unless the plaintiff's injuries were a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions. In this case, the car manufacturer has been held to be negligent in designing its vehicles to be more prone to rolling over in blowout situations. It is a foreseeable consequence of a vehicle that is more prone to rolling over in blowout situations to cause injuries to a person who is standing near the road when the vehicle rolls over. A is incorrect. The car manufacturer's negligence must be the proximate cause of the truck driver's injuries for the truck driver to prevail in his claim against the car manufacturer. The car manufacturer's negligence does not cause the truck driver's injuries to be a proximate cause of the car manufacturer's negligence. C is incorrect. While it is foreseeable that injuries could result from the dangerous situation, the car manufacturer has not acted with the purpose of causing the truck driver to be injured. D is incorrect.

The landowner\u2019s mini-golf business had greatly declined as a consequence, and the value of his property had gone down markedly. Is the landowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the landowner has offered no evidence demonstrating that the gas company was negligent.\nB. No, because the refinery conforms to the zoning requirements.\nC. Yes, because the refinery has substantially and unreasonably interfered with the landowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of his\nproperty.\nD.

The key issue here is whether the gas company's negligence was such that it could be considered a substantial interference. A is incorrect. The landowner has offered evidence that the gas company was negligent, but negligence is not a necessary element for private nuisance. B is incorrect.

Instead of posting \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, the farmer decided to install an alarm system to deter intruders. While the farmer was in the farmhouse installing the alarm system, he heard a window open in the adjoining room. The farmer crept very quietly to the door of the room, threw the door open, and found an intruder, a young child. The farmer immediately struck the child, a 10-year-old girl, very hard in the face, breaking her nose. In an action on behalf of the child against the farmer to recover for the injury to her nose, is the child likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the farmer did not use deadly force.\nB.

In order to resolve their differences, each drove his truck to an open pasture area on his land where the two properties were separated by a fence. The rancher was accompanied by four friends, and the neighbor was alone. The neighbor got out of his truck and walked toward the fence. The rancher got out but simply stood by his truck. When the neighbor came over the fence, the rancher shot him, inflicting serious injury. In a battery action brought by the neighbor against the rancher, the rancher testified that he actually thought his neighbor was armed, although he could point to nothing that would have reasonably justified this belief. Is the neighbor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the rancher was standing on his own property and had no obligation to retreat.\nB. No, because the rancher suspected that the neighbor was armed.\nC. Yes, because deadly force is never appropriate in a property dispute.\nD. Yes, because it was unreasonable for the rancher to consider the use of a gun necessary for self-defense.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. The rancher has a privilege to defend himself against what he reasonably believes to be a threat to his life or property, but he has no right to use deadly force. To justify the use of deadly force, the rancher must have more than a subjective suspicion that the neighbor is armed. The rancher must have actual knowledge of the neighbor's possession of a weapon, and that knowledge must be such that a reasonable person in the rancher's position would think it necessary to protect himself. In this case, the rancher's belief that the neighbor was armed was not reasonable, nor did he have a privilege to use deadly force, so the neighbor is likely to prevail. A is incorrect. The majority of states that recognize a right to stand one's ground and use deadly force for self-defense require that the actor be in his own property or that of a person he has a right to be there before he can claim the privilege. However, the rancher's right to stand his ground and use deadly force was not impaired by the fact that he was on his own land. Under the facts, the rancher had a privilege to use deadly force, but he was not entitled to use force with deadly consequences against the neighbor simply because he was on his land. C is incorrect. While deadly force is generally considered to be inappropriate in a property dispute, there are circumstances where the use of deadly force is appropriate. The rancher's belief that the neighbor was armed, and his reasonable belief that he was threatened with deadly force, would allow him to use deadly force in self-defense. D is incorrect.

However, in a defamation action that involves a matter of public concern--here, a claim brought by a candidate for public office--the plaintiff must establish more than mere damage to his or her reputation. The plaintiff must establish that the accusation is defamatory per se, which means that the accusation is so injurious that the plaintiff need not prove actual malice to prevail. Under defamation per se principles, the accusation that the candidate is an illegal drug user is defamatory because it calls into question the candidate's integrity and fitness for public office. As such, Answer C is incorrect. Under defamation per se principles, the accusation is defamatory, and the candidate need not establish that the editor acted with actual malice to prevail in his claim. Thus, Answer D is incorrect. Because the accusation is defamatory per se, the candidate need only establish that the editor published the accusation, and that the candidate suffered damage to his reputation. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. The assertion that the candidate is an illegal drug user is defamatory per se, and the candidate need not establish that the editor acted with actual malice to prevail in his claim.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n",

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. When the customer pledged the stock certificate as security for a loan, the bank accepted the pledge by taking possession of the certificate. By taking possession of the certificate, the bank acquired a lien on the stock. When the loan was repaid, the bank had a duty to return the stock certificate. The bank's refusal to return the stock certificate caused the customer to bring an action for conversion. Conversion is the wrongful taking and carrying away of the goods of another. In this case, the bank took possession of the stock certificate without the customer's permission and refused to return it when the loan was repaid. As such, B is the appropriate choice because it appropriately applies the conversion analysis to the facts and correctly calculates the amount the customer is entitled to recover. A is incorrect. The bank did not acquire the stock certificate by purchase or inheritance. The bank accepted the stock certificate as security for a loan, which is a contractual right. When the customer pledged the stock certificate, the bank had a duty to return the stock certificate when the loan was repaid. By refusing to return the stock certificate when the loan was repaid, the bank committed a wrong and the customer is entitled to bring an action for conversion. C is incorrect.

To prove proximate cause, the man must show that the pharmacy had a duty to exercise due care, the pharmacy's negligence was the cause in fact of the man's injuries, and the man would not have been harmed had the pharmacy exercised due care. Because the man offered no specific proof as to the pharmacy's negligence, B is the only possible answer. A is incorrect. Landsdowne v.

However, the facts of that case are distinguishable from the facts of this case because the patient in Lansdowne had taken the drug as directed and had suffered a reaction to the drug. In this case, the man took the pills as directed and suffered a heart attack. The active ingredient in the pills was associated with heart problems in overdose. The issue is whether the pharmacy acted with due care in filling the prescription. If it did, then the man has no claim. If it did not, then the man may prevail. C is incorrect.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landlord and a tenant orally agreed to a commercial tenancy for a term of six months beginning on July 1. Rent was to be paid by the first day of each month, and the tenant paid the first month\u2019s rent at the time of the agreement. When the tenant arrived at the leased premises on July 1, the tenant learned that the previous tenant had not vacated the premises at the end of her lease term on May 31 and did not intend to vacate. The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession. The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. By suing the previous tenant for possession, the tenant elected that remedy in lieu of a suit against the landlord.\nB. The landlord had delivered the legal right of possession to the tenant.\nC. The tenant failed to timely vacate as required to sue for constructive eviction.\nD. The tenant had not notified the landlord before bringing the eviction action.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The landlord tenant act that governs this situation is the landlord's, and it imposes a number of duties on the tenant. One of those duties is to give the landlord seasonable notice before the tenant brings an action for possession. In this case, the tenant did not give the landlord seasonable notice before bringing the action for possession, so the court will likely find for the landlord. A is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the tenant will likely lose, but it is incorrect because under the landlord tenant act, the tenant had a duty to give seasonable notice to the landlord before bringing the action. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the landlord will likely win, but it is incorrect because the landlord had no duty to deliver the legal right of possession to the tenant. The landlord had a duty, however, to give the tenant seasonable notice before the tenant could bring the action. C is incorrect.

The cousin then entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to an investor with the closing to take place \u201cone week after [the cousin\u2019s] next birthday.\u201d The man failed to convey the farm to the cousin on her birthday. One week after the cousin\u2019s birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin\u2019s inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise. The investor considered suing the cousin but realized that she could not compel the cousin to convey the farm because it was still owned by the man. Two weeks after the cousin\u2019s birthday, the man died. Under his valid will, the man devised the farm to the cousin. Within a week, the executor of the man\u2019s estate gave the cousin an executor\u2019s deed to the farm in compliance with state law. The investor promptly learned of this transfer and demanded that the cousin convey the farm to her. The cousin refused. The investor sued the cousin for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The cousin, because the contract to convey was not signed by the legal owner of the farm as of the date of the contract\nand was therefore void.\nB. The cousin, because she received title by devise rather than by conveyance.\nC. The investor, because the contract to convey merged into the executor\u2019s deed to the cousin.\nD.

However, the cousin had no claim against the investor because the investor had no duty under the contract to wait for the man to die before pursuing his remedies. The cousin's only recourse was to sue the man for breach of contract. After the man died, leaving the farm to the cousin in his will, the cousin had no interest to convey to the investor and thus had no obligation to do so.

After the mother\u2019s death and with the daughter\u2019s permission, the son took sole possession of the farm and agreed to pay the daughter a stipulated monthly rent. Several years later, the son defaulted on a personal loan, and his creditor obtained a judgment against him for $30,000. The creditor promptly and properly filed the judgment. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \u201cAny judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\u201d Six months later, the son died. There are no other applicable statutes. Is the creditor entitled to enforce its judgment lien against the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter became sole owner of the farm free and clear of the creditor\u2019s judgment lien when the son\ndied.\nB. No, because the son\u2019s interest was severed from the daughter\u2019s interest upon the filing of the lien.\nC.

Twenty years ago, the businesswoman conveyed the vacant tract to a grantee by a warranty deed that the businesswoman signed but the grantee did not. The deed contained a covenant by the grantee as owner of the vacant tract that neither he nor his heirs or assigns would \u201cerect any building\u201d on the vacant tract, in order to preserve the view of the river from the commercial building on the improved tract. The grantee intended to use the vacant tract as a nature preserve. The grantee promptly and properly recorded the deed. Last year, the businesswoman conveyed the improved tract to a businessman. A month later, the grantee died, devising all of his property, including the vacant land, to his cousin. Six weeks ago, the cousin began construction of a building on the vacant tract. The businessman objected and sued to enjoin construction of the building. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The businessman, because the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project.\nB. The businessman, because the cousin is bound by the covenant made by the grantee.\nC. The cousin, because an equitable servitude does not survive the death of the promisor.\nD.

A neighbor who owned the property immediately adjacent to the land wrongfully began to possess the land at that time. For 24 of the next 25 years, the neighbor planted and harvested crops on the land, hunted on it, and parked cars on it. However, in the sixth year after he first took possession of the land, the neighbor neither planted crops nor hunted nor parked cars on the land because he spent that entire year living in Europe. The neighbor built a small gardening shed on the land, but he never built a residence on it. When the daughter was 28, she was declared mentally incompetent and had a conservator appointed to oversee her affairs. Since then, she has continuously resided in a care facility. The applicable statute of limitations provides as follows: \u201cAn ejectment action shall be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues, but if the person entitled to bring the cause of action is under age 18 or mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues, it may be brought by such person within 10 years after attaining age 18 or after the person becomes competent.\u201d If the daughter\u2019s conservator wins an ejectment action against the neighbor, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter was age 17 when the neighbor first took possession of the land.\nB. Because the daughter is mentally incompetent, the statute of limitations has been tolled.\nC.

The buyer purchased a title insurance policy running to both the buyer and the bank, showing no liens on the property other than the buyer\u2019s mortgage to the bank. Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances. As a result of a title examiner\u2019s negligence, this mortgage was not disclosed in the title insurance policy issued to the buyer and the bank. Following this discovery, the donee successfully sued the buyer to recover the amount of the outstanding mortgage. If the buyer sues the title insurance company to recover the amount he paid to the donee, is he likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the buyer conveyed the land to an investor.\nB. No, because the title insurance policy lapsed when the buyer paid off the bank\u2019s mortgage.\nC.

For two years in a row after the woman died, the county assessor sent the tax bills to the niece, but the niece did not pay the bills, because she and the husband could not agree on who should pay them.

The woman recently defaulted on both loans. The bank promptly initiated foreclosure proceedings and sent proper notice to all necessary parties. The current fair market value of the four-acre lot is $250,000. The finance company has filed a timely motion in the foreclosure proceeding asking the court to require the bank to first foreclose on two of the four acres in the four-acre lot.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The principal of a public elementary school was prosecuted under the law for enrolling and providing education to several foreign nationals he knew to be in the country illegally. All of these actions took place before the new law was adopted. No federal statute applied to the principal\u2019s actions. What constitutional provision would be most helpful to the principal\u2019s defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The ex post facto clause of Article I, Section 10.\nD. The privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. The principal is arguing that the state law violates the Constitution of the United States. The ex post facto clause of Article I, Section 10, prohibits states from enacting any law that makes a crime retroactive. Although the principal\u2019s actions occurred before the state law was enacted, he is arguing that the law makes his actions illegal. For this reason, C is the appropriate choice. A is incorrect. The due process clause prohibits states from enacting or implementing laws that deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Since no state property is at issue here, the due process clause is not applicable. B is incorrect. The equal protection clause prohibits states from enacting or implementing laws that classify on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin. Since no classification is at issue, the equal protection clause is not applicable. D is incorrect. The privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects only United States citizens.

The university is accredited by the department of education of the state in which it is located. This accreditation certifies that the university meets prescribed educational standards. Because it is accredited, the university qualifies for state funding for certain of its operating expenses. Under this funding program, 25 percent of the university\u2019s total operating budget comes from state funds. A professor at the university was a part-time columnist for the local newspaper. In one of her published columns, the professor argued that \u201creligion has become a negative force in society.\u201d The university subsequently discharged the professor, giving as its sole reason for the dismissal her authorship and publication of this column. The professor sued the university, claiming only that her discharge violated her constitutional right to freedom of speech.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force.

A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

An applicant refused to answer the question and was denied bar admission on that basis. The applicant challenged the decision, arguing that the question infringed upon his freedom of association. Is the applicant likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because membership in a subversive group constitutes endorsement of the group's illegal activities.\nB. No, because the Constitution does not apply to the bar.\nC. Yes, because denying bar admission based on any association with a subversive organization violates the First\nAmendment.\nD.

On the first day the home was offered for sale, the homeowner gave a buyer a personal tour. The homeowner made no statements at all regarding the water damage or the roof. Without discovering the water damage or the leaking roof and without consulting a lawyer, the buyer immediately agreed in writing to buy the home for $200,000. Before the closing date, the buyer discovered the water damage and the leaking roof. The cost of repair was estimated at $22,000. The buyer has refused to go through with the purchase. If the homeowner sues the buyer for breach of contract, is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because no contract was formed since the buyer did not have a real opportunity to understand the essential terms\nof the contract.\nB. No, because the homeowner concealed evidence of the water damage and of the leaking roof.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The duty to disclose is implied in all contracts. The duty to disclose exists in order to prevent fraud and to prevent one party from suffering a loss caused by a mistake about a basic assumption of the contract. In this case, the buyer would not have entered into the contract had he known about the water damage and leaking roof. Because the buyer would not have entered into the contract without knowing about the damage, there is no contract. B is incorrect.

The bakery did all of its weekly bread baking on Tuesdays. On Monday morning of the first week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 8,000 pounds of flour to the bakery, and the bakery accepted it on the wholesaler\u2019s assurance that the remaining 2,000 pounds would be delivered later that evening, which it was. The bakery paid for both deliveries on Wednesday. On Monday of the second week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5,000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5,000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender. Was the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the bakery was legally entitled to reject any tender that did not conform perfectly to the contract.\nB. Yes, because the tender was a substantial impairment of that installment and could not be cured.\nC. No, because the tender was not a substantial impairment of the entire contract, and the wholesaler had given assurance\nof a cure.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under the terms of the contract, the bakery had the right to reject the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour if it was not delivered by 8:00 p.m. on Monday. However, because the wholesaler tendered the 5,000 pounds of flour by 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday, and the bakery had previously accepted the 8,000 pounds of flour on a Monday, the bakery would be in breach of the contract by rejecting the 5,000 pounds of flour. A is incorrect. The bakery had the right to reject the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour if it was not delivered by 8:00 p.m. on Monday, but it was not legally entitled to reject the tender simply because it did not conform perfectly to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, the bakery had agreed to pay for the flour on Wednesdays, and as long as the wholesaler tendered the 5,000 pounds of flour by 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday, the bakery would have a legal obligation to pay for it. C is incorrect. The tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour was not a substantial impairment of the entire contract. The contract requires the wholesaler to deliver 10,000 pounds of flour each week for 10 weeks, and the failure to deliver the 5,000 pounds on Monday would be a breach of the contract. However, the contract is not impaired, and the wholesaler is not in breach, simply because it tendered the 5,000 pounds of flour on Wednesday. D is incorrect.

The bookstore business, which was housed in a building that the aunt leased, was independently appraised at $200,000. The aunt decided to retire. She wrote to the niece, expressing her affection for the niece and offering to sell her the bookstore business for $125,000 if the landlord would agree to a transfer of the lease. The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt\u2019s offer. In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms. Before the attorney had finished drafting the document, the aunt changed her mind about selling the business and informed the niece of her decision. In an action for breach of contract brought by the niece against her aunt, is the niece likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the motivation for the transfer of the business was the aunt\u2019s affection for her niece, not the price.\nB. No, because the promised consideration was inadequate in light of the market value of the business.\nC. Yes, because the condition concerning the landlord\u2019s assent to the transfer of the lease was beyond the control of\neither party.\nD. Yes, because the document being drafted by the attorney was merely a record of an agreement already made, not a\ncondition to it.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one performance will take a period of time to complete, the other party can avoid the contract if the first party does not complete the performance before the other party has a reasonable opportunity to complete their performance. In this case, the landlord's assent to the transfer of the lease was set forth in the letter as a condition to the aunt's obligation to sell the business. Therefore, if the landlord did not assent to the transfer, the aunt would not have to sell the business and would be free to change her mind. A is incorrect. The aunt's promise to sell the business was not enforceable because the consideration offered by the niece was inadequate. Under the doctrine of exchange of promises, a party is entitled to only a return of what was bargained-for, and in this case, the niece's promise to pay the aunt $125,000 is not sufficient consideration for the aunt's promise to sell the business. B is incorrect. This is not a correct statement of the doctrine of constructive conditions. D is incorrect. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, the landlord's assent was set forth as a condition to the aunt's obligation to sell the business, but it was not a condition to the niece's obligation to pay the aunt $125,000.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n",

The offer contained no terms except those specifying the amount and quality of the cotton. The seller then sent an acknowledgment by fax. The acknowledgment repeated the terms of the buyer\u2019s offer and stated that shipment would occur within five days. Among 12 printed terms on the acknowledgment was a statement that any dispute about the cotton\u2019s quality would be submitted to arbitration. Neither the buyer nor the seller said anything further about arbitration. The seller shipped the cotton, and it was accepted by the buyer. A dispute arose between the buyer and the seller as to the quality of the cotton, and the seller asserted that the dispute had to be submitted to arbitration. The buyer instead sued the seller in court. In that suit, which of the following arguments best supports the seller\u2019s position that the buyer must submit the dispute to arbitration?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Arbitration is a more efficient method of resolving disputes than resolving them in court.\nB. The provision for arbitration did not contradict any term in the buyer\u2019s offer.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Under UCC \u00a7 2-207(2), a term in a confirmation is considered to be a proposal for addition to the contract. If the buyer accepts the shipment, then the term in the acknowledgment becomes a term of the contract. In this case, the term for arbitration is a proposal for addition to the contract. If the seller asserts that the buyer breached the contract by refusing to submit to arbitration, then the burden is on the seller to prove that the term for arbitration was a term of the contract. In order to meet this burden, the seller must show that the term for arbitration was set forth in the acknowledgment in a manner that contradicts a term in the buyer\u2019s offer. Since the term for arbitration was set forth in the acknowledgment in the same manner as the other terms, which were taken from the buyer\u2019s offer, the seller has failed to meet his burden. A is incorrect. While arbitration may be a more efficient method of resolving disputes, this is irrelevant if the buyer did not agree to submit the dispute to arbitration. C is incorrect.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The agreement is enforceable for the full year because the company has substantially performed its promise to buy, and the supplier has substantially performed its promise to sell. Under these circumstances, the non-breaching party can sue for breach of contract for the entire term of the agreement. B is incorrect. The company\u2019s promise to buy all of its lawn care products from the supplier does not, by itself, make the agreement enforceable. A promise to sell goods is not enforceable unless there is a sufficient basis to imply a term that the buyer will not be subject to a price increase after acceptance of the offer. Because the agreement does not contain such a term, the company would not have a claim for breach of contract if the supplier increased its prices after the company had accepted the offer by continuing to buy lawn care products from the supplier. C is incorrect. The supplier could not, and did not, revoke its offer. Under the terms of the agreement, the supplier reserved the right to increase the prices, which it did not do until after the company had accepted the offer by continuing to buy lawn care products from the supplier. D is incorrect. The absence of a minimum quantity term did not render the company\u2019s promise illusory.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nC is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one performance will take a period of time to complete, the non-occurrence of the other party's performance will discharge the contract if the non-occurring performance is subject to an express condition. However, if the non-occurring performance is not subject to an express condition, the other party is still obligated to perform, and the breach will be a material breach. A court will excuse the performance subject to a condition where its non-occurrence would impose a disproportionate forfeiture. Since the buyer would be required to pay the entire purchase price while the seller would only be obligated to convey the property if the buyer secured bank financing, the court will excuse the performance subject to the bank financing condition. B is incorrect. The contract does impose a duty on the buyer to apply for bank financing. Under the doctrine of implied conditions, where one performance will take a period of time to complete, the non-occurring performance will be subject to an implied condition that the other party has used reasonable efforts to complete its performance. The failure of the buyer to apply for bank financing will be a material breach of the contract and will entitle the seller to sue for breach. A is incorrect. The buyer's failure to secure bank financing will not be a material breach of the contract. D is incorrect. The court will not imply a term imposing a duty on the buyer to use reasonable efforts to secure bank financing.

But it would be really nice if you would sell me the family home for $100,000.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the mother. \u201cIt is worth a lot more than that\u2014at least $250,000.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the daughter. \u201cBut I have always been good and visited you, and my brother has never visited you, so that ought to be worth something.

Shortly thereafter, the mother died. When her son found out that the house had been sold and was not part of his mother\u2019s estate, he sued to have the contract avoided on behalf of the mother.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\nD is correct. The facts clearly indicate that the daughter unduly influenced her mother into signing the contract. The mother's statement that it would be \"really nice\" if her daughter bought her out of the house, and the daughter's threat that she would not visit her mother if she did not sell her the house are strong indications of undue influence. A is incorrect. There is no evidence that the daughter used any threat of force to get her mother to sign the contract. B is incorrect. There is no evidence that the daughter received any benefit from the contract other than the house. If the court finds that the contract was the product of undue influence, it will likely find that the consideration for the contract was not bargained-for. C is incorrect.

The borrower\u2019s January 10 statement was not a return promise, and therefore the lender effectively revoked his offer\non January 11.\nB. The January 10 telephone conversation between the lender and the borrower created an executory accord and therefore\ndid not operate as a discharge of the $50,000 debt.\nC.

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA cyclist sued a defendant corporation for injuries sustained when she was hit by a truck owned by the defendant and driven by its employee, who was making deliveries for the defendant.

However, the conversation is being introduced to prove the defendant's state of mind, and not to prove what was said. As such, the best evidence rule does not allow the testimony of the agent to be used in lieu of the audiotape. A is incorrect because, although the audiotape is the best evidence of the conversation, the best evidence rule does not require that the audiotape be authenticated or identified before the testimony of the agent can be used.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself.

The executive went home, but she returned that night to retrieve personal items from her office. When she discovered that her key no longer opened a door to the building, she forced the door open and went to her former office. To avoid attracting attention, she did not turn on any lights. In the dark, she knew that she was taking some items that were not hers; she planned to sort these out later and return them. Upon arriving home, she found that she had taken a record book and some financial papers that belonged to the firm. After thinking it over and becoming angrier over being fired, she burned the book and papers in her fireplace. The jurisdiction has expanded the crime of burglary to include all buildings. What crime(s) has the executive committed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Burglary and larceny.\nB. Burglary, but not larceny.\nC. Larceny, but not burglary.\nD. Neither larceny nor burglary.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The executive committed larceny when she took the firm's property and burglary when she entered the building with the intent to steal. The fact that the executive did not intend to take the specific items until later, and that she did not turn on any lights, will make no difference. A person is guilty of burglary if, with the intent to commit a burglary, he enters a building not his own. Larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of his interest in the property.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nA is correct. The man's statement should be suppressed because, under the circumstances, there was no reasonable belief that the man understood his rights and waived them, and the statement should be suppressed unless the man knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights. Before in custody statements can be used against a defendant, the police must give the Miranda warnings and determine that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights. In this case, the man was asleep when the police entered his house, and when he was awakened by the police, he asked \"what's going on.\" Clearly, the man did not know he was being arrested and was not aware of his rights. For these reasons, the statement should be suppressed. B is incorrect. The determination of whether a statement is voluntary does not require that the defendant be aware of his rights or that he have waived them. It is sufficient that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily made the statement. As stated above, A is the best argument for granting the motion. If A is not successful, B is the best argument.

Intending to cause her boss discomfort, the employee secretly dropped into his coffee three over-the-counter laxative pills. The boss drank the coffee containing the pills.

The man's motion is based on the claim that the agent's testimony before the grand jury violated the man's constitutional rights.

The agent's testimony before the grand jury consists of his observations of the man's conduct, statements, and activities, which are being used to prove that the man engaged in illegal gambling. As such, the agent's testimony is being offered for its truth, and if the testimony does not meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 1003, then the indictment should be dismissed. A is incorrect. Dismissal of the indictment is not the appropriate remedy because the motion is based on the claim that the agent's testimony violated the man's constitutional rights. Motions to dismiss an indictment for hearsay are premature; the man would have to make a motion to dismiss the indictment based on hearsay after a trial, if the hearsay is in fact admitted into evidence at trial.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA defendant was tried for armed robbery. The state introduced evidence that a man, identified by witnesses as the defendant, entered a convenience store at 11 p.m. on March 5, threatened the clerk with a gun, and took $75 from the cash register. The defendant did not testify, but his sister did. She testified that on March 5, at the time of the robbery, the defendant was with her in a city 300 miles away. On cross-examination, the sister admitted having given a statement to the police in which she had said that the defendant was not with her on March 5, but she claimed that the earlier statement was mistaken. The court instructed the jury that in order to convict the defendant, they had to find all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. As to the defendant\u2019s claim of alibi, which of the following additional instructions would be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Alibi is a matter of defense and so must be established by the defendant; however, the burden of persuasion is by a\npreponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.\nB. Before you may consider the defendant\u2019s claim of alibi, you must decide whether he has produced sufficient evidence\nto raise the issue.\nC. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was present at the convenience store at about 11 p.m. on\nMarch 5, you must find him not guilty.\nD. If the defendant\u2019s evidence has caused you to have a reasonable doubt as to whether he was the robber, you must find\nhim not guilty.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\nB is correct. Before the jury can even consider whether the defendant has established an alibi, they must first decide whether he has produced sufficient evidence to raise the issue. If the jury finds that the defendant has produced sufficient evidence to raise the alibi issue, then they must decide whether they have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was the robber. If they do have a reasonable doubt, then they must find the defendant not guilty. A is incorrect because, although an alibi is a matter of defense, the burden of persuasion is by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. Under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, if the jury does not have a reasonable doubt, then the defendant would be guilty. B is incorrect because, before the jury can consider the alibi issue at all, they must first decide whether the defendant has produced sufficient evidence to raise the issue. If the jury finds that the defendant has produced sufficient evidence to raise the alibi issue, then they must decide whether they have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was the robber. If they do have a reasonable doubt, then they must find the defendant not guilty. C is incorrect because, if the jury does have a reasonable doubt, they must find the defendant not guilty.

The defendant testified truthfully that the robbery had occurred on a dark night, that she had had no idea how old the victim was and had not cared how old the victim was, and that she had intended to rob whomever she encountered. Could the defendant properly be convicted of aggravated robbery of the elderly?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the only evidence on the issue showed that the defendant did not know, nor could she reasonably have\nknown, the victim\u2019s age.\nB. No, because there was no evidence of a substantial risk that the victim was age 65 or older.\nC.

The passenger offered to pay for the gas. While the passenger pumped gas, he was surprised to see the driver enter the station, take money from the unattended cash drawer, and get back in the car. The passenger paid the attendant for the gas, and the driver drove off. The driver offered to reimburse the passenger for the gas, but the passenger declined. After discovering the missing cash, the gas station attendant called the police, and the driver was later stopped. The driver escaped with the stolen money, however, and was never prosecuted. If the passenger is prosecuted for theft as an accomplice, should he be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because he had no intent to promote the commission of the offense.\nB. No, because the driver, the principal, was never prosecuted.\nC. Yes, because he facilitated commission of the offense by failing to make any effort to stop it.\nD.

Upon arriving at the house, the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious. An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine. After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana. The young woman has filed a motion to suppress the use of both as evidence on the ground that the entry into the house and the searches were made without a warrant. How should the court decide the young woman\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Grant it as to the cocaine, but deny it as to the marijuana.\nB.
