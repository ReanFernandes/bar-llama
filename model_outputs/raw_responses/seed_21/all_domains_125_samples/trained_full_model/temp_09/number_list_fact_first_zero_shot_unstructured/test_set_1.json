        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Civil_procedure\n2. Explanation: C is correct. To determine whether a case is outside the court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction, the court must first determine whether the parties are diverse. The court then must ask whether the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs. There must be complete diversity between the parties, which means that no two parties can be made up of members of the same class. In addition, the court must ask whether the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs. There is diversity when a party does not reside in the same state as another party, or when a party is not a citizen of the state where the other party is a citizen. Here, the car manufacturing company is a citizen of the state where it is incorporated and where it has its principal place of business. The shareholder is a citizen of a different state. Therefore, there is diversity because the shareholder is not a citizen of the same state as the company. However, the shareholder must also be able to show that the court can exercise complete diversity jurisdiction. That means that no two parties can be made up of members of the same class. Here, the company has multiple shareholders and the shareholder is not a member of any class. Therefore, the shareholder will not be able to show that the court lacks complete diversity jurisdiction. A is incorrect because a corporation is treated as a resident of the state where it is incorporated and where it has its principal place of business.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

The federal claim must not only be asserted against the defendant, it must also be a claim against the defendant that is necessarily part of the case. D is correct. The amendment adding the second defendant related back to the date of the original complaint because it did not ascertain new or different defendants, but instead added a defendant who should have been a party from the start due to the relationship with the first defendant.

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

The defendant travels to State A once each year for a weeklong vacation but has no other State A contacts. The defendant answered, denying all allegations. One week later, the defendant filed an amended answer, denying all allegations and including the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. State A has a long-arm statute that permits personal jurisdiction to the constitutional limit. The defendant has moved for an order dismissing the action based on the personal-jurisdiction challenge asserted in the amended answer. Should the court issue the order?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant waived the challenge to personal jurisdiction by failing to include it in her original answer.\nB.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Civil_procedure\n2. Explanation: A is incorrect. The defense of lack of personal jurisdiction must be timely raised. This requirement is waived if not included in the initial answer. However, the defense may be raised by amendment within 21 days after serving the amended answer. Therefore, the defendant's defense is timely raised and the court should consider whether State A has jurisdiction over the defendant. B is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require personal service when the defendant resides outside the state where the federal court is located. Service is permissive and may be effected by any of the means allowed under the state law, except that service on a defendant who resides outside the United States must be made under the law of the state where the court is located. Therefore, service is valid, but the court should still consider whether State A has jurisdiction over the defendant. C is incorrect. Minimum contacts are not necessary for personal jurisdiction to be exercised over a defendant who is not a resident of the forum state. However, the court should consider whether State A has jurisdiction over the defendant. D is incorrect.

Thus, the defendant timely asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after the original answer. Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants.

The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect.

Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect.

Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal.

Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow the amendment, but it is not dispositive. Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.",

The manufacturer\u2019s attorney proposed an instruction that the jury should not return a verdict for the consumer if it found that the consumer had been contributorily negligent.

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC. The court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law because he implicitly assumed the risk of the manager\u2019s carelessness.\nD.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Torts\n2. Explanation: A is correct. Because this is a negligence claim, the key issue is whether the friend impliedly assumed the risk of the manager\u2019s negligence by entering the loading dock after the driver had asked him not to go near the truck. When the friend ignored the driver\u2019s warning and entered the loading dock, he implicitly undertook the risk of the manager\u2019s negligence or, in this case, the possibility that boxes would fall on him. Therefore, the court should rule for the friend\u2019s claim as a matter of law because the assumption-of-risk doctrine bars any claim based on negligence. B is incorrect. It is true that the court should deny both motions, but the reason is not that the facts are too uncertain to be judged by a jury. Rather, the reason is that the assumption-of-risk doctrine bars the friend\u2019s claim as a matter of law. C is incorrect. It is true that the court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law, but the reason is not that a court would conclude that the friend was more at fault than the manager.

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit a plaintiff to dismiss a claim without a court order by filing a motion to dismiss before the defendant has moved for summary judgment.

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not permit a court to dismiss a claim without prejudice at the request of only one of the parties. D is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that an affidavit that supports a motion for summary judgment must be made by a party or someone who has personal knowledge of the facts.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice, consistent with the woman\u2019s goal of refiling the action at a later date. Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery.

Can the broker join the contract claim?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contract claim is governed by state law.\nB. No, because the parties are not diverse.\nC. Yes, because the contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim.\nD. Yes, because the contract claim is a permissive counterclaim.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Civil_procedure\n2. Explanation: A is incorrect. The question does not provide information regarding the federal question that is at issue in the case. The federal question could be anything from a violation of the securities laws to a violation of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Because the federal question is not provided, the counterclaim may be governed by state law or federal law, depending on the federal question that is at issue. B is incorrect. The question does not give the parties' incomes or the state where they reside. Without this information, the court cannot determine whether the case would meet the amount in controversy requirement. Therefore, the parties would not be required to submit to the jurisdiction of the federal court because the claim does not meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. C is correct. The counterclaim is not a compulsory claim because the investor does not have a duty to pay the broker unless the investor wins her case against the broker. Therefore, the broker cannot automatically add the claim to the lawsuit. D is incorrect. This answer suggests that the counterclaim is permissive because the broker does not have a legal obligation to pay the investor unless the broker wins her case against the investor. This is incorrect because the counterclaim is not a compulsory claim because the broker does not have a duty to pay the investor unless the broker wins her case against the investor.\n3.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Constitutional_law\n2. Explanation: B is correct. The statute is narrowly tailored to address a legitimate federal interest in protecting the public health and safety. Because the stimulant is boiled out of the weed, it would be difficult for Congress to regulate the possession of the tea by taxing it or otherwise regulating its sale. However, because the tea can cause paralysis and even death, Congress has a legitimate federal interest in regulating its possession. Therefore, the statute is constitutional. A is incorrect. The statute does not regulate the use or sale of drugs as such. Instead, it regulates the possession of a liquid that can be used as a drug. Because the object of the statute is public health and safety, the statute is not barred by the First Amendment even though it regulates the possession of a psychoactive substance. C is incorrect. The use of stoves and fuels in the boiling of the weed is not a sufficiently tenuous or incidental nexus with interstate commerce to justify application of the commerce clause. D is incorrect. In the aggregate, the impact of the deaths and cases of paralysis might not be great enough to justify application of the commerce clause, but one or more individual cases of death or paralysis caused by the tea probably would satisfy the requirement.

The fact that the statute is wasteful does not give the President the power to spend the funds on a different purpose.

A is incorrect because the tax clause of Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1 gives the states plenary power to raise revenue through taxation. B is incorrect because the tax was not paid from federal funds directly, but rather was paid from funds that had been reimbursed to the contractor by the federal government.

The fee for registration is nominal, and the commission has no discretion to deny a permit to a carrier that properly registers and pays the registration fee.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Dismiss the action, because the company is not a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Dismiss the action, because the resident has not proffered payment of any of his arrearage to the company and therefore has no right to continued water service.\nC.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Constitutional_law\n2. Explanation: D is correct. The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the actions of private companies when those actions involve a state or local franchise. A franchise is a license to use public property for a profit. This license is granted by the state or local government in exchange for payment of a fee, which in turn enables the government to raise revenue and to perform its functions. In this case, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. Although the sale may have been motivated in part by a desire to raise revenue, the city continues to have a significant enough stake in the reservoir that the facility can be said to constitute public property. Moreover, the city granted the company a franchise to operate the facility in exchange for a fee. Therefore, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the company's termination of the resident's use of the property. A is incorrect. The company is a private company, not a state actor. B is incorrect.

To obtain a license, a tutor is required to achieve a passing score on a state-administered exam in the tutor\u2019s area of specialty. On several occasions, an organization representing tutors licensed in the state has successfully lobbied against proposed legislation that would have eased the licensing requirement. An out-of-state tutoring company would like to conduct business in the state, but very few of its tutors are licensed by the state. The company has sued to challenge the law. Is the company likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nB.

In this case, the state interest is quality control. However, quality control is not a compelling state interest when balanced against the burden of having to get a license. Therefore, the state law is unconstitutional. A is incorrect because rationality alone does not justify a classification that treats out-of-state residents differently than state residents. B is incorrect because, though substantial relatedness also does not justify the classification, the law in this case lacks even a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.

The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts.

The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract.

The appraiser told the heir that he had no expertise in appraising art and recommended that she hire an art appraiser to value the painting. The heir, doubting that the painting was valuable, declined to follow the appraiser\u2019s advice and decided to sell the painting at a yard sale. She set the price at $100, assuming that this price reflected the painting\u2019s approximate value. A neighbor, who knew nothing about art, purchased the painting from the heir at the asking price.

A contract is enforceable unless one of the parties lacked the capacity to contract or was under some incapacity at the time the contract was made. A party may be incapable of contracting if that party did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the contract because of mental impairment or intoxication, or if the contract was unconscionable at the time that the parties entered into the contract, due to economic pressure or other circumstances. Unconscionability is generally presumed to arise in a contract involving a disparity in bargaining power or one that seeks to deprive a party of a fundamental legal right. D is correct. The heir and the neighbor both knew that the painting had significant value, and so the contract was not the result of a mistake as to basic facts. However, the parties\u2019 positions were very unequal, and the small purchase price of $100 bears no relationship to the painting's true value of over $900,000. Therefore, the contract is unconscionable and may be rescinded. A is incorrect. Even if the heir knew that the painting was only worth $100, she cannot enforce the contract unless the neighbor had the capacity to contract and entered the contract knowingly and voluntarily. B is incorrect. The neighbor had no expertise as to the painting\u2019s value, but even an inexpert party has the capacity to contract if the contract involves a low level of risk.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Contracts\n2. Explanation: B is correct. Although many obligations are subject to the satisfaction of a condition precedent, the failure of which excuses performance, a party's contractual obligation may be subject to a condition subsequent. A condition subsequent is an obligation that is subject to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a later event, and whose satisfaction is subject to the control of the party whose performance is subject to the condition. If the event occurs, the obligation will be due and the party whose performance is subject to the condition must perform. If the event does not occur, the party whose performance is subject to the condition is excused from performing, and the other party is released from any duty to perform. In this case, the engineer\u2019s obligation is subject to a condition subsequent because completion of the governmental approval process is a condition precedent to the developer\u2019s obligation to pay the engineer. The engineer\u2019s performance is due and the engineer is obligated to complete the approval process, because the county\u2019s actions excused the condition.

The express condition precedent in this case does not excuse the developer\u2019s obligation to pay unless the engineer fails to obtain the county\u2019s approval for the project. C is incorrect.

The firm nevertheless accepted the subcontractor\u2019s bid and demanded that it perform the electrical work on the plant, but the subcontractor refused.

Pursuant to the doctrine of promissory estoppel, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages in the amount of $15,000 (the difference between the bid of the subcontractor who didn\u2019t perform and the bid of the subcontractor who did perform). Although the subcontractor's bid did not contain a provision making it irrevocable, the subcontractor reasonably relied on the firm's bid when the subcontractor submitted its bid, and the subcontractor's bid created a reliance expectation on the part of the firm.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

The mere fact that the owner acted in bad faith when she did not respond to the buyer\u2019s email does not mean that the contract is forever lost. If the bad faith action amounted to a repudiation of the contract, however, it would terminate the contract. B is incorrect. The owner did not repudiate her contract with the buyer on March 4. Instead, the owner merely notified the buyer that she planned to sue him for breach of contract if he did not pay the purchase price by the scheduled closing date. C is incorrect. The buyer did not repudiate his contract with the owner either. On March 3, the buyer merely notified the owner that he might not be able to pay the purchase price by the closing date. D is correct. The buyer\u2019s failure to protect himself when he did not accept the owner\u2019s offer to enter into an option contract may be one of the factors considered in determining whether damages will be awarded to the owner for the buyer\u2019s breach.

In return for his daughter\u2019s promise to pay $300,000 to his nephew at the time of the father\u2019s death, the father executed and delivered to his daughter a quitclaim deed to the land. The daughter took possession of the land. Two years later, in a signed writing, the father directed his daughter to pay to a neighbor, at the father\u2019s death, $50,000 of the $300,000 that was to go to the nephew.

The father died, and his daughter has since refused to pay anything to either the nephew or the neighbor. The neighbor has sued the daughter for the $50,000. Is the neighbor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter did not consent to any modification of the contract she had made with her father.\nB. No, because the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his daughter, and the nephew\u2019s interest could not be modified without his express written consent.\nC.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Property\n2. Explanation: D is correct. The doctrine of after-acquired title applies to a transferor who executes a deed purporting to convey all his interest in a piece of property, but who subsequently acquires title to more interest in the property. After-acquired title allows the transferor to convey title to any interest he has acquired in the property, even if some of his original conveyed interest was not transferred. In a suit by a third party beneficiary (the neighbor) against the grantor (the father), if the grantor has acquired title to the property, then the grantor has the power to revoke his promise to the beneficiary if he so chooses, and answer D is correct. The father, who had only a quitclaim deed to the property at the time of his death, could convey his after-acquired title to his daughter at his death. Therefore, the father\u2019s modification of his daughter\u2019s promise to pay her nephew is enforceable, because the father had after-acquired title to the property at the time of his death. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because the grantor (father) had only a quitclaim deed to the property at the time of his death, and was thus not the owner of any interest in the property at the time he executed the deed to his daughter. Therefore, the modification that the father executed at the time of his death had no effect on his ownership interests, and answer A is incorrect. The deed conveyed to the daughter only her father\u2019s after-acquired title in the property, and the modification of her duty to pay her nephew had no effect on her ownership interest. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. The grantor was not the owner of any interest in the property at the time of the deed, and the modification of his daughter\u2019s obligation is irrelevant to his ownership interest.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere.

Although the general rule is that an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury, the standard for assessing whether an award is \"excessive\" violates the Seventh Amendment if it is not assessed by a judge, not a jury. Therefore, because the jury awarded the patient's heirs $21 million in punitive damages, the court will likely vacate the award because the Seventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from entering an award that exceeds twice the amount of actual damages.

D is incorrect. The patient\u2019s smoking cannot be used as a defense to eliminate all liability of the radiologist. Even if the patient\u2019s smoking was a contributory cause of death, the radiologist is still responsible for a portion of the damages, because the radiologist breached the standard of care.\n3.

An employee of the agency went to the buyer\u2019s home and knocked on the front door. When the buyer answered, the employee explained that he was there to repossess the car and asked for the car keys. The buyer handed the employee the keys but then asked the employee to allow her to retrieve her laptop computer from the car. The employee declined the request, explaining to the buyer that any possessions in the car could be reclaimed from the company after the car was repossessed. After pleading unsuccessfully with the employee, the buyer shoved the employee away from the door with such force that the employee fell and suffered a broken wrist. The buyer then ran to the car, which was unlocked, and retrieved the laptop. The employee has sued the buyer for battery. The buyer has moved for summary judgment, arguing that she was privileged to act as she did. Should the trial court grant the buyer\u2019s motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a fact-finder could reasonably conclude that the buyer used excessive force in attempting to defend her property.\nB. No, because after the buyer handed the keys to the employee, the car was no longer her property.\nC. Yes, because a possessor can use nonlethal force to protect his or her property.\nD.

A fact finder could not reasonably conclude that the buyer used excessive force. The force the buyer used was no more than necessary to keep the employee from taking her property. B is incorrect. The car was still her property even after she handed the keys to the employee. The keys merely served as evidence of her title. C is incorrect. The force the buyer used was not necessarily reasonable because the force the buyer used was roughly the same as the force the employee had used to push her.

As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

Frightened, a passenger pried the inside doors open and impulsively stuck his arm through them to try to stop the fall. As a result, his arm was broken. The elevator eventually stopped without causing further injuries. In a negligence action brought by the injured passenger against the company that installed and maintained the elevator, the injured passenger has asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that it may find the company negligent on a theory of res ipsa loquitur. In response, the company has argued that the passenger\u2019s conduct caused his injuries. How should the judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The judge should deny the passenger\u2019s request, because it is possible that the company was not negligent.\nB. The judge should deny the passenger\u2019s request, because the jury could find that the conduct of the passenger contributed to his injuries.\nC.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Torts\n2. Explanation: C is correct. When determining whether a party is entitled to a presumption under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the court must determine whether the accident would likely not occur in the absence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The passenger\u2019s action in reaching into the elevator car with his arm may show that the company was negligent in that the company would not have allowed a passenger to reach into the shaft if the car were not dangerously malfunctioning. However, a court will only grant the plaintiff the presumption, and will instruct the jury that they must also consider whether the defendant's negligence was a cause in fact of the plaintiff's injuries, and that the company's negligence was the proximate cause of his injuries. Therefore, answer C is correct. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect. When ruling on the company\u2019s request for a jury instruction on the theory of comparative negligence, the judge must also consider the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in determining how much, if any, of an award the company must pay. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. The judge should not grant the company\u2019s request for a jury instruction on comparative negligence because it is unlikely that the jury would find the passenger\u2019s actions to be a cause in fact or a proximate cause of his injuries. Answer D is incorrect because the passenger\u2019s actions must be evaluated in light of the circumstances. For example, if the passenger had reached into the shaft with a gun, the company could argue that his actions were a cause in fact and a proximate cause of his injury. However, the passenger\u2019s actions in reaching into the shaft with his arm when the elevator was in free-fall were reasonable, so the company would not prevail.\n3. Chosen Option Label: C\n",

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Torts\n2. Explanation: D is correct. In most jurisdictions, a defendant who owns or occupies land is liable for a guest's injury from a condition on the premises if the defendant had control of the premises and the guest was not there as a guest of the defendant. The defendant is not liable if the guest was there with the permission of the owner and with the understanding that the premises were not under the control of the defendant. The defendant is also not liable if the guest was there as an independent contractor. In a negligence action, if the defendant wins, judgment must be for the defendant, as assumption of risk is an affirmative defense. Therefore, the court must issue an instruction on assumption of risk if there is a defense of that kind. A is incorrect. The instruction is not a correct statement of the law regarding comparative negligence. The jurisdiction should be using a comparative negligence system that employs the pure comparative negligence rule (also known as the all-or-nothing rule) where the plaintiff can recover all of his damages, less the percentage attributed to his own fault, or nothing if his percentage of fault exceeds 100%. B is incorrect. If the defendant wins, judgment must be for the defendant, so the defendant does not need a defense instruction. C is incorrect. The man is not a licensee because he was a guest.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Torts\n2. Explanation: A is correct. To bring a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show that a defendant\u2019s actions intentionally or with reckless disregard for the consequences caused severe emotional distress in the plaintiff.

The amusement park's display of fireworks is a attractive nuisance that enticed children to enter the restricted area where the rocket malfunctioned and injured the spectator.

Battery is a general intent crime, and the amusement park's negligent or intentional conduct would provide the requisite mental state. C is incorrect. The amusement park is not a private party but a public attraction. Because the amusement park has attracted large crowds with its fireworks display, the park is performing a public function, which would negate the need for a nuisance action. D is incorrect. While strict liability can be used in place of negligence for ultra-hazardous activities, the Supreme Court has held that the performance of fireworks is not an ultra- hazardous activity.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC. It is not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in places that are visible to neighbors.\nD. Unsightly conditions ordinarily do not of themselves amount to an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of a neighboring property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Torts\n2. Explanation: D is correct. Private nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable interference with another's use or enjoyment of property. A defendant\u2019s activity may be a nuisance even if it does not cause any physical harm or damage to a plaintiff\u2019s property. The determination of whether an activity is a nuisance turns on whether the activity offends against ordinary decency, whether it unreasonably interferes with a plaintiff's use or enjoyment of life or property, and whether the nuisance is offensive or annoying to the plaintiff. While the farmer\u2019s placement of unsightly items may offend against ordinary decency and unreasonably interfere with the homeowner\u2019s use and enjoyment of her property, the fact that other local farmers place items in view of neighbors may indicate that the farmer\u2019s actions are not unreasonable, and thus are not a nuisance. Therefore, D is the best argument in favor of the farmer\u2019s defense. A is incorrect. While it may be true that the items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property, a nuisance is not limited to those injuries that have market value. B is incorrect. Physical encroachment is not required for a finding of private nuisance. However, the farmer\u2019s activity may not be a nuisance if other local farmers do not physically encroach on the views of their neighbors. C is incorrect. While it is true that the activity of other local farmers may indicate that the farmer\u2019s placement of items is not unreasonable, whether or not this is common knowledge in the community is irrelevant to the determination of whether the farmer\u2019s activity is a nuisance.\n3.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the contractor and the homeowner, because neither posted a warning that the porch boards had been loosened.\nB. Neither the homeowner nor the contractor, because the friend was a licensee.\nC.

No, because there is no testimony establishing that cell-phone technology produces accurate photographs.\nC. Yes, because the photograph will be authenticated by the witness\u2019s testimony.\nD.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Evidence\n2. Explanation: D is correct. The photograph is self-authenticating because it contains sufficient descriptive matter to identify itself accurately as a photograph and to identify the person who took it. Because the plaintiff's attorney will have the witness identify himself and the photograph, there is no need for the judge to instruct the jury that the photograph is self-authenticating. A is incorrect. Although the photograph has some probative value on the issue of whether the plaintiff was injured, the potential for unfair prejudice is not substantially outweighed by that value. The issue is a matter of credibility, and the jury might infer that the plaintiff is exaggerating her injuries or is maliciously trying to collect a claim from the defendant. Such an inference would be highly prejudicial to the defendant. B is incorrect. It is irrelevant whether the technology used to take the photograph is accurate or precise. The plaintiff's attorney will have the witness testify that the photograph accurately portrays what he saw. That testimony, in combination with the photograph, will be sufficient to authenticate the photograph. C is incorrect.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph \u201cis what the proponent claims it is.\u201d The witness\u2019s proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw it.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Evidence\n2. Explanation: A is correct. The woman\u2019s statement that the defendant was her cocaine supplier is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. As such, it is hearsay. However, it meets the requirements for the statement of a party opponent exception to the hearsay rule because it was a statement made by the woman when she was arrested and in the custody of the police officer, and it concerned the crime for which she was arrested. Therefore, the statement is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. B is incorrect. The statement is not within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Therefore, it is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements for any exception to the hearsay rule. C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement that the defendant was her cocaine supplier is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. As such, it is hearsay. However, it does not meet the requirements for the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule because the defendant and the woman were not participants in a common scheme or plan, and the statement was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy. D is incorrect. The statement is not within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Therefore, it is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements for any exception to the hearsay rule.

Answer C is incorrect. The woman\u2019s statement was made to a police officer following her arrest and not during a drug conspiracy with the defendant. The statement also certainly did nothing to further a drug conspiracy, even if one did exist. Answer D is incorrect. The portion of the woman\u2019s statement attributing fault to the defendant and suggesting that he was her drug supplier was not against the woman\u2019s penal interest.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Evidence\n2. Explanation: C is correct. Prior inconsistent statements, even if they are hearsay, can be used to impeach the testimony of a witness who was cross-examined about the statement. In addition, if the prior inconsistent statement was given under oath, it can be used as substantive evidence if the court finds that the witness\u2019s present testimony is not believable. The investigator\u2019s testimony that the witness told him that she did not see the plaintiff fall is admissible to prove that the witness did not see the plaintiff fall and to impeach the witness\u2019s trial testimony. A is incorrect. The testimony does not fit the hearsay exceptions for statements of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind or for prior inconsistent statements. Therefore, it is inadmissible as hearsay. B is incorrect. The witness\u2019s denial of the statement does not make the statement untrue.

The defense may offer extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for the limited non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness after the witness has been given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Answer A is incorrect. The witness\u2019s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose.

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception.

Four years later, the friend opened a tavern that sold alcoholic beverages on the property. Six months after the opening, while the friend continued to operate the tavern, the municipality in which the property is located validly condemned the property. There are no applicable statutes. To whom should the condemnation proceeds be paid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. To the friend and the grantor in equal shares, because they both had an interest in the property.\nB. To the friend, because he was in possession on the date of the condemnation.\nC. To the friend, because the limitation is an invalid restraint on the sale of alcohol.\nD.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Property\n2. Explanation: B is correct. Although the grantor and the friend both have an interest in the property, the grantor only holds a reversion. A reversion is a future interest that will only become possessory after the termination of a previous estate. In this case, the previous estate is the friend\u2019s estate of possession, which will terminate automatically when the friend sells alcohol on the property (whether he does so intentionally or not). The grantor\u2019s interest will become possessory automatically upon that sale. Therefore, B is the best answer. A is incorrect because the interests of the grantor and the friend are both subject to the termination of the friend\u2019s estate of possession. C is incorrect because the restriction on sale is enforceable against the friend whether he intends it to be or not. D is incorrect because the sale of alcohol did not cause the termination of the friend\u2019s estate of possession; rather, it was the condemnation that caused the termination.\n3.

The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot.

Although the mother may be estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser if she were to allow a three-story structure on her lot (which would defeat the purpose of the covenant and indicate that she does not intend to enforce it), there is no estoppel where an obligation is one that the law imposes upon the parties, rather than one that they have assumed by contract.

The scope of the agency created by the listing agreement was defined by the express language of the agreement, which made the broker the woman\u2019s sole agent for the sale of the property during the six-month period of the listing agreement. That scope of agency ended automatically at the end of the listing period, even if a buyer had been found by the broker. Because the woman did not revoke the agency or give a new one to another broker before the end of the listing period, the broker is entitled to the commission, whether or not she actually had any knowledge of the sale to the corporation. A is incorrect.

The friend agreed to lend the woman the entire purchase price if, immediately following the purchase, the woman would deed the land to him. This agreement created an equitable mortgage on the land in favor of the friend. An equitable mortgage does not need to be in writing or recorded, and it requires no formal approval from a court.

A is incorrect because the parties have not provided an appropriate basis for establishing a lease. In particular, the agreement that the woman have a ten-year period to pay and the agreement that the woman could live on the land do not make this a lease.

The woman wants to avoid the publicity of a foreclosure sale and protect her credit rating. The house is not encumbered by any other liens.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Property\n2. Explanation: C is correct. A mortgage is a lien on real property as security for an obligation that the owner of that property owes to the creditor (the lender). If the owner defaults on the mortgage, the lender has the right to foreclose on the mortgage. However, if the owner is able to make all mortgage payments that are due and payable for a period of at least six months, he has the right to avoid foreclosure completely and to retain his equity of redemption by making a written request to the lender. This request, known as a \"modification of mortgage,\" seeks to renegotiate the terms of the existing mortgage so that the owner can afford to make the payments that are due. Some lenders are receptive to these requests and will accept a deed from the owner in lieu of foreclosure if the owner is able to make the payments that are due for a period of at least six months. If the bank accepts the deed, it will receive unencumbered title to the property. Therefore, answer C is correct, and answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because residential foreclosure sales are not required by law, although the lender is entitled to select one of several permissible methods of foreclosure if the mortgage does allow for one.

The man\u2019s mother granted the bank a mortgage on a motel that she owned, but she did not sign a promissory note. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. Five years later, after real estate values had dropped considerably, the man defaulted on the loan from the bank. After acceleration, the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against both the commercial building and the motel owned by the mother. The mother timely objected to the foreclosure proceedings against the motel. The bank responded that it had the right to include both the commercial building and the motel in the foreclosure proceedings. Who is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because the motel was voluntarily mortgaged to secure the man\u2019s debt.\nB. The bank, because the mother is personally liable on any loan secured by the mortgage on the motel.\nC.

A mortgage must be executed and delivered by the debtor (the person who owes the money) to the lender (the creditor). In this case, the facts indicate that the mother, whose motel was given as security, did not sign a promissory note or mortgage. Without both, the bank has no evidence that the mother intended to convey title in the motel to the bank in the event of a default. Therefore, D is correct, and the bank does not hold an enforceable mortgage on the motel.

Therefore, the time for performance has arrived, and the doctrine of partition applies. Partition is the process of dividing the land so that each co-owner holds a separate title in an undivided one-half interest. Because the land is subject to a mortgage, the court will most likely order a partition by judicial sale of the land, with the proceeds being used to pay the mortgage and then the costs of the sale, and the remainder being divided equally between the co-owners.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Property\n2. Explanation: C is correct. Under the contract, the seller was only required to provide marketable title. In general, real property is considered marketable if there are no unresolved title defects, such as mortgages, restrictive covenants, easements, or other limiting provisions that are not explicitly identified in the contract. Where the contract calls for marketable title, but the seller fails to provide it, the seller is liable for damages to the buyer, which may include loss of bargain and legal expenses. However, a seller is not liable for failure to provide marketable title where the seller did not know of the defect at the time of the sale and where the defect could not reasonably have been discovered through a title search of the property. Because the buyer did not have actual knowledge of the restrictive covenant prior to entering the contract, and because the covenant would not have been discovered through a title search, the seller will not be liable for damages to the buyer. A is incorrect. Although the restrictive covenant did not render the title unmarketable, it does render the title unmarketable to the buyer, who has specific plans for how he will use the land. Therefore, the seller will not be liable for damages to the buyer, who will have a cause of action for specific performance. B is incorrect. Although the seller is required to provide marketable title, the term is construed in light of the specific circumstances of each case. In general, real property is considered marketable if there are no unresolved title defects, such as mortgages, restrictive covenants, easements, or other limiting provisions that are not explicitly identified in the contract.

The mortgage was promptly recorded. Six months later, the bank assigned only the promissory note to an investor. The assignment made no express reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The bank immediately sent the buyer a notice of the assignment, which provided the address of the investor and explained that the bank was no longer servicing the loan. The buyer made timely payments to the investor for two years but then defaulted on the loan. After the buyer failed to cure the default, the investor accelerated the debt and commenced a foreclosure action. The buyer\u2019s defense in the foreclosure action is that the investor is not the mortgagee and therefore has no right to foreclose. Does the investor have the right to foreclose?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mortgage did not automatically accompany the assignment of the note to the investor.\nB. No, because the mortgage was extinguished when the bank assigned and transferred only the note to the investor.\nC.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Property\n2. Explanation: C is correct. With an all-inclusive mortgage, when a lender executes a promissory note and a mortgage securing the note, the mortgage includes not only the property then offered as security, but also any later acquired title in the property through purchase or execution of a properly recorded deed. Further, the mortgage encumbers all of the interests of the lender, including any subsequently arising legal rights, title, and interest in the property. When the bank assigned only the note to the investor, the mortgage automatically went along with it, as an all-inclusive mortgage creates a lien on the property for both the note and the mortgage, and that lien will attach to any subsequent assignee of the note. Therefore, the investor has the right to foreclose. A is incorrect because even if the mortgage did not automatically accompany the note, the mortgage was assigned to the investor along with the note. B is incorrect because the mortgage was not extinguished when the note was transferred to the investor. An assignment of a mortgage does not require that the note also be transferred.

After the three men arrived, the supplier fired two shots at the lookout, who fell to the ground. Both the supplier and the dealer believed that the lookout was dead. The dealer subsequently pushed the lookout\u2019s body off a nearby cliff. Unbeknownst to the supplier and the dealer, the lookout had been wounded by the bullets but was not dead; he died as a result of the fall from the cliff.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation: B is correct. The question does not give a specific jurisdiction, but under the law of most states, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Murder is not a specific intent crime; rather it requires proof of malice, which can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied in actions that show gross recklessness toward human life. In this case, the supplier, believing the lookout was dead, helped the dealer push the lookout off a cliff. By doing so, the supplier showed gross recklessness toward human life and, thus, implied malice aforethought in his actions. A is incorrect. It is true that the actions in the question did not occur as part of a single scheme or plan, but malice can be implied in actions that show gross recklessness toward human life. Thus, the fact that the killing did not occur as part of a single scheme or plan is irrelevant. C is incorrect. The disposal of the body was part of the original plan if the plan was to make the killing look like a murder by a rival gang. However, if the plan was to kill the lookout but conceal the evidence by disposing of the body, the disposal of the body would not be part of the original plan. Because malice can be implied in actions that show gross recklessness toward human life, the answer does not hinge on whether the disposal of the body was part of the original plan. D is incorrect because, although the supplier believed the lookout was dead, he still had no intent to kill the lookout. The supplier believed the shots would only inflict great bodily harm upon the lookout.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n",

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement. Under the applicable statute, the degree of the crime (and, hence, the severity of the authorized punishment) depends upon the value of the property embezzled. Of what crime, if any, could the woman properly be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Embezzlement of $200,000.\nB. Embezzlement of $100,000.\nC. Embezzlement of $80,000.\nD. No embezzlement crime.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation: D is correct. The woman is charged with embezzlement of the $200,000 in proceeds she received from the sale of the stock. However, she is not guilty of embezzlement because she did not convert the proceeds of the sale. The woman, as trustee, had a fiduciary duty to hold the funds for the benefit of the trust. She had access to the proceeds because she had the duty to invest the funds, but she had an obligation to keep a record of her transactions as trustee and to make proper investments. She failed to do so, but that failure is not a crime because there was no conversion of trust funds to her personal use. A is incorrect. It is debatable whether the sale of the stock was a complete conversion of the original $200,000 to the woman's personal use. If it was not, the woman would be guilty of embezzlement of $200,000. However, as stated above, there was no conversion of trust funds to the woman's personal use. B is incorrect. The woman is charged with embezzlement of the $200,000 in proceeds she received from the sale of the stock. However, she is not guilty of embezzlement because she did not convert the proceeds.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled. Answer D is incorrect because the woman did embezzle $100,000; see the explanation for answer B.",

After the party was over, she got into her car and sped off. While driving 70 mph in a 30-mph zone, she struck and killed a pedestrian. Blood tests revealed that her blood alcohol content had been more than twice the legal limit at the time of the accident. The woman was tried for murder. At the close of the evidence, the court refused to dismiss the murder charge but offered to give a lesser-offense instruction. What lesser-offense instruction should the defense attorney request?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Depraved-heart homicide.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary intoxication.\nD. Voluntary manslaughter.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation: B is correct. At common law, intoxication could be the basis for a defense to a specific intent crime if the intoxication negated the requisite mens rea of the offense. For example, if a defendant was charged with burglary for breaking and entering a house with the intent to commit a felony therein, and the defendant was so drunk that he did not know he was breaking and entering, he could successfully defend himself to the burglary charge by asserting that he was too intoxicated to have the intent to commit a felony in the house. The defendant's intoxication negated the intent required for burglary. At common law, intoxication could also be a defense to a crime if it negated the requisite actus reus of the offense. For example, if a defendant was charged with battery for causing an offensive touching, and the defendant was so drunk that he did not know he had touched the victim, he could successfully defend himself to the battery charge by asserting that he was too intoxicated to have intentionally caused the touching. His intoxication negated the intent required for battery. At common law, intoxication could also be a defense to a crime if it negated the requisite mental state of the offense. For example, if a defendant was charged with robbery for taking the victim's property by force or threat of force, and the defendant was so drunk that he did not know he was taking the property of another, he could successfully defend himself to the robbery charge by asserting that he was too intoxicated to have the intent to take the victim's property. His intoxication negated the intent required for robbery. However, each of these common law defenses requires that the intoxication not be the result of self-induced intoxication. A defendant who voluntarily became intoxicated cannot take the intoxication as a defense to a specific intent crime, because the intoxication is not the result of an unintentional circumstance but rather is the result of the defendant's intentional actions. In this case, the woman voluntarily became intoxicated and should be held criminally responsible for her actions. Therefore, no lesser-offense instruction should be given, because there is no available defense to the charge of murder. A is incorrect. At common law, intoxication could be a defense to a specific intent crime if the intoxication negated the requisite mens rea of the offense. However, each of these common law defenses requires that the intoxication not be the result of self-induced intoxication",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. Defense counsel should request an instruction on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. On the facts described, a jury could potentially conclude that the woman did not act with the sort of aggravated recklessness necessary to constitute depraved-heart homicide or extreme-indifference murder, even though she was intoxicated and driving in an unlawful manner. Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself. Even if understood as the offense of \u201cpublic intoxication,\u201d this offense would be a poor choice because public intoxication is not a lesser included offense of murder. Answer D is incorrect. The facts do not suggest that the woman intended to kill the pedestrian. Neither do they suggest any sort of provocation.",

Federal prosecutors charged the defendant with aggravated theft for stealing computer equipment from a store on a federal military base. Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft. The prosecution objects, arguing that the court should only instruct on the charged offense of aggravated theft. Upon the defense attorney\u2019s request, should the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution.\nB. No, because the value of the stolen computer equipment is only a sentencing factor and not an offense element.\nC. Yes, because a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses.\nD.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation: A is incorrect. Although it is true that a court cannot instruct on an offense not charged by the prosecution, simple theft is a lesser included offense of aggravated theft. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s defense attorney is correct in arguing that the court should instruct on simple theft. B is incorrect. The value of the stolen property is an element of the offense of aggravated theft under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that the value of the stolen property is only a sentencing factor. C is incorrect. Although it is true that a court must instruct on all lesser included offenses, simple theft would not be a lesser included offense of aggravated theft if the stolen property had to be worth more than $1,000. However, because the stolen property in this case was worth less than $1,000, simple theft is a lesser included offense of aggravated theft. D is correct. Because simple theft is a lesser included offense of aggravated theft, the trial court should instruct the jury on simple theft. The prosecution does not need to prove that the property was worth more than $1,000 to obtain a conviction for aggravated theft; rather, the prosecution only needs to prove that the property was worth more than $1,000 as an element of the offense, and the jury could rationally find the defendant not guilty of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser included offense.\n3.

To determine whether the man was serious, an undercover officer introduced himself to the man at a bar. The officer said that he had previously taken care of problems for angry spouses. After some discussion in which the man expressed his extreme anger at his ex-wife, the man offered the officer $5,000 to kill her. The officer agreed and made arrangements to meet the man at the bar the next day to collect the $5,000 payment. When the man showed up the next day at the bar, authorities immediately arrested him.

Misprision of a felony.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation: B is correct. At common law, an attempt is an act done with the intent to commit a crime where the act falls short of the full commission of the crime. Here, the man had the intent to commit murder, and took a substantial step toward commission of the crime (offering to pay the officer $5,000), but did not commit murder because the killing was not foreseeable by the defendant and was not within his control. Thus, attempt is the most serious crime of which the man can properly be convicted. Bilateral conspiracy is punished as attempt. Therefore, answer B is correct. A is incorrect. Murder is the most serious crime of which the man can properly be convicted, but it was not the crime that the man intended to commit. Thus, attempted murder is not the most serious crime of which the man can properly be convicted. C is incorrect. Solicitation is a less serious crime than attempt. It requires only that the defendant encourage another to commit a crime, and does not require that the defendant have the intent that the crime be committed. In this case, the man did not intend to have his ex-wife murdered, so he cannot properly be convicted of solicitation of murder. D is incorrect. Misprision is a less serious crime than attempt. It requires that the defendant have knowledge that a crime has been committed and that he conceal that knowledge from the authorities. In contrast, attempt requires proof that the defendant have the intent that the crime be committed, and take a substantial step toward commission of the crime. Because misprision is a less serious crime than attempt, it cannot be the most serious crime of which the man can properly be convicted.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n",

Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony.

        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation: A is correct. The woman can be convicted of murder, based on malice aforethought. At common law, malice aforethought is not a specific intent. However, if the defendant's actions show gross recklessness toward human life, it may be implied that the defendant had intent to kill. In addition to the common law requirements, in most jurisdictions, malice aforethought requires that the defendant's actions cause the victim's death. B is incorrect. Based on the facts provided, voluntary manslaughter cannot be the most serious offense of which the woman can be properly convicted. While the woman's actions would support a finding of extreme emotional distress, that is an element of involuntary manslaughter, not voluntary manslaughter. In addition, voluntary manslaughter requires that the defendant have a reasonable provocation for the killing. There is no indication that the woman was provoked by the driver. C is incorrect. Involuntary manslaughter cannot be the most serious homicide offense of which the woman can be properly convicted. At common law, involuntary manslaughter requires that the defendant commit an act that would ordinarily not cause death, but which, through gross negligence or recklessness, causes death. The woman, while she may have been guilty of reckless driving, did not act with gross negligence or recklessness toward human life, which is required for a conviction of involuntary manslaughter. D is incorrect. There are four ways in which the woman can be convicted of a homicide offense. First, the woman can be convicted of murder, based on malice aforethought. Second, the woman can be convicted of voluntary manslaughter, based on causing the driver's death by the operation of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Third, the woman can be convicted of involuntary manslaughter, based on her reckless driving that caused the accident which resulted in the driver's death. Fourth, the woman can be convicted of vehicular homicide. In jurisdictions without a death penalty, vehicular homicide is generally punished as a felony.\n3. Chosen Option Label: A\n",

On these facts, a jury could rationally find both that the woman was guilty of reckless driving and that her illegal conduct caused the truck driver\u2019s death. The woman\u2019s conduct constitutes involuntary manslaughter under a theory of \u201cmisdemeanor-manslaughter.\u201d Answer A is incorrect. The woman could be guilty of murder on a theory of malice aforethought only if she intended to kill the driver. But the facts do not remotely suggest that the woman had that intent. The facts also do not support any theory of imputed malice, such as felony murder or depraved indifference. Answer B is incorrect because the woman did not intend to kill the driver and thus cannot be guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Answer D is incorrect because a jury could rationally convict the woman of involuntary manslaughter.",

Under state law, police are required to obtain DNA samples from all persons arrested for felonies and to store those samples in a state registry. The police informed the defendant of the state law and said that they would be using a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample from him. The defendant did not object. The defendant was later acquitted of burglary. A year later, however, authorities matched the defendant\u2019s DNA to an unsolved sexual assault crime. The defendant, now charged with sexual assault, has moved to suppress the DNA sample as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court suppress the DNA sample?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant failed to lodge a timely objection to the sample collection.\nB. No, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nC. No, because the statute violates the Fourth Amendment, but the police acted in good-faith reliance upon it.\nD. Yes, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees violates the Fourth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n    \n1. Chosen Domain: Criminal_law\n2. Explanation: B is correct. The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the state. The amendment does not apply to private citizens, only to the state. Therefore, it is not violated when a private citizen agrees to provide a DNA sample. A is incorrect. The defendant would not have had to lodge a timely objection for the sample to be suppressed. The motion to suppress was timely filed in the sexual assault case, which is the only case in which the suppression of the DNA sample would be relevant. C is incorrect. good-faith reliance on a valid statute is not a sufficient reason to exclude the evidence. D is incorrect. The Fourth Amendment does not apply to the state's collection of the defendant's DNA.\n3. Chosen Option Label: B\n",

He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD.

            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
