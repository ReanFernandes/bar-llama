            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction.

Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Although a request for waiver of service was sent, the defendant was not obligated to and did not respond to the request. Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

Several other passengers have also brought individual actions in State B federal court against the same railroad. The railroad has moved the State A court to transfer the action to the State B court. State B has only one federal court district.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder the federal venue statute, a district court may transfer a case to another district where it is in the interest of justice to do so. When a district court transfers a case to another district, it remains in the original district and the transferred case is assigned to the judge who would have been assigned the original case. Transfer is appropriate when a district court finds that a case could have been brought in the other district and that transfer would serve the interests of justice. Common questions of fact with similar actions pending in the other district are a significant factor in supporting transfer.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the accident occurred in State B, many witnesses are located there, and several other passengers have brought individual actions against the same railroad in State B federal court, transfer of the passenger's action to the State B court would serve the interests of justice.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

With the complaint, the US Attorney moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to \u201cenjoin any blockade of the base\u2019s entrance or other disruption of base activity until the court can hear motions for a preliminary and a permanent injunction.\u201d The US Attorney attached an affidavit certifying the unsuccessful efforts she had made to locate the organization and its leader and to notify them of the motion.

The organization and leader are seeking to halt the protests through a temporary restraining order (TRO) before a full hearing on a preliminary and permanent injunction. The US Attorney has made efforts to locate the organization and leader but has not been able to serve them with the complaint.\n\n### Rule application\nAccording to federal law, a court can grant a TRO if it finds that damages will be inadequate and that a party will suffer imminent and irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted.

The consumer's attorney did not object before the judge gave the instruction, but did object after the jury began deliberations.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party may object to a judge's instruction before the jury begins deliberations.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC.

In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim.

Therefore, the correct verdict would be that the writ is valid, supporting option D.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A landowner contracted in a signed writing to sell Greenacre a 500-acre tract of farmland to a farmer. The contract provided for exchange of the deed and purchase price of $100000 in cash on January 15. Possession was to be given to the farmer on the same date. On January 15 landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30 the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. Throughout the month of January the market value of Greenacre was $1010000 and its fair monthly rental value was $100000. On January 30 the farmer accepted a conveyance and possession of Greenacre and paid the $10000000 required by the contract. If the farmer sues the landowner on January 31 for breach of contract which of the following will the farmer recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $10000000 in damages because the farmer has been deprived of the beneficial use of the land for a month.\nB",

The statute authorizes the President to appoint the agency\u2019s director with the advice and consent of the Senate and prohibits the President from removing the director without the Senate\u2019s consent. The President appointed a director, and the Senate confirmed the appointment. Recently, the President has become dissatisfied with the director\u2019s strict approach to drug-law enforcement and wishes to remove the director. Because a majority of senators favor strict drug-law enforcement, the Senate has refused to consent to the director\u2019s removal. May the President constitutionally remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director\u2019s appointment and removal.\nB. No, because the President\u2019s removal of principal officers of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\nC.

He built the cabin in a location where avalanches occasionally occur. The landowner had taken reasonable precautions to make the cabin avalanche-proof, but avalanches sometimes occur in the area even though they have not occurred for many years. Recently, an avalanche occurred in the area and the debris from the avalanche dammed a stream flowing near the cabin. The dam created a lake that threatened the cabin. The landowner took additional precautions to make the cabin avalanche-proof, but they would have been impossible to take without substantial destruction of the cabin. The landowner then notified the state, which owns the stream, that the landowner would not be responsible for any damages caused by avalanches. There is no applicable state statute. Is the landowner liable for damages caused by the avalanche?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because avalanches are a risk of the location.\nB.

A series of Supreme Court cases beginning with Myers sharply limits Congress\u2019s ability to impose conditions on the removal of federal officials.   Answer B is incorrect. Myers and subsequent cases make it clear that the Senate has no role in the removal of federal officers other than via impeachment. Answer D is incorrect because it is an overbroad statement of the law. The Supreme Court has upheld the power of Congress to remove certain types of federal officials, such as those serving as members of the governing bodies of regulatory agencies and inferior officers in agencies where the head of the agency is removable by the President at will.",

Under this test, a state law is valid if it is applied to interstate commerce and is not undue burden on interstate commerce, and if it is the least restrictive means of serving a state\u2019s compelling interest in highway safety.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the registration and permit requirements are applied to both intrastate and interstate carriers and are the only prerequisites for issuing a permit, they meet the requirements for a least restrictive means of serving a state\u2019s compelling interest in highway safety. Therefore, the requirements are likely constitutional.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man entered into a valid written contract to purchase Blackacre, which was the subject of a mortgage securing a debt the man owed to a woman.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard.

He desired to develop the entire tract as a golf course, country club, and residential subdivision. He therefore proposed to devote 1,000 acres to the golf course and country club, and to sell the remaining 500 acres as residential lots. He contemplated forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club. The price of the 1,000 acres was intended to return enough money to compensate the landowner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and country club), and promotion expenses, and to create a sufficient surplus to provide for future maintenance, improvements, and debt service. The price of the 500 acres was intended to return enough money to compensate the landowner for the raw land and development costs, less the profit to be made on the 1,000 acres. The 500-acre lots would be sold at prices that would return enough money to compensate the landowner for the raw land and development costs, less the profit to be made on the 1,000 acres.

Under UCC \u00a7 2-206, an offer made by an order of goods may be accepted by the shipment of goods or by a prompt promise to ship. Here, the shipment of the laptops constituted the manufacturer\u2019s acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer and the terms set forth in the offer. Answer A is incorrect. The manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops was a reasonable mode of acceptance and gave rise to a contract. Answer B is incorrect. The retailer\u2019s order constituted an offer, and a contract was formed when the manufacturer shipped the laptops. Therefore, the exclusion of consequential damages in the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment constituted a request to modify that contract. The exclusion would become a term of the parties\u2019 agreement if the retailer assented to it, which did not occur here.   Answer D is incorrect. This response assumes that the parties formed a contract under UCC \u00a7 2-207(3) by their conduct.

The plumber demanded payment of the invoiced amount. Which of the following describes the compensation the plumber is entitled to receive from the homeowner?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Compensation based on the reasonable value of the plumber\u2019s services, because in the absence of an agreement on price, a reasonable price will be supplied.\nB.

The homeowner later refused to pay the full invoice amount, citing higher rates charged by other local plumbers. The homeowner offered to pay a lower amount based on the average of those rates. The plumber demanded payment of the invoiced amount.\n\n### Rule application\nIn the absence of a specific agreement on price, the parties' contract would be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which states that the parties may agree on any price or payment term.

The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value.

The store was owned by a man, and the woman was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the man's property.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

However, the written contract omitted the provision regarding the discounted rate for excess hours. The landlord recently requested the company to perform more than 100 hours of services in a month due to several snowstorms. The company insists on being paid at the contract rate of $150 per hour for all services.\n\n### Rule application\nA contract is valid if formed by mutual agreement and supported by adequate consideration. The landlord's promise to pay the company at the contract rate for all services in excess of 100 hours per month is adequate consideration for the company's promise to perform those services.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the parties had a valid, enforceable contract for all services at a rate of $150 per hour, reformation of the contract to reflect a discounted rate would be unnecessary. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The parties have a valid, enforceable contract that will be reformed to reflect the discounted rate of $125 per hour for services in excess of 100 hours.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man decided to steal a car he saw parked on a hill. When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man's conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because the instruction was a correct statement of the law.\nC. No, because the instruction wrongly described the necessary mental state.\nD. No",

The former employee's actions caused harm to the established cemetery by leading to the cancellation of existing contracts.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the former employee knew that some purchasers would take the offer and cancel their plans with the established cemetery, promoting the new cemetery and offering a $100 rebate on a pre-need funeral plan, the former employee intended to interfere with the established cemetery's contracts. The established cemetery has established a prima facie case of tortious interference with contract, and the former employee's motion for summary judgment should be denied.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A defendant was prosecuted for arson.

The jury found that the man was 25% responsible for the incident, and that each of the other defendants was also 25% responsible.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder pure contributory negligence jurisprudence, the man would not be able to recover damages from any of the defendants since he was also found to be 25% at fault.

Frightened, a passenger pried the inside doors open and impulsively stuck his arm through them to try to stop the fall. As a result, his arm was broken. The elevator eventually stopped without causing further injuries. In a negligence action brought by the injured passenger against the company that installed and maintained the elevator, the injured passenger has asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that it may find the company negligent on a theory of res ipsa loquitur. In response, the company has argued that the passenger\u2019s conduct caused his injuries. How should the judge rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The judge should deny the passenger\u2019s request, because it is possible that the company was not negligent.\nB. The judge should deny the passenger\u2019s request, because the jury could find that the conduct of the passenger contributed to his injuries.\nC. The judge should grant the passenger\u2019s request but should also instruct the jurors to consider any carelessness of the passenger in awarding damages if they find the company liable.\nD.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the contractor and the homeowner, because neither posted a warning that the porch boards had been loosened.\nB. Neither the homeowner nor the contractor, because the friend was a licensee.\nC.

The contractor, aware of the loose boards, proceeded to walk on them and fell through, resulting in injury.\n\n### Rule application\nPosting of a warning is an affirmative defense in premises liability cases. A property owner is not liable for a visitor's injuries if the owner has taken reasonable steps to warn against the condition that caused the injury. Conversely, a visitor is not liable for another visitor's injury if the visitor who was negligent in not heeding the warning.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the homeowner loosened the porch boards in a manner that created a dangerous condition but did not post a warning, the contractor's negligence in failing to heed the warning is not a bar to liability.

The prosecutor responded that the defendant had forfeited both objections by killing the rival.\n\n### Rule application\nGenerally, a party cannot invoke a particular constitutional protection if they have a significant opportunity to establish the same protection through other means. In the context of witnesses, this is known as the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' doctrine. By killing the rival, the defendant effectively prevented him from testifying against them in court. This means that any statements the rival made to the police are inadmissible as evidence under the Confrontation Clause.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the defendant killed the rival before he could testify in court, the defendant has forfeited his Confrontation Clause objection. As for his Hearsay objection, it is not clear if the prosecutor has established forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence since this requires a showing that the defendant killed the rival to keep him from testifying against them in court.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying. Here, the defendant\u2019s purpose for his wrongful conduct (killing the declarant) was revenge for a theft and not a desire to prevent trial testimony. Therefore, the prosecutor cannot make the showing of intent required for forfeiture of either objection. Answers A and B are incorrect for the reasons set out above.   Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The defense attorney should have immediately objected when the witness related inadmissible hearsay. An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103. In addition, the delayed objection failed to preserve the right to appeal, because the defense attorney did not state a specific basis for the objection under FRE 103. Answer A is incorrect. Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103. Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect. An objection must be made at the earliest opportunity under FRE 103, and an objection that is made \u201cduring trial\u201d but not while the witness is still on the stand is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.",

The defense may offer extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for the limited non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness after the witness has been given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Answer A is incorrect. The witness\u2019s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose.

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness.

Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

The defendant objects to its admission.\n\n### Rule application\nHearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. There are several exceptions to the hearsay rule, including the past recollection recorded exception. This exception allows for the admission of a statement that was previously made by a witness while the witness was remembering past facts.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the newspaper story is a statement made by a witness (the newspaper) while remembering past facts (the content of the story), it satisfies the requirements of the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect. Because the newspaper story is not offered for its truth, but rather to demonstrate notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy, it is not hearsay, and no hearsay exception is required for its admission.

Each conveyance was by a deed of gift containing a covenant specifying that only one single-story home could be constructed on the conveyed lot in order to preserve views of a nearby lake from the mother\u2019s lot. The deeds were promptly recorded. The mother then constructed a large three-story house on her lot.

The son later conveyed his lot to a purchaser, who began construction of a three-story house.

Lastly, they agreed that during the 10-year period the woman could live on the land. The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. At the end of the 10th year and after the loan had been repaid, the woman demanded that the friend deed the land back to her. The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB.

The deed to the friend did not refer to their agreement. After 10 years of loan repayments, the woman demanded the land back from the friend, who refused, claiming ownership.\n\n### Rule application\nAccording to the doctrine of merger, contract provisions are merged into the deed upon its execution.

The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

The deed was not recorded. The woman later sold the land to the buyer, who had no actual notice of the easement. After taking possession of the land, the buyer attempted to use the easement, but the man blocked the way with a chain-link fence. The buyer then sued the man to establish her right to use the easement.\n\n### Rule application\nAn easement appurtenant is a right that runs with a landowner's property and is limited to the landowner's use. An easement in gross is a right that runs with a single person and is not limited to any particular piece of land. Based on these definitions, an easement in gross would be more appropriate for a right-of-way over another's land.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the easement was granted to the woman and her heirs and assigns, it is likely that it was an easement appurtenant. If this is true, then the buyer would likely prevail since an easement appurtenant runs with the land and is not limited to any particular person. On the other hand, if the easement was an easement in gross, then it would not be available to the buyer since it was not tied to her particular land.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man and his friend were arrested for holding up a gas station.

An easement appurtenant may be granted by purchase or by gift. Answer C is incorrect. The buyer did purchase the land without any type of notice, but this is not a reason for the man to prevail. The easement is for the benefit of whoever owns the land. The buyer can still assert her right to the easement appurtenant because the easement has not terminated.   Answer D is incorrect.

After a title search, the buyer discovered the restrictive covenant and refused to close, citing unmarketable title.

If the seller was aware of the covenant but still entered into the contract, the decision to close would be a matter of contract interpretation and would depend on whether the covenant rendered the title unmarketable.

The mortgage was promptly recorded. Six months later, the bank assigned only the promissory note to an investor. The assignment made no express reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The bank immediately sent the buyer a notice of the assignment, which provided the address of the investor and explained that the bank was no longer servicing the loan. The buyer made timely payments to the investor for two years but then defaulted on the loan. After the buyer failed to cure the default, the investor accelerated the debt and commenced a foreclosure action. The buyer\u2019s defense in the foreclosure action is that the investor is not the mortgagee and therefore has no right to foreclose. Does the investor have the right to foreclose?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mortgage did not automatically accompany the assignment of the note to the investor.\nB. No, because the mortgage was extinguished when the bank assigned and transferred only the note to the investor.\nC. Yes, because the investor became the owner of both the note and the mortgage by virtue of the assignment of the note to him.\nD.

The assignment made no reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The investor immediately sent a notice to the buyer informing them of the assignment and providing contact information. The buyer made payments to the investor for two years before defaulting. The investor then commenced a foreclosure action against the buyer, who raised the defense that the investor is not the mortgagee.\n\n### Rule application\nA valid assignment of a mortgage must be in writing and must specify both the note and the mortgage being assigned. The mortgage is not automatically transferred along with the note, and its transfer requires a separate instrument. Failure to record an assignment of a mortgage does not affect its existence or the assignment of the underlying note.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the bank originally held both the note and the mortgage on the commercial building, the assignment of only the note to the investor was insufficient to transfer the mortgage. The investor did not become the owner of both the note and the mortgage by virtue of the assignment. The default by the buyer and the investor's subsequent foreclosure action are valid, and the buyer's defense that the investor is not the mortgagee is incorrect.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA landowner contracted to sell a tract of land to a painter by general warranty deed.

However, before the deed was recorded, the man died and was succeeded in his estate by his wife. The woman then stated her intention to take back the deed due to her unease with the wife's ownership.\n\n### Rule application\nEstoppel by deed is a doctrine that prevents a person from disclaiming a gift once it has been accepted by the donee. In this scenario, the woman's statement to the witnesses effectively constituted a disclaimer of the gift to the man. By doing so, she effectively revoked the deed to the man and created a valid gift to the niece.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the woman's statement to the witnesses effectively constituted a disclaimer of the gift to the man, estoppel by deed would likely prevent her from asserting any claim to the apartment building.

She then purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust and gave the remaining $80,000 to charity.\n\n### Rule application\nEmbezzlement is typically established by showing that the defendant converted property to their own use while holding a position of trust or authority over the property. In this scenario, the woman's actions involved a breach of trust by misappropriating trust funds for personal gain.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the woman invested the trust's funds in a speculative stock and later sold it for a significant profit, she may have committed embezzlement. However, the crime of embezzlement requires taking possession of the property with intent to convert it to one's own use. Since the woman did not retain ownership of the $80,000 after selling the stock, she did not commit embezzlement of that amount. The crime of embezzlement would therefore be limited to the $100,000 certificate of deposit and the value of the stock at the time of sale.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A state statute authorizes a state agency to issue revenue bonds to finance the construction of toll bridges. The statute requires the agency to charge tolls on the bridges to pay the principal, interest, and maintenance costs of the bonds. The statute also requires the agency, after all bonds are paid, to turn the bridges over to the state department of transportation for operation and maintenance as part of the state highway system. A federal statute authorizes the United States Department of Transportation to construct and operate toll bridges in the state. The federal statute provides that the department may construct a toll bridge anywhere in the state if it determines that a toll bridge is needed in that location. A department official announced that the department would construct a toll bridge in the same location as the state agency's planned toll bridge. The agency sued the department to restrain the department from constructing the bridge. The agency asserts that the department's planned bridge would be un",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled. Answer D is incorrect because the woman did embezzle $100,000; see the explanation for answer B.",

Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself.

Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed. The prosecutor offered evidence that the computer equipment was worth more than $1,000, but an expert witness called by the defense testified that the equipment was worth much less. The defense attorney has requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple theft.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

Upon arriving, they saw a man inside the home who was bleeding and shouting, but no one else was present. When the officers knocked on the door, the man refused to respond and told them not to come back unless they had a warrant. The officers then requested if the man needed medical assistance, and he told them to leave.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nSelf-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside. When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAssigned counsel for a capital defendant had heard that his client had an unsavory background and a highly dysfunctional childhood. He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Yes, because defense counsel is required to present any known mitigating factors in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The defendant's counsel did not investigate or present mitigating evidence despite having heard that the defendant had an unsavory background and a highly dysfunctional childhood.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder the United States Constitution, a defendant has the right to be represented by counsel in a capital case and the right to be sentenced only after a jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime. In the penalty phase of a capital case, the defendant has the right to have the sentencer consider as a mitigating factor any relevant information, including information in aggravation, that the defendant proffers. Ineffective assistance of counsel in a capital case occurs when counsel's performance was deficient and resulted in a substantial and injurious effect on the defendant's penalty.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that defense counsel failed to investigate or present mitigating evidence despite knowing the defendant's background and childhood, the court should grant the petition if it finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence would have affected the jury's sentence.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nA plaintiff sued a defendant for injuries suffered by the plaintiff when their automobiles collided.

            "question_number": 92,
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
