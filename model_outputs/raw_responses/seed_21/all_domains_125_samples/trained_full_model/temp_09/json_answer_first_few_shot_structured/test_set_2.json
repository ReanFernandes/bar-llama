Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB. No, because the law unduly burdens interstate commerce in oil and gas production.\nC. Yes, because property inheritance is a privilege created by state law.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

The next day, he returned to the factory floor and indiscriminately fired shotgun rounds into the air. The man later testified, without contradiction, that he had not intended to kill anyone but simply wanted to exact revenge on the factory's owners for having fired him. Unfortunately, one of the bullets ricocheted off the wall and killed the factory's security officer. The most serious degree of criminal homicide under state law is first-degree murder. First-degree murder is defined as the intentional premeditated killing of another. Second-degree murder is defined as the killing of another during the commission of a common-law felony. Manslaughter is defined as the at common law felony of assault with a deadly weapon. The man was charged with first-degree murder of the security officer. A psychiatrist, who had examined the man, testified that in her opinion the man was mentally ill at the time of the killing and that his mental illness had substantially impaired his ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to exercise self-control.

            "question_number": 6,
            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law.

The State B insurance companies bring suit against the insurance company in federal district court. The insurance company has moved to dismiss the complaint, contending that the U.S. Constitution does not provide a cause of action to the State B insurance companies. Should the court grant the insurance company's motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the insurance company has a substantial interest in having uniform rates for its burglary insurance policies.\nB. Yes, because the insurance company is a private entity.\nC. No, because the insurance company is charged with the responsibility of enforcing the state statute.\nD. No, because the state statute is a legitimate means of protecting the reputation of State B businesses",

Answer A is incorrect. \u201cCapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d applies only in situations where litigation is unlikely to be completed because of the short-term nature of an issue, such as review of an explicitly short-term legal mandate. Answer B is incorrect. The voluntary cessation exception does not apply when it is unreasonable to expect that the allegedly unlawful conduct will recur. The emergency ordinance\u2019s explicit requirements of prior notice and owner consent make it unreasonable to expect that the city will attempt to change the homeowner\u2019s meter without prior notice and the homeowner\u2019s consent.

The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders Inc. for a construction price of $18000.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct because on its face the ordinance discriminates against commerce from outside the city. By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory. Such facially discriminatory laws are allowed only in the absence of any nondiscriminatory way to promote the government\u2019s interest. C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994). Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest. Answer C is incorrect. Because the law is facially discriminatory, it is not subject to the \u201cundue burden\u201d test. In addition, we do not have sufficient facts to know whether the ordinance would pass this test. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land. Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here. Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue. Answer D is incorrect. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the taking serves a public purpose.",

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations is not the proper standard. Because the government is demanding public access to the property in exchange for a permit to build, the test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Answer D is incorrect. Whether or not the condition substantially advances a legitimate interest of the city is not the proper standard.

So long as it complies with this requirement, a company is free to charge whatever rate the market will bear for its burglary insurance policies. An insurance company located in the state files suit in federal district court against appropriate state officials to challenge this state statute on constitutional grounds. The insurance company wishes to charge customers residing within the same county in the state rates for burglary insurance policies that will vary because they would be based on the specific nature of the customer's business, on its precise location, and on its past claims. In this suit, the court should \nAnswer Choices:\nA. hold the statute unconstitutional, because the statute deprives the insurance company of its liberty or property without due process of law.\nB. hold the statute unconstitutional, because the statute imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. hold the statute constitutional, because the statute is a reasonable exercise of the state's police power.\nD. abstain from ruling on the merits of this case until the state courts have had an opportunity to pass on the constitutionality of this state statute.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. In Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the exigency. Here, the police lawfully knocked and announced their presence at the door. That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the police conduct\u2014knocking and announcing their presence\u2014was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. A Miranda warning is required whenever a suspect is (1) in custody and (2) being subjected to custodial interrogation. Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct because, under the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, an appellate court may remedy an error that was plain or obvious if that error affected substantial rights. Here, the error was obvious, of constitutional dimension, and likely prejudicial. Consequently, the court of appeals has authority to reverse the conviction. Answer A is incorrect because, although a defendant\u2019s failure to object can change the standard of appellate review, it does not foreclose review. Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on direct appeal. For such errors, the defendant is not required to claim or prove ineffective assistance of counsel. Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, \u201cpenalized\u201d by an attorney\u2019s failure to object. Because the attorney did not object, the defendant must now meet the stringent requirements of the plain-error standard. Had the error been preserved by a contemporaneous objection, the standard of review would be more favorable to the defendant.",

The lease does not explicitly say that the owner may enter the house to show it to prospective lessees, but such a right may be fairly implied in order to carry out the intention of the parties. Answer A is incorrect. The principle of reasonable expectations posits that parties should not be bound by terms that they would not expect to find in a contract unless those terms were called to their attention. That doctrine is not relevant here. Answer C is incorrect. Best efforts is a duty read into a contract to prevent it from being illusory when the scope of a party\u2019s performance is omitted or unclear. The duty of best efforts, which requires all parties to use their best efforts to carry out the intent of the contract, is not relevant here. Answer D is incorrect. The objective theory means that a party to a contract is bound by a contract term even if that party is not subjectively aware of the term; it is not relevant here.",

An intended beneficiary can enforce a contract to which it is not a party, because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302. However, one party to the contract can assert, against the beneficiary, claims for breach by the other party to the contract. Here, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to perform the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for breach of that promise against the bank. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 309(2). Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to do the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for damages against the bank, as an intended beneficiary. Answer C is incorrect. The bank is not an incidental beneficiary. Instead the bank is an intended beneficiary that can enforce a contract to which it is not a party because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary.

And even if the carpenter\u2019s breach was material, the bank could recover the value of the work done for the homeowner as restitution. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374.",

By his duly probated will, the landowner devised Lot 1 \"to my daughter for life, remainder to my son.\" The landowner was survived by his son and two daughters. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is a statutory exception to the Rule Against Perpetuities in the state where the landowner died. The landowner's daughter, the life tenant of Lot 1, entered into a written contract to sell Lot 1 to a purchaser for $100,000.

A party that materially breaches a contract is nevertheless entitled to recover under a theory of restitution the amount of the value of the benefit that the breaching party\u2019s part performance conferred on the victim of the breach. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374. Answer A is incorrect. A breaching party cannot recover on a theory of reliance. Answer B is incorrect. This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation.

Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale. Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the goods for resale rather than seeking costs and lost profit.

The prosecutor wishes to introduce into evidence a ledger found at the defendant\u2019s home during the execution of a search warrant. The ledger includes detailed information regarding the defendant\u2019s purchases and sales of drugs over a two-year period. The prosecutor is considering two alternative ways to lay the foundation for admission of the ledger as a business record. The first alternative is to call the police officer who executed the search warrant to testify that she found the ledger in the defendant\u2019s home. The second alternative is to call a codefendant, who has pled guilty, to testify that he was the defendant\u2019s drug supplier for over two years and that he was present when the defendant used the ledger to record their transactions as well as transactions with other buyers and sellers as they occurred. Which of the following is correct regarding the ledger\u2019s admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ledger may be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant.\nB. The ledger may be admitted through the codefendant but not through the officer.\nC. The ledger may not be admitted through either the officer or the codefendant, because business records may be introduced only through testimony by a records custodian.\nD.

She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. Should the defendant's motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the woman entered the defendant's computer without permission.\nB. No, because the woman did not intend to violate the defendant's privacy.\nC. Yes, because the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his computer files.",

One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to the suspect's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to the suspect's house. The police knocked on the suspect's door and called out, \"Police. Open up. We have a search warrant.\" After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found the suspect with a large brown suitcase and put handcuffs on the suspect. A search of his person revealed a switchblade knife and a .45-caliber pistol. The suspect cursed the police and said, \"You never would have caught me with the stuff if it hadn't been for that lousy snitch Harvey!\" The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every room and closet.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation. Answer D is incorrect. The trial judge has the discretion to alter the order of proof without a showing of specific prejudice by an opposing party.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Because the fire marshal is a public official and his conclusion about the cause of the fire is a factual finding based upon an official investigation, the report is admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. The witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception, however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement must be excised from the report. Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under      a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation protects defendants only in criminal cases and so does not protect the neighbor in this civil action. Answer D is incorrect. Public officials may rely on bystander statements and hearsay in making factual findings. To the extent that a public official\u2019s factual findings rest on only such hearsay, those findings could be excluded for a lack of trustworthiness under FRE 803(8)(B). Here, the fire marshal\u2019s factual findings rest on his significant experience, as well as his examination of the scene, and would not be excludable solely due to reliance on some hearsay.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The routine practice of the company\u2019s agents in discussing supplemental policy options with customers is admissible under FRE 406. Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury.

In a severable provision, the Commission's enabling statute also provides that the Congress, by simple majorities in each house, may veto the issuance of a particular license by the Commission if such a veto occurs within 30 days following the required Commission finding. Early last year, the Commission found that a particular energy company, met all statutory requirements and, therefore, voted to issue the energy company a license authorizing it to construct a nuclear energy plant. Because they believed that the issuance of a license to the energy company was not in accord with the applicable statutory criteria, a majority of each of the two houses of Congress voted, within the specified 30-day period, to veto the license.

Extrinsic evidence of the girlfriend\u2019s earlier statement may be admitted for the purpose of impeaching her direct testimony that the defendant was at home with her during the entire morning, since she was given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. The statement is admissible for impeachment purposes only, though, because it would be hearsay not within any exception if offered to prove the truth of the statement concerning the time the defendant left home. Answer A is incorrect. FRE 613(b) permits proof of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence so long as the witness has an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Here, the girlfriend had that opportunity and denied the statement, making proof of the statement by extrinsic evidence permissible. Answer B is incorrect.

Rule 13(g) specifically provides that a crossclaim may include a claim that the co-party is or \u201cmay be\u201d liable for all or part of the claim asserted in the main action. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure often allow for the assertion of contingent claims to avoid multiple lawsuits and encourage resolution of the entire controversy among the parties with a minimum of procedural steps.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a judgment on the pleadings may be made after the pleadings are closed. However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

As the state-law claim remains to be decided in the action, there is not yet a final judgment on the merits of the entire action, and thus an appeal is not allowed under the final judgment rule. Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim.

Ten years ago, the landowner executed and delivered to a power company a right-of-way deed that lawfully authorized the power company to erect and maintain an overhead power line across a portion of the landowner's land. The deed was properly recorded. The landowner then planted a stand of trees on the land, obstructing the view of the power line from the landowner's house. Six years ago, the landowner lawfully sold the land to a purchaser. At the closing, the landowner provided the purchaser with an abstract of title that failed to reflect the existence of the right-of-way deed. The purchaser paid the full purchase price and received an abstract from the lawyer that failed to reveal the existence of the right-of-way deed. The power company then served notice on the landowner and the purchaser that it intended to cut down the trees that obscured the view of the power line. The notice stated that the cutting down of the trees was authorized by the right-of-way deed. The landowner and the purchaser then sought an injunction from the court forbidding the cutting down of the trees. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landowner, because the right-of-way deed authorized the cutting down of the trees.\nB. The landowner, because he paid the full purchase price.\nC.

At that time, the woman did not own the land because she had lost it in the foreclosure action. At the time of the woman\u2019s death, she only had an interest in the surplus proceeds, which was personal property that passed to the brother, who is the woman\u2019s residuary legatee. Answer A is incorrect. Whether the brother or the charity prevails depends on whether the woman owned the land when she died. How the woman lost ownership of the land is irrelevant.      Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s intent is irrelevant. When a will specifically disposes of land not owned by the testator at death, the bequest to the specific legatee adeems (fails).

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. A buyer is on constructive notice of all information that a search of the land records would reveal. At issue is whether the entrepreneur had record (constructive) notice of the restriction. If so, the entrepreneur would not be a good-faith purchaser for value.

Here, the deed from the man to the woman is outside of the entrepreneur\u2019s chain of title even though they share a common grantor. Thus, knowing whether the jurisdiction\u2019s law puts a buyer on notice of all land transfers of the buyer\u2019s grantor, even those outside of the chain of title, is essential.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC.

The plat of the subdivision was recorded as authorized by statute. Twelve years ago, the landowner erected an industrial building wholly situated on Lot 1 but with one wall along the boundary line with Lot 2, thereby encroaching upon Lot 2 by eight inches. Lot 2 remained vacant until six months ago, when the landowner erected an industrial building wholly situated on Lot 2 but with one wall along the boundary line with Lot 1, thereby encroaching upon Lot 1 by eight inches. The landowner knew that the erection of the building on Lot 2 would encroach upon Lot 1, but nevertheless the landowner did erect the building on Lot 2. The jurisdiction has no statute specifically dealing with encroachments. The landowner and the landowner's attorney know that, in the jurisdiction, title to real property is determined by reference to the records of the county, and they therefore advise the landowner to bring an appropriate action against the landowner's neighbor to quiet title to Lot 1. The landowner's neighbor is the owner of Lot 2. In such lawsuit, who will probably prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landowner, because he has an easement by necessity.\n",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. Acceleration clauses are valid. While typically triggered by nonpayment of the mortgage debt, they can also be triggered by the mortgagor\u2019s failure to satisfy other conditions in the mortgage, such as timely payment of insurance premiums. Answer A is incorrect. Once acceleration has properly occurred, the consequences cannot be avoided because the owner attempts to pay the delinquent insurance premium. Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect. The desire to bring a foreclosure action does not create a right to accelerate a mortgage. Rather, the right to accelerate depends upon whether a term of a mortgage has been breached.

The seller accepted the daughter\u2019s offer, conveyed the building to the daughter, and paid the broker a commission. After discovering that the purchaser was the broker\u2019s daughter, the seller commenced an action against the broker for return of the commission. Who is likely to prevail in this action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The broker, because the daughter, not the broker, purchased the building in an arm\u2019s- length transaction.\nB. The broker, because the seller was obligated to sell to anyone at the full listing price.\nC. The seller, because the broker\u2019s failure to make full disclosure breached a fiduciary duty to the seller.\nD.

One evening, armed with a pistol, he crouched behind some bushes on a park hillside overlooking a path where he knew his daughter often jogged. On this occasion, however, she did not jog; instead, she lay on a blanket with her boyfriend. The father fired five shots at the couple, missing them both. A nearby tree limb caught fire, and after a few seconds burned so intensely that it fell onto the couple, injuring the boyfriend. The jurisdiction defines aggravated assault as \"an attempt to commit a serious offense.\" The boyfriend was taken to the hospital by ambulance. On the way to the hospital, the ambulance driver suffered a heart attack and had to be taken to the hospital by the paramedics who had been riding in the back of the ambulance. The paramedics left the ambulance and the driver in the road, and rushed the boyfriend to the hospital. The driver later died from the heart attack. The paramedics were charged with manslaughter of the ambulance driver. If they are convicted, what should their sentence be?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Death.\nB. Life in prison.\nC.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other. Which party is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because a default will be implied by the court under these facts.\nB.

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by deed\u201d or \u201cafter-acquired property.\u201d Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple to the purchaser (the son\u2019s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired it from the son.      Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death.

The rupture resulted from a defect in the tire that existed at the time it was sold by the manufacturer to a retailer, who sold it to the driver and installed it on her car. The driver sued the manufacturer on a strict products liability theory. During discovery, the driver\u2019s attorney obtained a memorandum that had circulated among engineers employed by the manufacturer. The memorandum acknowledged that undetectable defects would cause ruptures in approximately one out of every 10,000 tires sold. The manufacturer sells approximately 10 million tires per year. After discovering this memorandum, the driver\u2019s attorney filed a timely amended complaint, adding a claim for battery. The manufacturer has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the battery claim, based on the undisputed facts set out above. If no additional facts are provided to the court concerning the risk of tire rupture, should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care to prevent ruptures.\nB. No, because the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that consumers would be injured by tire ruptures.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The driver might have a valid strict products liability claim against the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support a finding\u2014required for battery liability\u2014that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect. There is no rule of tort law stating that a plaintiff is prohibited from pursuing claims for battery and products liability on the basis of the same set of facts.",

The distributor knew that an improper ratio of sand, water, and cement would result in defective concrete, but the distributor played no role in determining the ratio used by the construction company in mixing the concrete. The construction company used the concrete to form supporting columns for a building. A year later, the building collapsed during a minor earthquake, causing injury to the occupants.

A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a finished product by the product\u2019s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the component is what rendered the finished product defective.

In this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability.

The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified in the explanation for answer B are met).

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver. Even under the \u201cextended personality\u201d doctrine\u2014which, for example, allows a battery plaintiff to establish the necessary contact element if the defendant touches an article of clothing the plaintiff is wearing\u2014making contact with the bus is almost certain not to count as contacting the driver\u2019s person. Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect.

Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the employment relationship to be \u201cspecial\u201d in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher\u2019s claim will fail because it does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional distress, without physical injury. Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty. As noted earlier, courts generally do not recognize a duty to take care against causing emotional distress unconnected to a physical injury. Answer D is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher\u2019s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the existence of a duty.",

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. A rule of products liability law states that there is no recovery if a defect in a product causes damage only to the product itself (as opposed to personal injury, or injury to other property). This rule is sometimes referred to as the \u201ceconomic loss rule.\u201d In such cases, the owner of the damaged product is limited to contract remedies. Answer B is incorrect. The absence of negligence on the part of the manufacturer does not provide a basis for denying recovery to the couple on a strict products liability claim. Answer C is incorrect. Recovery on a strict products liability claim does not depend on whether the evidence supports an inference of manufacturer negligence. Answer D is incorrect for the reasons stated in the explanation for answer A.",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n{\n        \"domain\": \"Criminal_law\",\n        \"chosen_option_label\": \"B\",\n        \"explanation\": {\n            \"Legal_concept\": \"Self-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\",\n            \"Fact_analysis\": \"The husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside.

Under the sponsorship agreement, the dealership was required to arrange for licensed and trained emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to be present during the race. The dealership contracted with a licensed and reputable emergency medical services (EMS) firm that supplied EMTs for events such as these. A motorcyclist participating in the race was injured when he lost control of his motorcycle. The motorcyclist was treated at the scene by the EMTs. In removing the motorcyclist\u2019s helmet, one of the EMTs twisted the motorcyclist\u2019s neck, causing him to become permanently paralyzed. The motorcyclist has sued both the EMS firm and the dealership, alleging that the EMT\u2019s careless conduct caused his paralysis. Assuming the validity of the motorcyclist\u2019s negligence claim against the EMS firm, which of the following best characterizes the dealership\u2019s potential liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The dealership is directly liable for hiring the EMS firm.\nB. The dealership is vicariously liable, because it owed a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care for the race.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. Because the dealership\u2019s duty of care was delegable, because the dealership was not negligent in hiring the EMS firm, and because the EMT was not an employee of the dealership, there is no basis for holding the dealership liable, whether directly or vicariously. Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is also no basis for direct liability. Answer B is incorrect. The duty to provide competent medical care was properly delegated to the EMS firm. Answer C is incorrect. Because the EMT was an employee only of the EMS firm, not the dealership, any carelessness by the EMT could be imputed only to the EMS firm.",
