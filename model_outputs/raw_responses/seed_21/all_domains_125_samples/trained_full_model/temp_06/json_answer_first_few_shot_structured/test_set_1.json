            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction.

Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Although a request for waiver of service was sent, the defendant was not obligated to and did not respond to the request. Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense.

However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery. However, the woman\u2019s goal is to dismiss and refile the action. Submitting the described affidavit would not achieve that goal.",

The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims, this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited.",

Lot 2 remained vacant until six months ago, when the landowner erected a house. The landowner had obtained all governmental approvals required to build the house. The new house was completed on Lot 2 and occupied by the landowner. The landowner then conveyed Lot 1 to a friend and moved into the house on Lot 2. The plat of the subdivision showed a 10-foot wide utility easement running from the back of Lot 1, across the park, to the back of Lot 2. This easement was intended for the installation of utilities, such as water and sewer lines. The plat was recorded as authorized by statute. The landowner had not obtained approval of the plat from the public utility commission, as required by statute. Shortly after the landowner moved into his new house, the public utility commission, as authorized by statute, required the landowner to remove the house on Lot 2 because the installation of utilities was impaired by the presence of the house.

At trial, he testified that he only sold the cocaine to the agent, whom the defendant believed was a representative of a large cocaine distribution organization, because he had been paid $2,000 to do so by the organization's boss. The defendant then introduced records, which he had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, showing that the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, which later became the DEA, had paid the defendant's boss $10,000 six months earlier to help the bureau in its investigation of the cocaine distribution organization. The records also showed that the bureau had, in the past, paid other confidential informants to assist it in cocaine investigations. The prosecutor argued that the records were privileged and should be excluded from evidence. Should the records be admitted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), holds that Congress does not have the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate a noncommercial activity with no link to interstate commerce. Unlike in Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), the facts here do not involve a comprehensive regulation of commerce that incidentally covers some intrastate activities. Answer A is incorrect. Congress can use its commerce power to regulate economic activity, such as manufacturing and production of articles for interstate commerce, that is not itself a commercial transaction. In addition, Gonzales v. Raich holds that Congress can incidentally regulate noncommercial activities in order to effectuate regulations of related commercial activities. Answer C is incorrect. While stoves and fuels may have previously moved in interstate commerce, they are not themselves channels or instrumentalities of commerce. Answer D is incorrect. United States v. Lopez holds that the aggregate effects test applies only to regulations of economic activity.",

The statute authorizes the President to appoint the agency\u2019s director with the advice and consent of the Senate and prohibits the President from removing the director without the Senate\u2019s consent. The President appointed a director, and the Senate confirmed the appointment. Recently, the President has become dissatisfied with the director\u2019s strict approach to drug-law enforcement and wishes to remove the director. Because a majority of senators favor strict drug-law enforcement, the Senate has refused to consent to the director\u2019s removal. May the President constitutionally remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director\u2019s appointment and removal.\nB. No, because the President\u2019s removal of principal officers of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\nC.

In a written agreement, the government agreed to pay the contractor an annual fixed fee and to reimburse the contractor for all expenses associated with the work. The agreement provided that the contractor must pay for all materials and expenses from a special bank account into which the government would deposit required payments and reimbursements. The state collected a generally applicable sales tax from the contractor on materials purchased for the work with money from the special bank account.

No, because the tax was paid from an account directly funded with federal money and the entire economic cost of the tax was borne by the federal government.\nC.

By a properly executed and recorded deed, the landowner conveyed to a friend the following: \"To my friend and to his heirs as long as it is used exclusively for residential purposes. But if it is ever used for other than residential purposes, to the American Red Cross.\" About ten years later, the landowner died and by will, duly admitted to probate, devised his entire estate to his brother. The landowner was survived by his brother and by his daughter, the landowner's sole heir. The landowner's will did not contain any provision dealing with Blackacre. The brother and the daughter are now in a jurisdiction which recognizes the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities unmodified by statute. The brother and the daughter have been unable to agree as to the status of Blackacre. The brother contends that Blackacre is free and unencumbered because the restriction to residential use was a gift causa mortis to the American Red Cross. The daughter contends that Blackacre is encumbered by the restriction to residential use and that she cannot sell or mortgage Blackacre without violating the terms of the deed. The sister and the brother have now brought an appropriate action to determine the status of Blackacre. In such lawsuit, who should prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Based on a finding that private entities were more efficient operators of such facilities than public entities, the city sold the reservoir to a privately owned company. The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city.

The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A. Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory. A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient to demonstrate race discrimination. Answer D is incorrect. It states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not applicable in this case. The state sterilization requirement would receive strict judicial scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation.",

On numerous occasions, the wife\u2019s brother had offered to buy the farm from her, but she had always refused. The husband died suddenly in an accident. The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children. What would be the wife\u2019s strongest argument for rescinding the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Duress.\nB. Mistake.\nC. Unconscionability.\nD. Undue influence.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

He or she entered into a written contract with a purchaser under which the landowner agreed to sell the land to the purchaser in fee simple by installments on the last day of each month for the next ten months. The contract provided that the landowner would deliver to the purchaser, by the last day of each month, an abstract of title for the landowner's attorney to examine and that the purchaser would pay the price for the land as it was delivered. The contract was silent as to who was to pay the expenses of the examination of the abstract. On the first monthly payment due, the purchaser paid the price in full and the landowner delivered to the purchaser an abstract of title. The landowner did not deliver the deed because the purchaser had not paid the expenses of the examination of the abstract. The landowner had not been able to obtain a marketable title because there was outstanding a valid easement for a highway across a portion of the landowner's land.

When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property violated the double jeopardy clause.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

Here, however, there was no modification of the contract, because the daughter did not agree to it. Answer C is incorrect. The father retained no interest in the future proceeds of his daughter\u2019s promise, and thus he could not alter her obligation without her consent. Answer D is incorrect. There was no effective modification, because the daughter did not agree to it.

The company\u2019s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions between individuals. Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the homeowner, it could argue that the cousin\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner\u2019s loss. But a stronger defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner. Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions just because there is a speech component to the defendant\u2019s actions. Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company\u2019s strongest defense. The question of whether a defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.",

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts.

The tree specialist\u2019s action meets the definition of conversion regardless of the fact that he was directed to take that action by the landowner. Answer D is incorrect. Because the tree specialist was hired by the landowner and cut down the trees at the direction of the landowner, the landowner (along with the tree specialist) is subject to liability for conversion.",

After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health.

In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Answer B is incorrect. The passenger\u2019s negligence is relevant to the damages awarded, if any, but it is not a bar to a res ipsa instruction. Answer D is incorrect. The question of the passenger\u2019s negligence is not relevant to whether a res ipsa instruction is appropriate but rather to the amount of damages to assess if the company is found liable.",

He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was arrested and charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property.

On the day he arrived, just after sunset, he took his bag upstairs to a second-floor bedroom and unpacked. As he was about to head back downstairs, he realized that the stairwell had become too dark to navigate without a light.

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure.

It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be. Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff\u2019s injury and supports the claim that the paint can dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.   Answer B is incorrect.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying. Here, the defendant\u2019s purpose for his wrongful conduct (killing the declarant) was revenge for a theft and not a desire to prevent trial testimony.

When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Should the man's conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because he was convicted of larceny and that was the basis for the malicious damage of property conviction.\nB. Yes, because the malicious damage of property conviction would violate double jeopardy if it were based on a conviction for larceny of the car.\nC. No, because the malicious damage of property conviction is not based on the larceny conviction.\nD. No, because the larceny and the mal",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The defense attorney should have immediately objected when the witness related inadmissible hearsay. An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103. In addition, the delayed objection failed to preserve the right to appeal, because the defense attorney did not state a specific basis for the objection under FRE 103. Answer A is incorrect. Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103. Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect. An objection must be made at the earliest opportunity under FRE 103, and an objection that is made \u201cduring trial\u201d but not while the witness is still on the stand is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.",

The defense may offer extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for the limited non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness after the witness has been given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Answer A is incorrect. The witness\u2019s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose. And since there is no applicable hearsay exception for the witness\u2019s statement to the investigator, it cannot be admitted to prove that the plaintiff did not fall.",

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness.

The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

The defendant objects to admission of the newspaper story. Is the newspaper story admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the plaintiff has not offered proper authentication of the story.\nB. No, because the story constitutes hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, because the story satisfies the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.\nD.

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect. Because the newspaper story is not offered for its truth, but rather to demonstrate notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy, it is not hearsay, and no hearsay exception is required for its admission.

At issue is the identification of the person who made a telephone call to the victim. The victim was in his office when he received the call. A voice on the other end of the call said, \"Give me $10,000 or I'll kill your family.\" The victim recognized the voice as that of his brother-in-law.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

The mortgage was promptly recorded. Six months later, the bank assigned only the promissory note to an investor. The assignment made no express reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The bank immediately sent the buyer a notice of the assignment, which provided the address of the investor and explained that the bank was no longer servicing the loan. The buyer made timely payments to the investor for two years but then defaulted on the loan. After the buyer failed to cure the default, the investor accelerated the debt and commenced a foreclosure action. The buyer\u2019s defense in the foreclosure action is that the investor is not the mortgagee and therefore has no right to foreclose. Does the investor have the right to foreclose?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mortgage did not automatically accompany the assignment of the note to the investor.\nB. No, because the mortgage was extinguished when the bank assigned and transferred only the note to the investor.\nC.

The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders Inc. for a construction price of $18000.

In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled.

Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed.

The deed was released by the landowner's heir, who was also the personal representative of the landowner's estate. There was then a change in state law, and the power company decided to construct the power line underground. It abandoned the overhead power line and the right-of-way. The landowner's heir then executed and delivered to a contractor a written right-of-way deed, which was properly recorded, authorizing the contractor to excavate a portion of Greenacre for the installation of an underground power line. The contractor began the excavation, but before completing the installation of the underground line, it abandoned the project and left Greenacre in a messy condition.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
