The landowner entered into a written contract with a builder to build a house of stated specifications on Richacre and to sell the house and lot to the builder. The contract provided for an \"inside date\" of April 1 2007 and an \"outside date\" of May 1 2007 for completion of the house and delivery of a deed. Neither party tendered performance on the dates stated. On May 3 2007 the builder notified the landowner in writing of the builder's election to cancel the contract because of the landowner's failure to deliver title by May 1 . On May 12 the landowner notified the builder that some unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that the landowner was entitled to a reasonable time to complete. The notification also included a promise that the landowner would be ready to perform by May 29 and that he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as a company\u2019s headquarters. Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to personal jurisdiction in this action. Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here. Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business, with some treating a company\u2019s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a company\u2019s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.",

The County Tax Commission, in making its assessments, has uniformly and consistently determined the \"actual value\" of real property solely by reference to the price at which the particular property was last sold. In recent years, the market values of real property in the county have been rising at the rate of 15% per year. A homeowner is required to pay real estate taxes in the county that are 200% to 300% higher than those paid by many other owners of similar properties in similar neighborhoods in that county, even though the current market values of the respective properties of the homeowner and those of the other owners are nearly identical. The homeowner has filed suit against the County Tax Commission, charging that the tax assessments of the Commission are unconstitutional and are violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim. Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim. Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.",

Twenty-five days after service of the amended complaint, the second defendant removed the action to federal court in State B.\n\n### Rule application\nFor a court to have diversity jurisdiction over a case, the court must have authority over the case at bar because the original lawsuit was filed in state court and the amended complaint added a federal-law claim.

Here, the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction.

Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the forum state was not a bar to removal. Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Although a request for waiver of service was sent, the defendant was not obligated to and did not respond to the request. Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be inappropriate. Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service. Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it   does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default. Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.",

Other passengers have also brought individual actions in State B federal court. The railroad has moved the court to transfer the action to the State B federal district court.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder the federal venue statute, a court may transfer a civil action to a different district if the action could have been brought in the transferee district and the transfer is in the interests of justice. Transfer is appropriate when a court can handle the case more efficiently, avoid travel costs and delay, and/or eliminate the burden on parties and witnesses.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the accident occurred in State B and many witnesses are located there, as well as the potential for efficiency and cost savings by consolidating related actions in one court, the railroad's best argument in support of the motion to transfer is that transfer to the State B federal court is in the interests of justice.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A landowner owned a vacant lot known as Richacre.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most convenient venue for the action. Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad\u2019s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum selected by the passenger. Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question, such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.",

When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man's conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because he was committing a felony.\nC.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the consumer\u2019s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error. Answer A is incorrect. The attorney\u2019s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is   not an obstacle to the judge\u2019s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim. Answer B is incorrect.

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense. Assuming that the store has raised an assumption- of-risk defense and that both sides have filed summary judgment motions based on the facts set out above, how should the trial court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The court should enter judgment as a matter of law for the friend.\nB. The court should deny both motions.\nC. The court should rule that the friend\u2019s action fails as a matter of law because he implicitly assumed the risk of the manager\u2019s carelessness.\nD.

Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal, without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by giving notice. Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have appeared in the action.

The manufacturer timely demanded a jury trial, and the court informed the parties that it would seat a seven-person jury. The parties agreed to a non-unanimous jury verdict. The jury returned a verdict for the homeowner. The manufacturer asked the court to poll the jury, and the poll revealed a 4 to 3 vote in favor of the homeowner. The manufacturer objected to the verdict and has moved for a new trial. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny a new trial, because the manufacturer agreed to a non-unanimous verdict.\nB. Direct the jury to deliberate further until it can return a verdict supported by at least six jurors.\nC.

The manufacturer and the homeowner agreed to a non-unanimous verdict. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the homeowner, but a poll revealed a 4 to 3 vote in favor of the homeowner. The manufacturer objected to the verdict and moved for a new trial.\n\n### Rule application\nFederal Rule 49(b)(3) allows a court to grant a new trial if the jury has rendered a verdict that is not supported by a majority of the jury. This provision provides a basis for granting a new trial in cases where a jury has returned a verdict that is not unanimous, but does not address issues of jury misconduct or mistake.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the jury returned a verdict in favor of the homeowner, but a poll revealed a minority vote, the court should grant a new trial based on the grounds of jury misconduct or mistake.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor\u2019s claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker\u2019s answer or it will be forfeited. Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or state law. Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to the investor\u2019s securities law claim. Answer D is incorrect.

A state judge subsequently issued a writ of habeas corpus against the facility's director, challenging the governor's detention under federal law.\n\n### Rule application\nHabeas corpus is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution, and it extends to individuals in both state and federal custody. The writ aims to ensure that detentions are lawful and that individuals are not held indefinitely without a hearing.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the governor was arrested pursuant to a valid warrant and is currently in federal custody, the writ of habeas corpus issued by the state judge may be valid.

A US company is suing the appropriate federal agency to enjoin enforcement of the second statute. The government has moved to dismiss the action on the ground of a nonjusticiable political question.\n\n### Rule application\nThe political question doctrine typically applies to cases involving sensitive issues of foreign affairs that implicate the executive branch's plenary authority in foreign relations. These cases typically involve disputes over the validity of executive agreements or actions taken pursuant to executive agreements. By contrast, the case at hand involves a statutory ban on trade with a foreign country based on a prior executive decision to withhold diplomatic recognition. The court should not dismiss the action as a political question because the legal standard for enforcing this statute is clear: the court should enjoin enforcement if it finds the statute to be unconstitutional.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the legal standard for enforcing this statute is clear and that the case involves a dispute over the constitutionality of a federal statute, the court should not dismiss the action as a political question.

The substance can be consumed in the form of tea, causing awareness but also paralysis and death. There is no commercial market for the substance, and it is not part of a broader federal statutory scheme.\n\n### Rule application\nThe regulation of interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause allows Congress to enact legislation that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The possession of the tea would not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce if it were not for the fact that the tea contains a stimulant extracted from a weed found in vacant lots. This means that the regulation of the possession of the tea is valid under the Commerce Clause.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the regulation of the possession of the tea is not part of a broader federal statutory scheme and does have a substantial effect on interstate commerce due to the presence of a stimulant extracted from a weed found in vacant lots, it is valid under the Commerce Clause.

While stoves and fuels may have previously moved in interstate commerce, they are not themselves channels or instrumentalities of commerce. Answer D is incorrect. United States v.

The statute authorizes the President to appoint the agency\u2019s director with the advice and consent of the Senate and prohibits the President from removing the director without the Senate\u2019s consent. The President appointed a director, and the Senate confirmed the appointment. Recently, the President has become dissatisfied with the director\u2019s strict approach to drug-law enforcement and wishes to remove the director. Because a majority of senators favor strict drug-law enforcement, the Senate has refused to consent to the director\u2019s removal. May the President constitutionally remove the director without the Senate\u2019s consent?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director\u2019s appointment and removal.\nB. No, because the President\u2019s removal of principal officers of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nThe constitutional separation of powers, specifically the executive branch's authority to remove executive branch appointees.\n\n### Fact analysis\nCongress created a federal agency to enforce drug laws and appointed a director to lead it. The director's removal is prohibited by the President without the Senate's consent. The President has become dissatisfied with the director's strict approach to drug enforcement and wishes to replace them.\n\n### Rule application\nThe President's removal of a principal officer of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution grants the President the power to remove executive branch appointees, but this power is subject to certain conditions set forth in the Constitution. Article I, Section 2 gives Congress the power to advise and consent on executive appointments. The Constitution also provides that the Senate may determine the qualifications of its own members. These provisions of the Constitution suggest that congressional participation in the removal of a presidential appointee would not violate the separation of powers.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the President's removal of a principal officer of the United States is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, the President cannot constitutionally remove the director without the Senate's consent. The constitutional separation of powers supports this conclusion. Congress created the director position and may properly impose conditions for the director's appointment and removal, but these conditions must be consistent with the constitutional separation of powers.\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man decided to steal a car he saw parked on a hill.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nThe constitutionality of state regulations affecting interstate commerce, specifically the application of registration and permit requirements to wholly interstate carriers.\n\n### Fact analysis\nA state law requires motor carriers hauling goods on state highways to register with and obtain a permit from the state's transportation commission. The purpose of this requirement is to facilitate the application of state laws to carriers using state highways. The fee for registration is nominal, and the commission has no discretion to deny a permit to a carrier that properly registers and pays the registration fee. The question is whether these requirements apply to wholly interstate carriers.\n\n### Rule application\nThe registration and permit requirements must be applied to wholly interstate carriers if they are the only prerequisites to issuance of a permit. The requirements do not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce since carriers must register and pay a fee to operate in most states. The requirements are also applied equally to intrastate and interstate carriers, further justifying their application to wholly interstate carriers.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the registration and permit requirements are the only prerequisites to issuance of a permit and are applied equally to intrastate and interstate carriers, they must be applied to wholly interstate carriers. Therefore, the requirements are constitutional when applied to wholly interstate carriers, supporting option C.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A state statute requires each insurance company that offers burglary insurance policies in the state to charge a uniform rate for such insurance to all of its customers residing within the same county in that state. So long as it complies with this requirement, a company is free to charge whatever rate the market will bear for its burglary insurance policies. If an insurance company located in the state offers burglary insurance policies to customers residing in the state but charges customers residing in different counties in the state different rates for such insurance, the company is in violation of this statute. A recently established insurance company located in the state offers burglary insurance policies to customers residing in various counties in the state. The company charges customers residing in different counties in the state different rates for such insurance. The higher the customer's risk, the higher the rate the company charges the customer for burglary insurance.

The city council granted the company a non-exclusive franchise to supply water to residents of the city. After it had operated the water system for a year, the company determined that a city resident had fallen three months behind in the payment of his water bill. The company terminated the resident\u2019s water service on the basis of a company policy that provides for the summary termination of service to customers who fall more than two months behind in the payment of their bills. The policy does not provide customers an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of service. The resident sued the company in an appropriate court, asking for injunctive relief and damages. The resident claimed only that he had been deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

However, this regulation may burden interstate commerce by making it difficult for out-of-state tutoring companies to operate in the state.\n\n### Rule application\nA state law that burdens interstate commerce must have a legitimate state interest and be substantially related to an important state interest.

            "explanation": "Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test. Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification. Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least rational to believe that it also serves the state\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is required to sustain the statute. Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state\u2019s citizens and to the citizens of other states.",

Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.   Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard.

The manufacturer received the order and promptly shipped the laptops. However, the manufacturer also sent an acknowledgment form to the retailer four days later, excluding consequential damages.\n\n### Rule application\nAccording to the UCC, a contract is formed when the parties agree upon the essential terms and each party makes a promise to the other.

Here, the shipment of the laptops constituted the manufacturer\u2019s acceptance of the retailer\u2019s offer and the terms set forth in the offer. Answer A is incorrect. The manufacturer\u2019s shipment of the laptops was a reasonable mode of acceptance and gave rise to a contract. Answer B is incorrect. The retailer\u2019s order constituted an offer, and a contract was formed when the manufacturer shipped the laptops. Therefore, the exclusion of consequential damages in the manufacturer\u2019s acknowledgment constituted a request to modify that contract. The exclusion would become a term of the parties\u2019 agreement if the retailer assented to it, which did not occur here.   Answer D is incorrect.

The day after the husband\u2019s funeral, the brother and his attorney visited the wife at the farm. The brother again told the wife that he wanted to buy the farm and told her that she would need the proceeds of the sale to support her children. The brother also said that his attorney had drafted an offer to purchase the farm and that the wife needed to sign it right away. The attorney confirmed the need to accept quickly. The wife reluctantly signed the offer and sold the farm to the brother for its fair market value. A few days after the sale, the wife learned that her husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout and that she had not needed to sell the farm to support her children.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nUnconscionability in contract law, specifically the concept of overreaching and its application to contracts for the sale of land.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe brother, with the assistance of his attorney, pressured the wife to sign an offer to sell her farm at a fair market value. The wife was reluctant to sell but did so out of a perceived need to support her children after her husband's death. However, it turned out that the husband had a life insurance policy that would provide her with a substantial payout.\n\n### Rule application\nUnconscionability in contract law is based on the idea that parties to a contract should be on equal footing and that contracts should not be enforced if one party is significantly disadvantaged. In this scenario, the brother and his attorney overreached by pressuring the wife to sell the farm at a time when she was emotionally vulnerable and did not need to do so.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the brother and his attorney used undue influence to pressure the wife into selling the farm, which was not necessary for her or her children's support, rescission of the contract would be the wife's strongest option.

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused.

The parties agreed that the price would increase by the amount that the cost of lumber for the job exceeded the then-current cost of $30 per 100 board feet. The landowner reduced the agreement to writing but inadvertently failed to include in the written contract the price- escalation clause relating to the cost of lumber. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor purchased lumber for the job, the price of the lumber had risen to $60 per 100 board feet. When the contractor submitted a final bill that included the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the increased price for the lumber on the grounds that the price-escalation clause was missing from the written contract. If the contractor sues the landowner to recover the additional cost, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contractor\u2019s remedy for mistake is avoidance of the contract.\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule will bar introduction of evidence of the price-escalation clause.\nC.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nConsideration in contract law, specifically the enforceability of price-escalation clauses in written agreements.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe landowner and the contractor agreed to a written contract for the construction of a wood-frame house. The contractor's price was to increase by the amount that the cost of lumber exceeded $30 per 100 board feet. However, the written contract omitted this price-escalation clause. Both parties signed the contract without noticing the omission. When the contractor submitted a final bill including the increased price of lumber, the landowner refused to pay the additional cost. The landowner's refusal was based on the absence of the price-escalation clause in the written contract.\n\n### Rule application\nA price-escalation clause in a written agreement is enforceable if the contract allows for adjustment of the contract price in response to a specified change in the cost of goods or services. The parol evidence rule generally bars the introduction of evidence of a prior oral agreement, but this rule does not apply to writings offered to prove the contents of a disputed writing. Since both parties were mistaken as to the content of the writing, the court may reform the writing to express the parties' agreement.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the price-escalation clause was a modification to a written contract and both parties were mistaken as to its inclusion, the court may reform the contract to reflect the parties' agreement.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality\u2019s project and knew that the firm could not accept the subcontractor\u2019s offer until the municipality accepted the firm\u2019s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the   effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757 (1958). Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor\u2019s offer. Therefore, the firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor\u2019s bid. Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm\u2019s reliance kept the subcontractor\u2019s bid open as an option contract. Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of recovery for breach. Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance, detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what happened here with the subcontractor\u2019s bid.",

When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man's conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because he was committing a felony.\nC.

By state statute, any purchaser of a funeral plan of this sort can cancel the purchase at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 15% of the purchase price. A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau. The established cemetery has sued the former employee for tortious interference with contract. The former employee has moved for summary judgment, based on the foregoing facts. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former employee bribed purchasers in order to take business from the established cemetery.\nB. No, because the former employee could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the established cemetery\u2019s contracts.\nC.

Several purchasers took advantage of this offer and canceled their plans with the established cemetery, leading to a dispute over refunds and threats to notify the state consumer protection bureau.\n\n### Rule application\nTortious interference with contract is established when the defendant intentionally and improperly interferes with the plaintiff's contractual relations. The defendant's postcard promotion, which encouraged purchasers to cancel their contracts with the established cemetery for the purpose of switching to the new cemetery, meets this standard.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the former employee's postcard promotion encouraged purchasers to cancel their contracts with the established cemetery for personal gain, the defendant has committed tortious interference with contract.

The tree specialist\u2019s action meets the definition of conversion regardless of the fact that he was directed to take that action by the landowner. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The buyer intentionally shoved the employee, which satisfies the prima facie case for battery. As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should deny the buyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Answer B is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the laptop, not the car. Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances. Answer D is incorrect. The buyer\u2019s compliance with the employee\u2019s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer\u2019s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.",

The rocket's defective design was the proximate cause of the injury.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder strict products liability, a manufacturer is liable for a defect in design if the defect makes the product unreasonably dangerous and the defect was present at the time of sale. In this scenario, the rocket's defective design was the proximate cause of the spectator's injury, and the rocket was sold to the amusement park prior to the incident.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the rocket's defective design was the proximate cause of the spectator's injury, and the design defect was present at the time of sale to the amusement park, the park is liable for the spectator's damages under strict products liability. Therefore, the correct theory for obtaining a summary judgment as to liability is strict products liability, supporting option D.\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A landowner contracted in a signed writing to sell Greenacre a 500-acre tract of farmland to a farmer.

On January 15 landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30 the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. Throughout the month of January the market value of Greenacre was $510000 and its fair monthly rental value was $5000. On January 30 the farmer accepted a conveyance and possession of Greenacre and paid the $500000000 required by the contract.

Even though the spectator might not obtain summary judgment on a claim of liability for an abnormally dangerous activity, that claim\u2014which imposes strict liability for injuries caused by an activity that is not commonplace and that remains dangerous to bystanders even when the actor uses reasonable care to avoid causing injuries\u2014provides the spectator with the best chance of doing so. Answer B is incorrect. The spectator was injured in an accident: the amusement park did not intend to touch the spectator in a harmful or offensive manner, as is required for battery liability. Answer C is incorrect. The spectator suffered personal injuries. The tort of nuisance imposes liability for unreasonable interference with another person\u2019s use or enjoyment of their property. Answer D is incorrect. The doctrine of strict products liability applies only to commercial sellers of defective products that cause injury, and there is nothing in the question to suggest that the amusement park\u2014the only defendant in the action\u2014was in the business of selling fireworks.",

Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.\nB. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.\nC. It is not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in places that are visible to neighbors.\nD.

The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, but the farmer refused. The homeowner is concerned about the impact on the resale value of her property.\n\n### Rule application\nTo establish a claim for private nuisance, a property owner must demonstrate that another's actions have caused a substantial and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of their property. The farmer's actions of keeping unsightly items on their property may not physically encroach on the homeowner's land, but they can still interfere with the homeowner's use and enjoyment of her property.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the farmer's actions have caused a substantial and unreasonable interference with the homeowner's use and enjoyment of her property, the farmer's best defense against liability would be that unsightly conditions do not of themselves amount to an unreasonable interference with neighboring property.

The landowner entered into a written contract with a builder to build a house of stated specifications on Richacre and to sell the house and lot to the builder. The contract provided for an \"inside date\" of April 1 2007 and an \"outside date\" of May 1 2007 for completion of the house and delivery of a deed. Neither party tendered performance on the dates stated. On May 3 2007 the builder notified the landowner in writing of the builder's election to cancel the contract because of the landowner's failure to deliver title by May 1 . On May 12 the landowner notified the builder that some unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that the landowner was entitled to a reasonable time to complete. The notification also included a promise that the landowner would be ready to perform by May 29 and that he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date. The landowner obtained a certificate of occupancy and appropriate documents of title and he tendered performance on May 29. The builder refused. The landowner brought an action to recover damages for breach of contract.",

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held that a defendant\u2019s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance   liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer\u2019s best argument. Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property. Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person\u2019s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor\u2019s yard, that person may be subject to liability for nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor\u2019s property. Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner\u2019s claim that the farmer\u2019s placement of the unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.",

The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease. The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff\u2019s respiratory disease. The company has objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease. Should the court allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify at trial?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the contractor and the homeowner, because neither posted a warning that the porch boards had been loosened.\nB. Neither the homeowner nor the contractor, because the friend was a licensee.\nC. The contractor only, because he was an independent contractor and he loosened the boards in a dangerously deceptive fashion without posting a warning.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nTorts\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nNegligence liability of a homeowner and a contractor for a friend's injury caused by loosened porch boards.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe homeowner asked the contractor to loosen some porch boards to allow for the installation of new ones. The contractor complied by using a hammer to drive nails into the boards, causing them to become loose. The friend was invited by the homeowner to sit on the porch and was leaning against a loose board when she fell and injured herself.\n\n### Rule application\nNegligence liability of a contractor and a homeowner turns on whether they acted with reasonable care in causing the boards to become loose. A contractor's actions may be considered negligent if he fails to use reasonable care in performing a task requested by a homeowner. A homeowner's actions may be considered negligent if she asks a contractor to perform a task that involves a risk of harm to others and does not take reasonable steps to prevent such harm.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the contractor used a hammer to drive nails into the boards, causing them to become loose, and that the homeowner invited the friend to sit on the porch and lean against a loose board, the homeowner and the contractor may be found negligent. The homeowner's negligence is more direct, as she asked the contractor to loosen the boards.

The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The defense attorney should have immediately objected when the witness related inadmissible hearsay. An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103. In addition, the delayed objection failed to preserve the right to appeal, because the defense attorney did not state a specific basis for the objection under FRE 103. Answer A is incorrect. Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to strike at the first opportunity\u2014even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury\u2014may be timely pursuant to FRE 103. Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for   appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case. Answer D is incorrect. An objection must be made at the earliest opportunity under FRE 103, and an objection that is made \u201cduring trial\u201d but not while the witness is still on the stand is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.",

Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic evidence that it was made would be most useful. Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose.

The witness would testify about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement, and the defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery. There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement. Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal defendant\u2019s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature. Answer C is incorrect. The defendant\u2019s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only statements of a declarant\u2019s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant\u2019s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind exception. Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a \u201cprior consistent\u201d statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness.

Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) admits only \u201cpre-motive\u201d statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant\u2019s statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility.",

The defendant objects to the story's admissibility due to lack of authentication and as hearsay.\n\n### Rule application\nHearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy.   Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require separate authentication to be admitted into evidence. Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See FRE 801(c)(2). Answer C is incorrect. Because the newspaper story is not offered for its truth, but rather to demonstrate notice of the plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy, it is not hearsay, and no hearsay exception is required for its admission.

The friend opened a tavern on the property, and six months later the municipality condemned the property for a highway interchange.\n\n### Rule application\nThe doctrine of partial takings allows a court to sever a partial interest when a property is condemned, preserving the remainder for the owner. In this scenario, the court would likely uphold the severance of the alcoholic beverage restriction, leaving the friend with a possessory interest in the property.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the alcoholic beverage restriction was a personal restriction on the friend's use of the property, it is likely that the court would uphold its severance.

The nephew recorded the deed but remained unmarried. The woman later died testate, leaving her entire estate to her sister. The executor of the estate has asserted that the nephew has no interest in the home.\n\n### Rule application\nA warranty deed is a type of real estate conveyance that guarantees the title to the grantee. In this scenario, the deed to the nephew was made contingent upon his marriage, which means that the vested remainder was dependent on a future event. If the nephew had married before the woman's death, he would have become the owner of the home. However, since he remained unmarried, his interest was contingent upon the woman's death.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nThe death of the grantor invalidates a contingent remainder in a warranty deed. Therefore, the nephew had no interest in the home after the woman's death. The correct verdict is that the executor is correct and that the nephew has no interest in the home.

The landowner handed the instrument to the friend, saying, \"This is yours, but please do not record it until after I am dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives.\" Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed. The friend said that he would destroy the deed and a day or so later falsely told the landowner that the deed had been destroyed. Six months later, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestate, survived by a daughter as his sole heir at law. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him. As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land. For whom should the court hold?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter, because the death of the landowner deprived the land",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct because the woman conveyed a springing executory interest to the nephew while retaining a fee simple subject to executory limitation. The woman\u2019s death did not affect the nephew\u2019s springing executory interest, and her estate now holds the fee simple subject to executory limitation. When and if the nephew marries, his executory interest will vest in fee simple. If the nephew dies unmarried, the sister\u2019s interest will swell into a fee simple. Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the nephew recorded the deed provided constructive notice to the world of his interest but did not affect his interest. The nephew received a springing executory interest and the woman held a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Answer C is incorrect. The nephew received a future interest that will vest when he marries. The woman\u2019s death did not invalidate the nephew\u2019s springing executory interest. Answer D is incorrect. The nephew received a springing executory interest. The warranty deed did not require the nephew to marry before the death of the woman.",

The friend refused, claiming that he owned the land and that the payments the woman had made over the preceding 10 years were rent, not loan repayments. The woman sued to compel the friend to convey the land to her. Is she likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a rebuttable presumption arises under these facts that the transaction was a lease, and the presumption has not been rebutted.\nB.

He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man's conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because he was committing a felony.\nC. No, because the instruction wrongly described the necessary mental state.\nD.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer owned the land and no interest passed to her son. Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city\u2019s actions permissible; the woman could have filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed. Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred here. Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.",

The woman later sold the land to a buyer, who was not aware of the easement at the time of purchase. After taking possession, the buyer attempted to use the easement as described in the deed but was blocked by a fence constructed by the man.\n\n### Rule application\nAn easement is a property right that allows a landowner to use another's land for a specific purpose. Appurtenant easements are those that are attached to a particular parcel of land and pass to the land's new owner as a result of a conveyance. In contrast, easements in gross are those that benefit a single individual and do not transfer to subsequent landowners.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the easement was created to benefit the woman and her heirs and assigns, it is an appurtenant easement. As such, it is a property right that passes to the buyer as a result of the woman's land conveyance.

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder.

When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm.

The mortgage was promptly recorded. Six months later, the bank assigned only the promissory note to an investor. The assignment made no express reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The bank immediately sent the buyer a notice of the assignment, which provided the address of the investor and explained that the bank was no longer servicing the loan. The buyer made timely payments to the investor for two years but then defaulted on the loan. After the buyer failed to cure the default, the investor accelerated the debt and commenced a foreclosure action. The buyer\u2019s defense in the foreclosure action is that the investor is not the mortgagee and therefore has no right to foreclose. Does the investor have the right to foreclose?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mortgage did not automatically accompany the assignment of the note to the investor.\nB. No, because the mortgage was extinguished when the bank assigned and transferred only the note to the investor.\nC. Yes, because the investor became the owner of both the note and the mortgage by virtue of the assignment of the note to him.\nD. Yes, because the public land records continue to show the investor\u2019s predecessor in title as the mortgagee.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

The assignment made no reference to the mortgage and was not recorded in the public land records. The investor became the note holder but not the mortgagee.\n\n### Rule application\nA mortgage is a lien on real property as security for a debt, while a note is a promise to pay a debt. An assignment of a note does not transfer a mortgage, and a mortgage does not pass by operation of law. To foreclose a mortgage, a person must be the mortgagee, which requires both a valid assignment of the mortgage and recording of the assignment in the public land records.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nSince the investor did not become the mortgagee upon the bank's assignment of the note to him, he cannot foreclose the mortgage. The buyer's default and the investor's right to accelerate the debt were not affected by this lack of mortgage ownership.\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A landowner owned a vacant lot known as Richacre.

The corpus of the fund was invested in certificates of deposit and high-grade bonds. When one of the certificates of deposit, in the amount of $100,000, matured, the woman cashed the certificate and invested the proceeds under her own name in a speculative stock. In three months, the value of the stock had soared, and the woman sold the stock for $200,000. With the proceeds of the sale, the woman purchased a $120,000 certificate of deposit in the name of the trust. She gave the remaining $80,000 to charity. The woman is charged with embezzlement. Under the applicable statute, the degree of the crime (and, hence, the severity of the authorized punishment) depends upon the value of the property embezzled. Of what crime, if any, could the woman properly be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Embezzlement of $200,000.\nB. Embezzlement of $100,000.\nC. Embezzlement of $80,000.\nD.

        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nEmbezzlement under common law, specifically the elements required to establish the crime of embezzlement.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe woman, as trustee, cashed a $100,000 certificate of deposit and invested the proceeds in a speculative stock. The stock's value subsequently increased to $200,000, and the woman sold it. The woman then used the $80,000 remaining from the sale to purchase a certificate of deposit in the name of the trust.\n\n### Rule application\nUnder common law, embezzlement is established when a person converts property to his or her own use with intent to permanently deprive the owner. The crime is based on the value of the property embezzled, and the degree of the crime (and, hence, the severity of the authorized punishment) depends on this value.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the woman cashed a $100,000 certificate of deposit and invested the proceeds in a speculative stock, she potentially committed embezzlement of $200,000. However, by using the remaining $80,000 to purchase a certificate of deposit in the name of the trust, she mitigated the damage and did not permanently deprive the owner of the funds.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee, the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the woman converted it to her own use. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant\u2019s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or increased. Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is not the amount that the woman embezzled. Answer D is incorrect because the woman did embezzle $100,000; see the explanation for answer B.",

Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not constitute a lesser-offense instruction. Answer C is incorrect.

Under the controlling state\u2019s criminal law, the crime of aggravated theft, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, requires that the stolen property be worth $1,000 or more. If the stolen property is worth less than $1,000, the crime is simple theft with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The value of the equipment was disputed.

Answer A is incorrect because the facts do not show that the man took sufficient steps toward completing a murder. The man did nothing but offer to pay, and this conduct is not \u201cdangerously proximate\u201d to the commission of the offense as required by the common law. Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man\u2019s offer, given the undercover officer\u2019s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony. Additionally, the facts do not establish a misprision. That offense   occurs when a person fails to inform the authorities about a felony that the person knows about.",

Upon arriving, they saw a man inside the home who was bleeding and agitated, but no other persons. The man refused to speak to the officers and pointed a shotgun at them. The officers withdrew but later arrested the man for assault on a police officer. The man now seeks to suppress the officers' testimony, alleging the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\n### Rule application\nThe emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment allows police to enter a home without a warrant to provide aid to a homeowner in distress.

However, the man's invocation of his right to a warrant by inviting the police to leave after they entered the home invalidated the exception's application.

The defendant, now charged with sexual assault, has moved to suppress the DNA sample as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court suppress the DNA sample?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the defendant failed to lodge a timely objection to the sample collection.\nB. No, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nC. No, because the statute violates the Fourth Amendment, but the police acted in good-faith reliance upon it.\nD. Yes, because the statute requiring collection of DNA samples from felony arrestees violates the Fourth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "response": "\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nThe Fourth Amendment implications of a state law requiring DNA sampling from felony arrestees, specifically the application of the good-faith exception to suppression law.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe defendant was arrested for burglary and provided a DNA sample upon police request. The defendant was later acquitted of the burglary charge but was later charged with sexual assault based on a DNA match to an unsolved crime. The defendant moved to suppress the use of their DNA in the sexual assault investigation.\n\n### Rule application\nThe good-faith exception to suppression law applies when police act in accordance with a valid statute, despite a finding that the statute violates the Fourth Amendment. The exception recognizes that police may not be aware of constitutional limitations and that compliance with a valid statute provides a reasonable basis for conduct.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the state law requiring DNA sampling from felony arrestees is valid under the Fourth Amendment, the good-faith exception would apply to the defendant's scenario. Therefore, the court should not suppress the DNA sample, supporting option B.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\n  A man decided to steal a car he saw parked on a hill. When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man's conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because he was committing a felony.\nC. No, because the instruction wrongly described the necessary mental state.\nD. No, because it would violate double jeopardy to convict the man of malicious damage of property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n##",

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\n\nResponse:\n\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Legal concept\nSelf-defense in criminal law, particularly the justification of using deadly force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n### Fact analysis\nThe husband entered the bedroom where the neighbor and the separated wife were sitting and aggressively demanded the neighbor leave, escalating the confrontation by inviting him to fight outside. When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.\n\n### Rule application\nSelf-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B.\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n\n<</SYS>>\nQuestion:\nAssigned counsel for a capital defendant had heard that his client had an unsavory background and a highly dysfunctional childhood. He was reluctant to delve into the details for fear that they might reflect poorly on his client, and he decided not to investigate. After his client was convicted, counsel presented a penalty phase defense that repeated the denials of the liability phase. The jury returned a death sentence. After exhausting state remedies, the defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his sordid upbringing. If the court finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence, if presented, would have affected the jury\u2019s sentence, should the court grant the petition?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the decision not to probe into the defendant\u2019s background was part of the defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\nB. No, because defense counsel is required to adhere only to an objective standard of reasonableness in representing a criminal defendant in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nC. Yes, because defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s life history for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Yes, because defense counsel is required to present any known mitigating factors in the penalty phase of a capital murder case.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Washington, defense counsel must provide effective assistance by investigating and presenting mitigating evidence to the jury in the penalty phase of a capital trial. Counsel's failure to do so constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n### Legal Conclusion\nGiven that defense counsel's failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence in the penalty phase led to a death sentence, the court should grant the petition if it finds a reasonable probability that the mitigating evidence would have affected the jury's sentence.

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and that failure was prejudicial. Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel\u2019s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable. Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here, however, counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable. Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.",
