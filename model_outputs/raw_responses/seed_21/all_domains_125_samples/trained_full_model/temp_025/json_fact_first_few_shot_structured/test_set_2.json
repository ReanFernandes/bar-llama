Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law effects a taking of property without just compensation.\nB.

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner\u2019s interest in real property. It does not matter that the owner\u2019s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties. Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state\u2019s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas. Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual\u2019s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of the federal Constitution. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual\u2019s property, even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder. The mayor, however, vetoed the selection and chose a contractor from farther away, at a much higher price. State law does not require selection of the lowest bidder. Is the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the mayor\u2019s action in choosing a higher-cost bidder over a lower-cost bidder has no rational basis.\nB. No, because the mayor\u2019s action is a violation of the owner\u2019s right to freedom of expression and association.\nC. Yes, because state law does not require selection of the lowest bidder.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making. Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time. Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant to the determination whether the mayor\u2019s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such      beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction. Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure that the contractor\u2019s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the contractor\u2019s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor\u2019s political conduct is irrelevant to the type of work in question.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct because on its face the ordinance discriminates against commerce from outside the city. By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory. Such facially discriminatory laws are allowed only in the absence of any nondiscriminatory way to promote the government\u2019s interest. C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994). Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it with a legitimate government interest. Answer C is incorrect. Because the law is facially discriminatory, it is not subject to the \u201cundue burden\u201d test.

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the owner\u2019s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land. Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here. Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue. Answer D is incorrect.

            "explanation": "Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there. Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny. The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.",

His neighbor owned the adjoining Lot 2 in the same plan. The plat of the subdivision was recorded as authorized by statute. Twelve years ago, the landowner erected an industrial building wholly situated on Lot 1 but with one wall along the boundary common with Lot 2. Further, the landowner dug a channel from the building across a portion of Lot 2 to a water source and then back to the building across the remainder of Lot 2. The excavation was filled with sand and gravel and a floor was laid. The building was then constructed on the remaining portion of Lot 1. The landowner then obtained a building permit to construct a second story to the building. The building inspector refused to issue a building permit for the second story because, in his opinion, the first story was not in compliance with the zoning ordinance. The landowner sued the building inspector to compel issuance of the building permit. For which of the following reasons is the landowner's suit likely to be unsuccessful?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landowner did not obtain a variance to construct the building.\nB. The landowner's use of the premises is not industrial.\nC. The zoning ordinance is valid and enforceable by prosecution.\nD.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional. Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants\u2019 freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and intimate. Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations is not the proper standard. Because the government is demanding public access to the property in exchange for a permit to build, the test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development. Answer D is incorrect. Whether or not the condition substantially advances a legitimate interest of the city is not the proper standard. The proper test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing harms caused by the new development.",

That lawful conduct gave rise to an exigency\u2014the concern that evidence was being destroyed\u2014that justified the warrantless entry. Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to justify the warrantless entry. Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency. Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the police conduct\u2014knocking and announcing their presence\u2014was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. A Miranda warning is required whenever a suspect is (1) in custody and (2) being subjected to custodial interrogation. Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in      Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is not met simply because a probationer or parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d only when under \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is not enough. The suspect also must be in custody. Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was one year\u2019s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement. Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true\u2014namely, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the \u201cthird party doctrine\u201d\u2014the Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data. Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.      Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Second, Carpenter held that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.",

However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the woman\u2019s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son\u2019s murder. The charges need not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense. Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory of liability. Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing.

An intended beneficiary can enforce a contract to which it is not a party, because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302. However, one party to the contract can assert, against the beneficiary, claims for breach by the other party to the contract. Here, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to perform the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for breach of that promise against the bank. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 309(2). Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter\u2019s promise to do the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for damages against the bank, as an intended beneficiary.

Instead the bank is an intended beneficiary that can enforce a contract to which it is not a party because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary.

And even if the carpenter\u2019s breach was material, the bank could recover the value of the work done for the homeowner as restitution. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374.",

This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for having laid the foundation.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A trial judge who is concerned about a party\u2019s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses. Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a party\u2019s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake. Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof, they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of presentation. Answer D is incorrect. The trial judge has the discretion to alter the order of proof without a showing of specific prejudice by an opposing party.",

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Because the fire marshal is a public official and his conclusion about the cause of the fire is a factual finding based upon an official investigation, the report is admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. The witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception, however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement must be excised from the report. Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness\u2019s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under      a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted. Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation protects defendants only in criminal cases and so does not protect the neighbor in this civil action. Answer D is incorrect. Public officials may rely on bystander statements and hearsay in making factual findings. To the extent that a public official\u2019s factual findings rest on only such hearsay, those findings could be excluded for a lack of trustworthiness under FRE 803(8)(B). Here, the fire marshal\u2019s factual findings rest on his significant experience, as well as his examination of the scene, and would not be excludable solely due to reliance on some hearsay.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The routine practice of the company\u2019s agents in discussing supplemental policy options with customers is admissible under FRE 406. Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization\u2019s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual issue for the jury.

            "explanation": "Answer A is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a judgment on the pleadings may be made after the pleadings are closed. However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer, the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions. Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document. Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its primary claim for damages but also on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be premature.",

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent\u2019s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate\u2019s favor, the motion should be granted. Answer A is incorrect. The executor\u2019s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the man\u2019s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor\u2019s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial. Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses\u2019 testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor\u2019s witness did not actually see the accident or any contact between the man\u2019s bike and the decedent\u2019s bike, and the man\u2019s witnesses testified that they never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute. Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.",

            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts. Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims. Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b). Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.",

Answer B is incorrect. The woman\u2019s intent is irrelevant. When a will specifically disposes of land not owned by the testator at death, the bequest to the specific legatee adeems (fails). Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the will was written before the mortgage was granted is irrelevant to the question of ademption.",

At issue is whether the entrepreneur had record (constructive) notice of the restriction. If so, the entrepreneur would not be a good-faith purchaser for value. Courts are divided about whether a buyer is required to search deeds outside of the chain of title to the land the buyer is purchasing. Here, the deed from the man to the woman is outside of the entrepreneur\u2019s chain of title even though they share a common grantor. Thus, knowing whether the jurisdiction\u2019s law puts a buyer on notice of all land transfers of the buyer\u2019s grantor, even those outside of the chain of title, is essential. If it does, the entrepreneur had a duty to search the title for the westerly tract. Answer A is incorrect. The type of index does not determine what instruments are in the chain of title.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action. At the time of the acceleration, the owner was current on all loan payments. There is no applicable statute. Did the lender have the right to accelerate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owner promptly tendered the delinquent payment amount to the lender.\nB. No, because the owner\u2019s casualty insurance policy had been reinstated.\nC.

While typically triggered by nonpayment of the mortgage debt, they can also be triggered by the mortgagor\u2019s failure to satisfy other conditions in the mortgage, such as timely payment of insurance premiums.

Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire accelerated amount. Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A. Answer C is incorrect.

Before the closing, the buyer\u2019s attorney advised him to purchase a standard-form, $300,000 title insurance policy naming the buyer as the insured. Because the buyer had forgotten to bring his checkbook to the closing, his son, who had accompanied him to the closing, paid the premium for him. One year later, the buyer died. Under his will, the house passed to his son. Two years later, the son was successfully sued by a previous record owner with a superior title to the house. The previous owner\u2019s claim had not been excepted in the buyer\u2019s title insurance policy through the carelessness of a title company employee. At the time of the lawsuit, the house was still subject to the bank\u2019s mortgage. The son immediately sought indemnification for the loss from the title insurance company. Is the son entitled to indemnification from the title insurance company?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the son was not named as an insured on the title policy.\nB.

He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business. A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it. When the bank learned of the man\u2019s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums. After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other.

While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by deed\u201d or \u201cafter-acquired property.\u201d Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple to the purchaser (the son\u2019s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired it from the son.      Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the daughter\u2019s life estate (and the purchaser\u2019s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter\u2019s death.

This, combined with the undetectable nature of the defect, supports a claim for strict products liability. However, a claim for battery cannot be based on this same set of facts.

            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. The driver might have a valid strict products liability claim against the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support a finding\u2014required for battery liability\u2014that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer\u2019s partial summary judgment motion.      Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability. Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of those ruptures. Answer C is incorrect. There is no rule of tort law stating that a plaintiff is prohibited from pursuing claims for battery and products liability on the basis of the same set of facts.",

A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a finished product by the product\u2019s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the component is what rendered the finished product defective.

A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability. Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver.

Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim. Answer D is incorrect.

Negligence causing \u201cpure\u201d emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the \u201czone of danger\u201d) or when a certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient).

The manufacturer knew that the distributor would, on the basis of the agreement, invest in an expansion of its distribution centers in State A in order to handle the distribution of the manufacturer\u2019s products to retail sellers in that state. At the time the manufacturer entered into the contract, it had already firmly decided to withdraw from the State A market in two years. Because the distributor had heard rumors of such a plan, its chief executive officer, before signing the contract, asked a representative of the manufacturer whether such a plan was in place. The representative denied the existence of any such plan. Two years into the contract, the manufacturer announced that it no longer intended to sell products in State A and canceled its contract with the distributor. The manufacturer did not thereafter supply products for distribution or sale in State A. Does the distributor have a viable fraud claim against the manufacturer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the distributor\u2019s exclusive remedy is for breach of contract.\nB. No, because the manufacturer did not misstate any material facts when entering into the contract.\nC.

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer\u2019s defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine\u2014which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians\u2014has no application in this case, which involves the      sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its defense of the action. Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer\u2019s failure to list the coating\u2019s ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there is no duty to warn.) Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter\u2019s injury because the mother\u2019s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding) cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother\u2019s knowledge of the daughter\u2019s allergy, the mother\u2019s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.",

Under the sponsorship agreement, the dealership was required to arrange for licensed and trained emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to be present during the race. The dealership contracted with a licensed and reputable emergency medical services (EMS) firm that supplied EMTs for events such as these. A motorcyclist participating in the race was injured when he lost control of his motorcycle. The motorcyclist was treated at the scene by the EMTs. In removing the motorcyclist\u2019s helmet, one of the EMTs twisted the motorcyclist\u2019s neck, causing him to become permanently paralyzed. The motorcyclist has sued both the EMS firm and the dealership, alleging that the EMT\u2019s careless conduct caused his paralysis. Assuming the validity of the motorcyclist\u2019s negligence claim against the EMS firm, which of the following best characterizes the dealership\u2019s potential liability?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The dealership is directly liable for hiring the EMS firm.\nB. The dealership is vicariously liable, because it owed a nondelegable duty to provide emergency care for the race.\nC. The dealership is vicariously liable, because the EMT was careless in the course of her employment.\nD. The dealership is neither directly liable nor vicariously liable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction wrongly described the necessary mental state. That argument should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. rejected, because the instruction was a correct statement of the law.\nB. rejected, because the instruction was a correct statement of the law, and the man's intent to ste",

            "correct_answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Answer D is correct. Because the dealership\u2019s duty of care was delegable, because the dealership was not negligent in hiring the EMS firm, and because the EMT was not an employee of the dealership, there is no basis for holding the dealership liable, whether directly or vicariously. Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is also no basis for direct liability. Answer B is incorrect. The duty to provide competent medical care was properly delegated to the EMS firm. Answer C is incorrect. Because the EMT was an employee only of the EMS firm, not the dealership, any carelessness by the EMT could be imputed only to the EMS firm.",
