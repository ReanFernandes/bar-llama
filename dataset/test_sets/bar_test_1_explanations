Answer to Question 1.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Determining diversity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is done with reference to
the citizenship of the adverse parties. Here, because the party in question is a corporate entity, its citizenship is determined
by where it is incorporated and the location of its principal place of business, which the US Supreme Court has defined as
a company’s headquarters.
Answer A is incorrect. Where a company distributes its cars does not bear on citizenship for purposes of diversity
jurisdiction. Rather, the place of distribution would potentially be relevant to where the company could be subjected to
personal jurisdiction in this action.
Answer B is incorrect. The concept of minimum contacts is relevant to determinations of personal jurisdiction, not
subject-matter jurisdiction, which is what the question asks about here.
Answer D is incorrect. Before the US Supreme Court’s decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the
circuits took varying approaches to determining the location of a corporation’s principal place of business, with some
treating a company’s major place of manufacturing as determinative. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hertz that a
company’s principal place of business for purposes of diversity is the location of its headquarters.
Answer to Question 2.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Tarble’s Case, 80 U.S. 397 (1871), holds that the Supremacy Clause prohibits states
from interfering with federal detention by issuing habeas writs.
Answer B is incorrect. The fact that an arrest was made pursuant to a warrant does not automatically make the arrest
constitutional.
Answer C is incorrect. The governor does not enjoy federal immunity from prosecution for violating federal laws while
in office.
Answer D is incorrect. The inability of state courts to issue habeas writs against federal detentions does not violate the
Suspension Clause because federal courts are still able to issue such writs.
Answer to Question 3.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The retailer’s order constituted an offer. Under UCC § 2-206, an offer made by an
order of goods may be accepted by the shipment of goods or by a prompt promise to ship. Here, the shipment of the
laptops constituted the manufacturer’s acceptance of the retailer’s offer and the terms set forth in the offer.
Answer A is incorrect. The manufacturer’s shipment of the laptops was a reasonable mode of acceptance and gave rise to
a contract.
Answer B is incorrect. The retailer’s order constituted an offer, and a contract was formed when the manufacturer
shipped the laptops. Therefore, the exclusion of consequential damages in the manufacturer’s acknowledgment constituted
a request to modify that contract. The exclusion would become a term of the parties’ agreement if the retailer assented to
it, which did not occur here.


Answer D is incorrect. This response assumes that the parties formed a contract under UCC § 2-207(3) by their conduct.
Here a contract was formed when the manufacturer shipped the laptops and thereby accepted the retailer’s offer.
Answer to Question 4.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The company’s best argument against liability is that it has no duty to protect people
from being injured by third parties who intentionally misuse its site, which merely provides a platform for transactions
between individuals.
Answer B is incorrect. The question asks for the company’s strongest defense. If the company had owed a duty to the
homeowner, it could argue that the cousin’s actions were a proximate cause of the homeowner’s loss. But a stronger
defense is that the company owed no duty to the homeowner.
Answer C is incorrect. The First Amendment limits tort liability in some contexts but does not prohibit all tort actions
just because there is a speech component to the defendant’s actions.
Answer D is incorrect. Again, the question asks for the company’s strongest defense. The question of whether a
defendant has acted with reasonable care is usually a fact-intensive question that a jury resolves, but if a defendant can
show that it had no duty, the court need not advance the case to a jury trial to determine whether there was carelessness.
Answer to Question 5.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Evidence of the defendant’s intent to flee satisfies FRE 401’s definition of relevance:
it shows his consciousness of guilt and makes his guilt more probable than it would be without the evidence.
Answer A is incorrect. FRE 401 defines relevance as evidence having “any tendency to make a fact [of consequence]
more probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evidence that the defendant tried to flee from prosecution—that he
purchased an airplane ticket to another country using an alias—satisfies the definition of relevance, because it shows his
consciousness of guilt.
Answer B is incorrect. Evidence of an intent to flee is relevant to show the defendant’s consciousness of guilt but not to
show his motive to commit the crime. The defendant’s attempt to flee the jurisdiction after his arrest sheds no light on his
motive to commit the crime.
Answer D is incorrect. Proof of motive is generally relevant and admissible, but evidence of the defendant’s intent to flee
after his arrest sheds no light on his motive to commit the crime. Because the evidence is irrelevant to motive, it is
inadmissible if offered to prove motive.
Answer to Question 6.
Explanation: Answer D is correct because the grantor conveyed a fee simple determinable to the friend, reserving a
possibility of reverter. When the defeasible event occurred (selling alcoholic beverages), the fee simple determinable
immediately terminated and title vested in the grantor.
Answer A is incorrect. While it is true that both the friend and the grantor had an interest in the property, when the
defeasible event occurred (selling alcoholic beverages), the friend’s fee simple determinable immediately terminated and
title vested in the grantor, who had a possibility of reverter.
Answer B is incorrect. Even though the friend was in physical possession of the property on the date of the
condemnation, legal title to the property was in the grantor.


Answer C is incorrect. The limitation contained in the deed, prohibiting the sale of alcohol, is not an invalid restraint nor
against public policy.
Answer to Question 7.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. As long as a plaintiff presents a colorable claim under federal law, it will be
sufficient to support supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the same case or controversy. The
dismissal of the federal claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, though the
court, in its discretion, might rely on the dismissal as a reason to discontinue hearing the state-law claim.
Answer B is incorrect. Supplemental jurisdiction is a discretionary doctrine, meaning that a court is never obligated to
exercise it, even when the state-law claim forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim.
Answer C is incorrect. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred over a claim based on the nature of the
defense raised in response to it. Rather, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the basis for federal subject-matter
jurisdiction must appear on the face of the plaintiff’s complaint.
Answer D is incorrect. Although the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the state-law claim, the court could exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over it because it forms part of the same case or controversy as the federal-law claim. As
discussed above, the dismissal of the federal-law claim did not divest the court of supplemental jurisdiction.
Answer to Question 8.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The homeowner will be deemed to have agreed to the hourly rate set by the plumber
on the website that the homeowner visited.
Answer A is incorrect. This is not a case where there is no agreement as to price, since the plumber’s hourly rate was
available to the homeowner on his website.
Answer C is incorrect. The parties had a bargained-for contract that included the hourly rate set by the plumber, so a
reliance-based measure of damages does not apply.
Answer D is incorrect. The parties had a bargained-for contract that included the hourly rate set by the plumber, so a
restitution-based measure of damages does not apply.
Answer to Question 9.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has consistently rejected claims that the freedom of the press
protected by the First Amendment exempts press activities from laws of general application such as contract law.
Answer A is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the daughter is not a state actor. The requisite state action here is state contract
law, from which the reporter seeks an exemption. The Supreme Court has consistently rejected such claims for exemption.
Answer C is incorrect. The Supreme Court has consistently rejected claims that the freedom of the press protected by the
First Amendment exempts press activities from laws of general application.
Answer D is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the politician is a public figure. It also is irrelevant whether or not the
information was in the public domain. The action here is for breach of contract, and the Supreme Court has consistently
rejected claims that the freedom of the press protected by the First Amendment exempts press activities from laws of


general application.
Answer to Question 10
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Although he did not directly cause the lookout’s death, the supplier can be convicted
as an accomplice. Acting with requisite intent, the supplier encouraged the dealer to commit murder and facilitated the
lookout’s death. Although the supplier and the dealer both believed that death resulted from the shooting, the fact that
death resulted from the fall is neither unforeseeable nor sufficiently disconnected from the scheme to cut the causal chain.
Answer A is incorrect. The facts show that the shooting and the disposal of the body were part of the same scheme or
plan devised by the supplier and the dealer, which was to purposefully aid each other in killing the lookout. Consequently,
the supplier remains responsible for all the acts committed by his accomplice.
Answer B is incorrect because the lookout’s death was clearly intended by both the supplier and the dealer. If the death
was caused by acts committed in furtherance of their scheme, it does not matter that the death occurred in an unanticipated
way.
Answer D is incorrect. The supplier is responsible because he purposefully aided in the killing of the lookout, not
because he subjectively believed that he had killed the lookout.
Answer to Question 11.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Because he was driving a motorcycle—an adult activity—the boy will be held to the
adult standard of care.
Answer B is incorrect. The boy’s status on the land is not relevant to his negligence.
Answer C is incorrect. Whether comparative negligence applies does not impact the standard of care by which the boy’s
conduct will be measured.
Answer D is incorrect. Because the boy was engaged in an adult activity and was not of “tender years,” he will be held to
the adult standard of care.
Answer to Question 12.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Under FRE 502(a), because the disclosure was inadvertent, the waiver does not
extend to undisclosed communications.
Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 502(b), an inadvertent disclosure will not operate as a waiver of the attorney-client
privilege if the holder of the privilege “promptly [takes] reasonable steps to rectify the error.” Here, the manufacturer
learned of the disclosure during discovery but waited until the day before trial to rectify the error. Its response was not
“prompt,” and therefore the disclosure operates as a waiver as to the two documents that were disclosed.
Answer C is incorrect. Under FRE 502(a), because the disclosure was inadvertent, the waiver does not extend to
undisclosed communications—to the other 23 documents—even if they concern the same subject matter.
Answer D is incorrect. FRE 502 applies to “disclosure[s] . . . made in a federal proceeding.” Thus, state law does not
apply, even when federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.


Answer to Question 13.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The mother created an equitable servitude when she conveyed the third lot to her son.
The burden was on the son’s lot (to build only a one-story house), and the benefit was on her retained lot (to preserve her
view of the lake). The equitable servitude was in writing and was recorded, providing constructive notice of it; actual
notice was not required.
Answer A is incorrect. Even though the burden was on the son’s lot (to build only a one-story house) and the benefit was
on the mother’s retained lot, the benefit does not limit the mother to building only a one-story house. The mother was
permitted to build a three-story house on her lot without being estopped from enforcing the covenant against the purchaser
of the son’s lot.
Answer B is incorrect. The son did receive his lot by a deed of gift, and no consideration was given. The mother created
an equitable servitude, which may be by deed of gift, when she conveyed the third lot to her son, and that deed was
recorded, giving constructive notice of the servitude.
Answer D is incorrect. It is irrelevant whether the mother is in privity of contract with the purchaser. The son had privity
of contract with his mother, who created an equitable servitude when she conveyed the third lot to her son.
Answer to Question 14.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. An action is removable if it could have been originally filed in federal court. Here,
the amended complaint contained a claim that qualified for federal-question jurisdiction. Although there also was
diversity jurisdiction, removal was not barred by the forum-defendant rule because that rule bars removal only when
diversity is the only basis for federal jurisdiction.
Answer A is incorrect. The forum-defendant rule only operates to bar removal when diversity is the claimed basis for
federal jurisdiction. Because in this case a claim under federal law had been asserted, the presence of a defendant from the
forum state was not a bar to removal.
Answer B is incorrect. When defendants are served at different times, each defendant gets 30 days to remove from the
time of service. The defendant who removed the case did so within 25 days after being served with the amended
complaint. The removal statutes permit an earlier-served defendant to consent to removal by a later-served defendant even
when the earlier-served defendant had failed to timely remove based on when it was served.
Answer D is incorrect. Although there also was diversity jurisdiction in this case, the presence of a defendant from the
forum state prevented removal based on diversity.
Answer to Question 15.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. On the facts presented, a jury could rationally find that the woman intended to
possess stolen drugs and that she took substantial steps to complete that offense.
Answer A is incorrect because the facts do not suggest that the agents induced the woman to commit an offense that she
otherwise would have been unlikely or unwilling to commit.
Answer B is incorrect because a person can be guilty of attempt even though the circumstances are not what the person
believes them to be.


Answer C is incorrect because the woman constructively possessed the drugs by directing or controlling the agents’
disposition of them.
Answer to Question 16.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Undue influence, or “over-persuasion,” often includes the factors that are found in
these facts, such as an unusual time and place for the persuasion, multiple persuaders, and time pressure.
Answer A is incorrect. Duress requires force or an improper threat, and there was neither one in these facts.
Answer B is incorrect. Any mistake was unilateral, and avoidance of a contract for unilateral mistake requires either that
the other party be aware of the mistake or that enforcement would be unconscionable; neither element is present here.
Answer C is incorrect. Unconscionability requires a lack of bargaining power and an unfair term; neither element is
present here.
Answer to Question 17.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The only relief sought by the company was an injunction against awarding the
contract to another firm. That relief is no longer available, so the case is moot. See Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U.S. 87 (2009);
De Funis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974).
Answer A is incorrect. The company did not seek damages.
Answer C is incorrect. Discretionary decisions of federal officials are not necessarily immune from review by the courts.
Answer D is incorrect. Because the case is moot, the court cannot consider the merits of the dispute.
Answer to Question 18.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Under FRE 702, an expert’s opinion must be based on sufficient facts and data and
the expert must employ a reliable methodology. Here, the expert failed to satisfy those standards. She relied on studies
showing the effects of prolonged exposure to high doses of a similar toxin, when the plaintiff was exposed briefly to small
doses of this particular toxin. The expert also failed to consider recent studies about the toxin in question.
Answer A is incorrect. There is no prohibition on an expert’s relying on studies that were read for purposes of testifying
in the litigation.
Answer C is incorrect. The burden is on the party offering expert testimony to prove the reliability of that testimony by a
preponderance of the evidence.
Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 104(a), the preliminary questions here—the sufficiency of the expert’s basis for her
opinion and the reliability of the expert’s methodology—are for the court to determine by a preponderance of the
evidence.
Answer to Question 19.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. A person who hires an independent contractor ordinarily is not liable for injury to a
third party caused by the contractor’s negligence. However, there is an exception to this rule when the person directly


influences the manner in which the contractor performs the work so as to contribute to the creation of the danger that
causes the third party’s injury. That exception applies in this case and provides a basis for imposing liability on the
homeowner. The contractor, meanwhile, is likely to be held liable under ordinary negligence principles for causing injury
to the friend by failing to warn of the hidden danger posed by the seemingly safe porch floor.
Answers B and C are incorrect for the reasons explained above.
Answer D is incorrect. The explanation for answer A sets out the basis for imposing liability on the homeowner for the
friend’s injury. It further explains that the contractor, who created the danger and negligently failed to warn of it, may also
be found liable. Thus, both the homeowner and the contractor are likely to be held liable to the friend.
Answer to Question 20.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The broker found a prospective buyer who made an offer to purchase the house, but
the woman had a right to reject the offer. The fact that the woman later sold the house to a corporation for the same price
offered by the prospective buyer is irrelevant because it was after the listing agreement had expired and the broker did not
help find the corporation.
Answer A is incorrect. It is not required that a listing agreement be recorded, and listing agreements often are not
recorded.
Answer C is incorrect. The broker did not produce a ready, willing, and able buyer during the term of the listing
agreement because the offer was for an amount less than the listing price in the listing agreement. The broker was not
involved in the sale of the house after the listing agreement had expired.
Answer D is incorrect. The woman was not required to give a reason for rejecting an offer for an amount less than the
listing price made during the listing period.
Answer to Question 21.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The defendant does not have any contacts with State A that are related to this lawsuit.
The defendant is not domiciled in State A and only visits there periodically for reasons unrelated to the plaintiff’s claim.
Answer A is incorrect. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h) permits litigants to raise personal-jurisdiction challenges
for the first time in an answer that is amended as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1). Thus, the defendant timely
asserted the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting it in her amended answer that was filed one week after
the original answer.
Answer B is incorrect. Service within 100 miles of the courthouse where an action is pending is effective to establish
personal jurisdiction only over defendants joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19, not original defendants.
Answer D is incorrect. Personal service under Rule 4 can occur at any location, not just the person’s home. State A
nonetheless lacks personal jurisdiction because the defendant was not served in State A and lacks minimum contacts with
State A, as explained above.
Answer to Question 22.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The absence of agreement on a material term—the executive’s salary—makes the
agreement too indefinite to be enforceable.


Answer A is incorrect. A “lifetime” employment agreement is not subject to the statute of frauds, because it could be
performed within a year if the employee dies within that time period.
Answer C is incorrect. While it is true that a “lifetime” employment agreement is not subject to the statute of frauds,
when the parties fail to expressly agree to an essential term in a contract, there is no requirement that they negotiate for
agreement on that term in good faith.
Answer D is incorrect. A “lifetime” employment agreement does not fall within the statute of frauds, so the confirmation
letter is not necessary to enforce any contract formed. But the parties do not have a binding contract, because they have
not agreed on an essential term—the executive’s salary.
Answer to Question 23.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Under the best evidence rule, the woman cannot testify to the contents of the letter
unless the original is lost and did not become so by her in bad faith. See FRE 1004(a). Because a showing of the letter’s
unavailability has not been made, the woman’s testimony is inadmissible.
Answer A is incorrect. The statements in the letter are not being offered for their truth and so are not hearsay. They are
rather being offered as false and defamatory statements.
Answer C is incorrect. While it is correct that the statements are not hearsay because they are not being offered for their
truth, the woman’s testimony is inadmissible under the best evidence rule.
Answer D is incorrect. While the statements in the letter are those of a party-opponent, the woman’s testimony is
inadmissible under the best evidence rule. Moreover, because the statements are not offered for their truth, they are not
hearsay, and one does not need to invoke FRE 801(d)(2)(A).
Answer to Question 24.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. A jury could find that the former employee intentionally and improperly interfered
with the established cemetery’s contracts by intentionally misrepresenting to the established cemetery’s customers that
they could cancel their existing contracts without penalty.
Answer A is incorrect. Providing a monetary incentive to induce a person to breach a contract is not by itself sufficient to
establish tortious interference with contract.
Answer C is incorrect. The customers’ ability to terminate their contracts does not mean that the former employee could
improperly interfere with those contracts.
Answer D is incorrect. The former employee’s actions in sending the established cemetery’s customers misinformation
about their contracts was not permissible competition but rather improper interference with their contractual relationships
with the established cemetery.
Answer to Question 25.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189 (2012), held that interbranch disputes involving
foreign affairs are not subject to the political question doctrine when they concern the validity of a federal statute.
Answer B is incorrect. Application of the political question doctrine is based on the issue involved in the litigation, not
the identities of the parties.


Answer C is incorrect. Zivotofsky made it clear that the Court may decide cases involving sensitive issues of foreign
affairs when the issue is the constitutionality of a statute.
Answer D is incorrect. There is a judicially manageable standard in this case because the issue is the constitutionality of
the second statute passed by Congress, a purely legal question.
Answer to Question 26.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. This problem poses two related questions: (1) Did the woman commit an
embezzlement; and (2) if so, what amount did she unlawfully take? The answer to the first question is yes. As a trustee,
the woman had lawful possession of property that belonged to the trust fund. Instead of honoring her fiduciary obligation
to the fund, the woman converted the property to her own use. It does not matter that her motives were arguably
charitable. The answer to the second question, how much the woman took, turns on the value of the property at the time of
the commission of the offense. Answer B is correct because the certificate of deposit was worth $100,000 when the
woman converted it to her own use.
Answer A is incorrect because the defendant’s culpability is measured by the value of the property when the crime was
committed, not by its subsequent value. This remains true regardless of whether the embezzled funds are depleted or
increased.
Answer C is incorrect. Even though the trust fund ultimately received all but $80,000 of the ultimate stock sale, that is
not the amount that the woman embezzled.
Answer D is incorrect because the woman did embezzle $100,000; see the explanation for answer B.
Answer to Question 27.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. According to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 4, an implied-in-fact contract
is a contract where the mutual promises are inferred from conduct.
Answer A is incorrect. A promise in an implied-in-fact contract does not have to be evidenced by a signed writing.
Answer B is incorrect. Whether parties have entered into an agreement is determined by an objective standard and not by
the subjective intent of the parties.
Answer D is incorrect. As with any contract, an implied-in-fact contract requires mutual assent.
Answer to Question 28.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Although a request for waiver of service was sent, the defendant was not obligated to
and did not respond to the request. Without a waiver of formal service, the plaintiff must formally serve the defendant
before the defendant would have an obligation to respond. In the absence of formal service, an entry of default would be
inappropriate.
Answer B is incorrect. Per Rule 4(l), the failure to file proof of service does not affect the validity of service. The
problem here is that there has been no service of process and the defendant has not waived formal service.
Answer C is incorrect. Rule 4(d) encourages but does not require defendants to waive formal service by returning a
signed waiver request. Thus, a failure to return the waiver simply obliges the plaintiff to proceed with formal service; it


does not subject the defendant to the possibility of default.
Answer D is incorrect. Mailing notice of the complaint does not qualify as a permissible form of service under the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, no formal service of process has been effected in this case.
Answer to Question 29.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), holds that Congress does not have the
power under the Commerce Clause to regulate a noncommercial activity with no link to interstate commerce. Unlike in
Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), the facts here do not involve a comprehensive regulation of commerce that
incidentally covers some intrastate activities.
Answer A is incorrect. Congress can use its commerce power to regulate economic activity, such as manufacturing and
production of articles for interstate commerce, that is not itself a commercial transaction. In addition, Gonzales v. Raich
holds that Congress can incidentally regulate noncommercial activities in order to effectuate regulations of related
commercial activities.
Answer C is incorrect. While stoves and fuels may have previously moved in interstate commerce, they are not
themselves channels or instrumentalities of commerce.
Answer D is incorrect. United States v. Lopez holds that the aggregate effects test applies only to regulations of
economic activity.
Answer to Question 30.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Defense counsel should request an instruction on the lesser included offense of
involuntary manslaughter. On the facts described, a jury could potentially conclude that the woman did not act with the
sort of aggravated recklessness necessary to constitute depraved-heart homicide or extreme-indifference murder, even
though she was intoxicated and driving in an unlawful manner.
Answer A is incorrect because depraved-heart homicide is a form of murder. Accordingly, this instruction would not
constitute a lesser-offense instruction.
Answer C is incorrect. Voluntary intoxication is generally a theory of defense and not a crime in and of itself. Even if
understood as the offense of “public intoxication,” this offense would be a poor choice because public intoxication is not a
lesser included offense of murder.
Answer D is incorrect. The facts do not suggest that the woman intended to kill the pedestrian. Neither do they suggest
any sort of provocation.
Answer to Question 31.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The witness’s testimony is sufficient to authenticate the photograph under FRE 901.
It is testimony of a witness with knowledge that the photograph is what it is claimed to be.
Answer A is incorrect. The answer misstates the standard under FRE 403. For the photograph to be inadmissible under
that rule, the unfair prejudice from the photograph must substantially outweigh its probative value. In any event, here the
probative value of the photograph is considerable (it shows the plaintiff’s injury and supports the claim that the paint can
dropped by the defendant caused it), and the prejudicial effect (the potential to inflame or distract the jury) is low.


Answer B is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof that the photograph “is what the proponent claims it is.” The witness’s
proffered testimony satisfies that requirement: he will testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as he saw
it. Proof that cell-phone technology produces accurate photographs is unnecessary, given the witness’s testimony.
Answer D is incorrect. The photograph is not self-authenticating; it falls under none of the categories of self-
authenticating documents listed in FRE 902. A witness is required to authenticate it, in this case the witness who took the
photograph.
Answer to Question 32.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Conversion occurs when an actor intentionally interacts with an item that is the
personal property of another so as to permanently deprive the other of possession. This is true regardless of whether the
actor knows that the item is in another’s possession. Thus, the landowner’s reasonable belief that the trees were his does
not defeat liability for either the landowner or the tree specialist.
Answers B and C are both incorrect. The tree specialist’s action meets the definition of conversion regardless of the
fact that he was directed to take that action by the landowner.
Answer D is incorrect. Because the tree specialist was hired by the landowner and cut down the trees at the direction of
the landowner, the landowner (along with the tree specialist) is subject to liability for conversion.
Answer to Question 33.
Explanation: Answer B is correct because the woman conveyed a springing executory interest to the nephew while
retaining a fee simple subject to executory limitation. The woman’s death did not affect the nephew’s springing executory
interest, and her estate now holds the fee simple subject to executory limitation. When and if the nephew marries, his
executory interest will vest in fee simple. If the nephew dies unmarried, the sister’s interest will swell into a fee simple.
Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the nephew recorded the deed provided constructive notice to the world of his
interest but did not affect his interest. The nephew received a springing executory interest and the woman held a fee
simple subject to executory limitation.
Answer C is incorrect. The nephew received a future interest that will vest when he marries. The woman’s death did not
invalidate the nephew’s springing executory interest.
Answer D is incorrect. The nephew received a springing executory interest. The warranty deed did not require the
nephew to marry before the death of the woman.
Answer to Question 34.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The requirements for forfeiting a hearsay objection and a confrontation objection are
the same, and the prosecutor has not demonstrated forfeiture of either objection. In order to forfeit either a hearsay
objection under FRE 804(b)(6) or a confrontation clause objection, a defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct
for the purpose of preventing the declarant from testifying. Here, the defendant’s purpose for his wrongful conduct
(killing the declarant) was revenge for a theft and not a desire to prevent trial testimony. Therefore, the prosecutor cannot
make the showing of intent required for forfeiture of either objection.
Answers A and B are incorrect for the reasons set out above.


Answer D is incorrect. The federal courts have held that a trial judge may find the threshold requirements for forfeiture
by a preponderance of the evidence. Further, the preponderance standard applies to the trial judge’s determinations on
preliminary questions of admissibility under FRE 104(a).
Answer to Question 35.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Transfers to a different federal court are granted in the interest of justice and for the
convenience of the parties and witnesses. Here, because the accident occurred in State B, because the railroad is located in
State B, and because other passengers have brought actions in State B federal court, State B appears to be the most
convenient venue for the action.
Answer B is incorrect. Whether an action shares common questions of fact with similar actions pending in another state
is not a driving component of a change-of-venue analysis. Rather, what matters most is the convenience of the parties and
witnesses and the “interests of justice.”
Answer C is incorrect. Although the railroad’s being located in State B is an aspect of what would make State B a
convenient forum for this action, it is not determinative and would not on its own be a basis for rejecting the forum
selected by the passenger.
Answer D is incorrect. Venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the
claim occurred. Thus, venue could be proper in the State A federal court, depending on facts not set out in the question,
such as where the railroad maintained or housed the train. But even if venue were not proper in State A, the appropriate
remedy for the railroad in that case would be dismissal. To support a transfer to a State B federal court, the railroad will
still need to argue that a State B federal court would be convenient for the parties and the witnesses.
Answer to Question 36.
Answer D is correct. Upon request, a court should give a lesser included offense instruction if, on the evidence presented,
the jury could rationally acquit the defendant of the charged offense but convict of the lesser offense. Here, the element of
value is in reasonable dispute.
Answer A is incorrect. A court can instruct the jury on lesser included offenses, and it should do so, whenever the
evidence creates a rational basis for acquitting of the greater offense and convicting of the lesser offense.
Answer B is incorrect for two reasons. First, the value of the property taken is clearly an element in the statute described
here; it is the crucial element that distinguishes aggravated theft from simple theft. Second, under the Apprendi rule, an
element that changes the authorized statutory maximum for an offense must be determined by the fact-finder at trial.
Answer C is incorrect. It is not true that the court must always instruct the jury on all lesser included offenses. The court
should refrain from instructing on a lesser included offense if the evidence does not create a rational basis for acquitting of
the greater offense and convicting of the lesser offense.
Answer to Question 37.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Congress cannot play any role in the removal of executive officers, as the Supreme
Court made clear in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), and Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986).
Answer A is incorrect. A series of Supreme Court cases beginning with Myers sharply limits Congress’s ability to
impose conditions on the removal of federal officials.


Answer B is incorrect. Myers and subsequent cases make it clear that the Senate has no role in the removal of federal
officers other than via impeachment.
Answer D is incorrect because it is an overbroad statement of the law. The Supreme Court has upheld the power of
Congress to remove certain types of federal officials, such as those serving as members of the governing bodies of
regulatory agencies and inferior officers in agencies where the head of the agency is removable by the President at will.
Answer to Question 38.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. When the written contract fails to express the actual agreement because of a mistake
of both parties, the court may reform the writing to accurately express the agreement.
Answer A is incorrect. When a written contract fails to express the actual agreement of the parties, the remedy is
reformation of the contract, not avoidance.
Answer B is incorrect. The parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence to prove that an agreed-upon
term was mistakenly omitted from the writing.
Answer D is incorrect. This is not a case of interpreting a written contract but rather one of reforming a writing to
express the parties’ true intentions.
Answer to Question 39.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Where a deed is delivered to secure a loan to buy land, the deed is treated as a
mortgage if doing so accomplishes the parties’ intent. Here the facts clearly establish the parties’ intent that the friend
merely have a security interest in the land, not an absolute title.
Answer A is incorrect. As a matter of law there is no such presumption.
Answer B is incorrect. The merger doctrine relates to contractual promises relating to the quality of transferred title.
Here the promises relate to whether the terms of the conveyance were intended to transfer any title or merely create a lien
on the land.
Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the woman lived on the land is irrelevant to the characterization of the transaction
as an equitable mortgage.
Answer to Question 40.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The defense attorney should have immediately objected when the witness related
inadmissible hearsay. An objection raised only after the witness has left the stand is not timely under FRE 103. In
addition, the delayed objection failed to preserve the right to appeal, because the defense attorney did not state a specific
basis for the objection under FRE 103.
Answer A is incorrect. Sometimes a witness relates inadmissible information before opposing counsel has had an
opportunity to identify the inadmissible nature of the information and object. An objection accompanied by a motion to
strike at the first opportunity—even after the inadmissible information has been presented to the jury—may be timely
pursuant to FRE 103.
Answer C is incorrect. A hearsay statement to the witness by a friend is not “testimonial” for purposes of the Sixth
Amendment. In addition, counsel must timely raise a confrontation objection at trial in order to preserve the objection for


appeal, which the defense attorney did not do in this case.
Answer D is incorrect. An objection must be made at the earliest opportunity under FRE 103, and an objection that is
made “during trial” but not while the witness is still on the stand is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.
Answer to Question 41.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Given the rule provided in the question, because the man was 25% responsible, he
cannot recover from any defendant, as each was also 25% responsible (a percentage equal to the man’s responsibility).
Answers A, B, and C are incorrect for the same reason.
Answer to Question 42.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d) requires that every order granting a TRO must
state the reasons why it was issued and must detail the acts restrained, which this order failed to do.
Answer B is incorrect. A TRO may be issued without notifying the party to be enjoined if the moving party submits an
affidavit certifying the reasonable efforts made to give notice. Because the US Attorney submitted that certification along
with the motion, no notice was required.
Answer C is incorrect. The fact that damages would be inadequate to address the indicated harm would be a reason to
grant the TRO. However, in this instance the TRO is improper because the court failed to state the reasons why it was
issued and failed to detail the acts restrained.
Answer D is incorrect. The fact that imminent irreparable harm is threatened would be a reason to grant the TRO.
However, in this instance the TRO is improper because the court failed to state the reasons why it was issued and failed to
detail the acts restrained.
Answer to Question 43.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The Take Care Clause requires the President to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed, and one of those laws is the requirement that all the funds in question be spent on planting flowers. Keeping the
funds in the federal treasury violates the legal mandate that all the funds be spent. The President cannot use the money to
train troops, because the Appropriations Clause of Article I provides that federal spending must be authorized by
Congress.
Answer A is incorrect for the reasons stated in the explanation for answer D.
Answer B is incorrect because spending the money to train federal troops violates the Appropriations Clause.
Answer C is incorrect because retaining the funds in the treasury violates the federal mandate to spend all appropriated
funds.
Answer to Question 44.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The stockholder is a lay witness seeking to give testimony on causation that requires
the specialized knowledge of an expert witness. Under FRE 701, the stockholder’s testimony is inadmissible.


Answer B is incorrect. If otherwise qualified, an expert witness can have a personal interest in the outcome of the action
and still testify. The expert’s personal interest can be explored on cross-examination. In this case, however, the
stockholder is not qualified as an expert.
Answer C is incorrect. An admissible opinion about the cause of the price drop cannot be based on the stockholder’s
perception; it requires an expertise that he does not possess. His opinion testimony will not be helpful to the jury because
the stockholder is not qualified to speak to the causation issue.
Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 701, property owners are entitled to express opinions on the value of their property,
but here the stockholder is expressing an opinion on the cause of the publicly traded stock’s price drop. Such testimony
requires a witness with specialized knowledge about the stock market.
Answer to Question 45.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The man committed criminal solicitation by attempting to cause the officer to
commit the crime of possessing a controlled substance.
Answer A is incorrect. The man is not guilty of conspiracy because the facts do not show an agreement between the
participants.
Answer B is incorrect. The man is not guilty of attempt because the facts do not show that he was in dangerously close
proximity to a completed offense. Most pertinently, the man did not have drugs in his possession.
Answer D is incorrect because the facts show that the man committed a criminal solicitation.
Answer to Question 46.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. When an offer can be accepted either by promise or by performance, the beginning of
performance acts as an acceptance that completes the process of mutual assent and binds both parties since consideration
also is present.
Answer A is incorrect. When an offer can be accepted by performance, notice of beginning performance is not required
unless that requirement is included in the offer by the offeror.
Answer B is incorrect. An offer generally can be revoked prior to acceptance. But here the attorney accepted the offer by
beginning performance before the client’s attempted revocation.
Answer D is incorrect. The offer was revocable only before acceptance, and the attorney accepted it when she began
performance.
Answer to Question 47.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. This answer accurately states the relevant legal rule.
Answer A is incorrect. The problem is not the amount of damages but rather the lack of evidence demonstrating that the
radiologist injured the patient in a willful or wanton manner, which is required for the award of any punitive damages.
Answer B is incorrect. Punitive damages are allowed to be awarded when there is a showing that the defendant willfully
or wantonly injured the plaintiff, and such damages are not based on the extent of the plaintiff’s injuries.


Answer D is incorrect. The patient’s own negligence is irrelevant to the question of whether punitive damages are
appropriate.
Answer to Question 48.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Because there are no other liens against the property, the bank’s acceptance of the
deed in lieu of foreclosure gives the bank a free and clear title to the property.
Answer A is incorrect. The point of offering the deed to the bank is to get the woman out from under a liability to the
bank. The woman does not wish to redeem the property.
Answer B is incorrect. Deeds in lieu of foreclosure can be used for both commercial and residential properties.
Answer D is incorrect. A short sale occurs when the lender (the bank) agrees to release its lien in exchange for the sale
proceeds. Here, the woman wants to deed the house back to the bank and not sell it to another party.
Answer to Question 49.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Courts may deny leave to amend when the claim to be added is futile. Here, the claim
is futile on limitations grounds unless relation back applies. Relation back does not apply here because the worker’s
failure to name the competitor in the original complaint was not due to a mistake of identity, which is the standard that
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 imposes to permit relation back of amendments adding a party.
Answer A is incorrect. The closing of discovery does not foreclose amending a complaint to add a new party. And
whether the competitor will be prejudiced by being made a party at this stage of the case is relevant to whether to allow
the amendment, but it is not dispositive.
Answer C is incorrect. Although leave to amend should be freely granted, the claim here is futile because it is brought
after the applicable limitations period has expired and does not relate back.
Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the allegations against the competitor arise out of the same factual circumstances
outlined in the original complaint is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the new claim to relate back when it is
asserted against a new party. Additionally, for Rule 15 to permit relation back, the failure to name a party in the original
complaint must have been due to a mistake of identity, which was not the case here.
Answer to Question 50.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The man committed solicitation of murder by attempting to induce the undercover
officer to murder the man’s ex-wife.
Answer A is incorrect because the facts do not show that the man took sufficient steps toward completing a murder. The
man did nothing but offer to pay, and this conduct is not “dangerously proximate” to the commission of the offense as
required by the common law.
Answer B is incorrect because the facts do not show the existence of a bilateral conspiracy. The man’s offer, given the
undercover officer’s insincere agreement, established only a unilateral conspiracy.
Answer D is incorrect. The question calls for the most serious crime of which the man can be convicted, and solicitation
of murder is more serious than misprision of a felony. Additionally, the facts do not establish a misprision. That offense


occurs when a person fails to inform the authorities about a felony that the person knows about.
Answer to Question 51.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. A person cannot avoid a contract for mistake where that person bears the risk of
mistake. Here, the heir bore the risk because she was aware that she had only limited knowledge with respect to the facts
but treated her limited knowledge as sufficient.
Answer B is incorrect. The neighbor may have also been mistaken as to the value of the painting, but it was the heir who
bore the risk of mistake, as she treated her limited knowledge as sufficient.
Answer C is incorrect. Where a mistake is mutual, the loss falls on the party who bore the risk of mistake.
Answer D is incorrect. Although it is true that the parties were mutually mistaken, it was the heir who bore the risk of
mistake.
Answer to Question 52.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The buyer intentionally shoved the employee, which satisfies the prima facie case for
battery. As an affirmative defense, the buyer could claim that she was privileged to use force against the employee in
order to maintain possession of her laptop. However, this defense will be established only if the jury reasonably concludes
that the buyer’s use of force was reasonable under the circumstances (rather than excessive). Thus, the trial court should
deny the buyer’s motion for summary judgment.
Answer B is incorrect. The buyer’s claim of privilege for the use of force would be based on her possessory right in the
laptop, not the car.
Answer C is incorrect. This answer suggests that there is a general rule permitting possessors to use nonlethal force to
protect their possessory rights in all situations. This is not the case: possessors can sometimes use nonlethal force to
protect their possessions, but only if the force used is reasonable under the circumstances.
Answer D is incorrect. The buyer’s compliance with the employee’s request for the keys, and the reasonableness of the
buyer’s request to retrieve the laptop, do not establish as a matter of law that the buyer’s use of force was reasonable
under the circumstances.
Answer to Question 53.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The woman’s statement is hearsay if offered to prove its truth—that the defendant
sold cocaine. There is no hearsay exception that would apply to admit her statement against the defendant.
Answer B is incorrect. The prosecutor’s failure to establish the woman’s unavailability is not the reason that her
statement is inadmissible. Because there is no hearsay exception that would make the woman’s statement admissible to
prove its truth, it would be inadmissible even if the prosecutor were to properly establish her unavailability.
Answer C is incorrect. The woman’s statement was made to a police officer following her arrest and not during a drug
conspiracy with the defendant. The statement also certainly did nothing to further a drug conspiracy, even if one did exist.
Answer D is incorrect. The portion of the woman’s statement attributing fault to the defendant and suggesting that he
was her drug supplier was not against the woman’s penal interest. Indeed, once she was apprehended, her statement


shifted blame to the defendant and away from herself and was in fact self-serving.
Answer to Question 54.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The initial contract did not require time to be “of the essence” for the closing. When
the buyer requested a postponement of 15 days, the seller agreed but noted that time was now “of the essence,” which the
buyer agreed was reasonable. Time may be made of the essence later if there is a reasonable time between the notice and
the new date.
Answer A is incorrect. A buyer can request a change in the closing date. If the seller had not agreed, the buyer could
close within a reasonable time of the initial closing date because time had not yet been made of the essence.
Answer C is incorrect. Time had been made “of the essence” when the closing date was changed. It is irrelevant why the
buyer did not appear at the rescheduled closing.
Answer D is incorrect. Though the original contract did not mention time being “of the essence,” time can be made “of
the essence” in a later document provided that there is a reasonable time between the date of the notice that time is now
“of the essence” and the rescheduled closing date.
Answer to Question 55.
Answer C is correct. The commission exercises significant legal authority. For that reason, the commissioners are
officers of the United States. Because they are not under any other federal agency, they are not considered inferior officers
and must therefore be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. U.S. Const., Art. II, Sec. 2;
Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651 (1997); Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868 (1991).
Answer A is incorrect. Judges can appoint some inferior officers, but not principal officers such as these commissioners.
Answer B is incorrect. Executive officers cannot be appointed by Congress.
Answer D is incorrect because answer C states the correct method of appointment.
Answer to Question 56.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Because the defendant did not object to any of the instructions, Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 51(d)(2) provides that the defendant’s appeal can only be successful if the instruction affected the defendant’s
substantial rights, which is the standard for plain error.
Answer B is incorrect. There is no obligation to seek a new trial before challenging jury instructions on appeal, so long
as the applicable plain error standard can be satisfied. Plain error is the standard because the defendant failed to object at
trial.
Answer C is incorrect. Plain error, not abuse of discretion, is the standard for reviewing instructions that the parties did
not object to, as was the case here.
Answer D is incorrect. The errors were not waived by the failure to object. Rather, the failure to object waived full
review, with the result that the standard for assigning error was raised to plain error.
Answer to Question 57.


Explanation: Answer A is correct. Although the friend was not informed of the women’s plan, he would reasonably
have become aware of the robbery when they emerged running from the bank, bags in hand, with alarms sounding. The
friend’s subsequent act—driving the women away from the bank to their apartment—would support a guilty verdict on
the crime of accessory after the fact.
Answer B is incorrect because the friend did not know about the planned robbery and thus did not act with the intent to
facilitate that offense, as required for accomplice liability.
Answer C is incorrect because the friend did not know about the planned robbery and thus did not agree with intent to
commit the offense, as required for conspiracy.
Answer D is incorrect. Although the friend was innocent until the women emerged from the bank, his subsequent
culpable act to aid his friends after the robbery makes him criminally liable as an accessory after the fact.
Answer to Question 58.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The engineer’s obligation was to “use best efforts to obtain county approval,” not to
obtain county approval, and the engineer performed all obligations as promised. Therefore, the developer breached by
refusing to perform the developer’s obligations under the contract. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 225, 235.
Answer A is incorrect. There is no express condition. Under the rule of constructive conditions of exchange, the
performance by one party is an implied condition to performance by the other party. Since the engineer performed all
obligations, the developer breached by refusing to perform the developer’s contractual obligation to pay the engineer.
Answer B is incorrect. The engineer did not breach the contract, because the engineer had an obligation to “use best
efforts to obtain county approval,” not to obtain county approval.
Answer D is incorrect. There is no express condition. The engineer had an obligation to “use best efforts to obtain county
approval” and performed that obligation.
Answer to Question 59.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The production of evidence “sufficient to support a finding” that the evidence is what
the proponent (here the prosecution) claims it to be is the proper standard for authentication under FRE 901.
Answer A is incorrect. To authenticate the items under FRE 901, the prosecution must produce evidence “sufficient to
support a finding” that the items were found in the apartment. A finding by the court that the prosecution has made a clear
and convincing showing that the items are what the prosecution claims them to be is not required. That is too high a
standard and would result in keeping relevant evidence from the jury.
Answer B is incorrect. Proof of chain of custody—what happened to the evidence after it was initially seized from the
apartment—is one way of authenticating evidence, but it is not necessary here, since the prosecution has called a witness
who will testify that he saw each of the items in the apartment.
Answer D is incorrect. FRE 901 requires proof sufficient to support a finding that the items are what the prosecution
claims them to be. Requiring a court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the items are what the prosecution
claims them to be would result in keeping relevant evidence from the jury; it is too high a standard.
Answer to Question 60.


Explanation: Answer D is correct. A state tax is valid if it is nondiscriminatory and does not apply directly to the federal
government. United States v. California, 507 U.S. 746 (1993).
Answer A is incorrect. A state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government, but the tax in this situation was
imposed on the contractor.
Answer B is incorrect. The economic incidence of the tax is not constitutionally relevant.
Answer C is incorrect. It misstates the constitutional test given in answer D.
Answer to Question 61.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The 10-year statute of limitations began to run 17 years ago when the city began
using the land for non-park purposes, a use it continued for more than the statutory 10-year period. The woman failed to
sue the city in a timely manner after the city stopped using the land for a park. Thus, when the woman died, she no longer
owned the land and no interest passed to her son.
Answer B is incorrect. The changing needs of the city did not make the city’s actions permissible; the woman could have
filed a timely claim that the city had violated the terms of the deed.
Answer C is incorrect. Lapse occurs when a recipient under a will dies before the testator. That is not what occurred
here.
Answer D is incorrect. When the woman conveyed the land to the city, she retained a possibility of reverter, which
became possessory when the city ceased to use the land for a park. At that time, the woman had a cause of action against
the city, which she failed to bring in a timely manner.
Answer to Question 62.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The question of the passenger’s negligence is relevant to the jury’s assessment of
damages but is not a bar to a res ipsa instruction.
Answer A is incorrect. The company was exclusively in control of the elevator and the injury would not have happened
if the elevator had not malfunctioned, so the passenger’s request for a res ipsa instruction should be granted.
Answer B is incorrect. The passenger’s negligence is relevant to the damages awarded, if any, but it is not a bar to a res
ipsa instruction.
Answer D is incorrect. The question of the passenger’s negligence is not relevant to whether a res ipsa instruction is
appropriate but rather to the amount of damages to assess if the company is found liable.
Answer to Question 63.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Because the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense
to this kind of claim, instructing the jury on contributory negligence and allowing that instruction to stand will affect the
consumer’s substantive rights by permitting the consumer to lose the case based on an erroneous statement of the law. The
inclusion of the instruction thus constitutes plain error.
Answer A is incorrect. The attorney’s failure to object before the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction is


not an obstacle to the judge’s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the
error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim.
Answer B is incorrect. The attorney’s failure to object at the time the judge gave the contributory negligence instruction
is not an obstacle to the judge’s considering the objection, if the error referenced in the objection is plain error. Here, the
error is plain, since the governing law does not recognize contributory negligence as a defense to this kind of claim.
Answer D is incorrect. For most objections to jury instructions, the objection must be made before the instruction is
given to the jury. There is no 28-day window after the jury is instructed to object to any instructions. The exception to the
general rule of making all objections before the jury is instructed is for objections of plain error, which is the case here.
Answer to Question 64.
Answer B is correct. On these facts, the officers could reasonably believe that a warrantless entry was necessary to keep
the man from harming himself or others. When the officers entered, they did not know whether another person was in the
home, nor did they know whose blood was on the shirt. Consequently, under Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U.S. 45 (2009), the
warrantless entry was reasonable.
Answer A is incorrect. Although the emergency aid exception may justify a warrantless entry, the exception does not
alter a person’s standing to assert a Fourth Amendment claim. In other words, the exception does not abridge a person’s
reasonable expectation of privacy.
Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, the emergency aid exception can justify a warrantless entry when the
suspect is the only person who needs aid. Second, as noted, on these facts the officers could reasonably believe that the
suspect may not have been the only person who needed aid.
Answer D is incorrect because the emergency aid exception can justify a warrantless entry regardless of whether the
homeowner requests a warrant.
Answer to Question 65.
Answer C is correct. Even a nondiscriminatory state law may be unconstitutional if the burden on interstate commerce
clearly outweighs the state’s interest in regulation. However, in this case the state law does not discriminate against
interstate commerce and the burden is minimal compared with the state’s interest in applying its police, welfare, and
safety regulations. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co. v. Wood, 344 U.S. 157 (1952).
Answer A is incorrect because a nondiscriminatory state law is not subject to the requirement of being necessary to
achieve the state’s interest. The only requirement is that such a law not be a clearly excessive burden on interstate
commerce.
Answer B is incorrect because there is minimal burden on carriers and no discrimination against interstate commerce.
Answer D is incorrect because it states the “compelling interest” test that applies only to claims that state laws violate
individual rights such as freedom of speech.
Answer to Question 66.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Here the offeror (the subcontractor) knew that the offeree (the firm) would
substantially rely on the offer in creating a bid for the municipality’s project and knew that the firm could not accept the
subcontractor’s offer until the municipality accepted the firm’s overall bid on the project. This reasonable reliance had the


effect of creating an option contract under which the subcontractor could not revoke its bid for a reasonable time. Since
the subcontractor could not revoke its bid, its attempt at revocation was ineffective, and the bid was still open at the time
the firm accepted it. Therefore, a contract was formed by offer and acceptance, and the remedy for breach of this contract
is expectation damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 87(2) & cmt. e; Drennan v. Star Paving, 333 P.2d 757
(1958).
Answer A is incorrect. A contract was formed when the firm timely accepted the subcontractor’s offer. Therefore, the
firm is entitled to recover expectation damages measured by the difference between the amount paid to the second
subcontractor and the amount of the first subcontractor’s bid.
Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the firm’s reliance kept the subcontractor’s bid open as an option contract.
Once the offer was accepted, a contract was formed, and expectation damages would be the most appropriate measure of
recovery for breach.
Answer D is incorrect. While an offeror generally has the power to revoke an offer up until the moment of acceptance,
detrimental reliance by the offeree can make an offer irrevocable by transforming it into an option contract, which is what
happened here with the subcontractor’s bid.
Answer to Question 67.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. A person may validly mortgage their land to secure the debt of another person. The
mortgagor need not be the debtor.
Answer B is incorrect. The mother is not personally liable on the debt because she neither signed the note secured by the
mortgage nor at any time agreed to assume payment of the mortgage.
Answer C is incorrect. A person can mortgage their property even though the person did not become liable on a debt by
signing the promissory note.
Answer D is incorrect. The bank’s mortgage is enforceable because the mother signed the mortgage.
Answer to Question 68.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The defense may offer extrinsic evidence of a witness’s prior inconsistent statement
for the limited non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the witness after the witness has been given an opportunity to explain
or deny the statement.
Answer A is incorrect. The witness’s statement to the investigator may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of
impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement.
Answer B is incorrect. An opposing party must give a witness an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent
statement under FRE 613(b). But, if the witness has had that opportunity, the opposing party may offer extrinsic evidence
of the statement. It is precisely in situations where the witness denies having made the inconsistent statement that extrinsic
evidence that it was made would be most useful.
Answer C is incorrect. The statement would have to be admitted for its truth in order to prove that the plaintiff did not
fall, but because the statement was made out of court to an investigator, it is hearsay for that purpose. And since there is
no applicable hearsay exception for the witness’s statement to the investigator, it cannot be admitted to prove that the
plaintiff did not fall.


Answer to Question 69.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Whether the friend’s conduct amounts to an implied assumption of risk, thus
defeating liability entirely, or comparative fault, thus potentially allowing for partial recovery, is a jury question.
Answers A and C are incorrect for the same reason.
Answer D is incorrect. A jury could reasonably find the friend less at fault than the manager.
Answer to Question 70.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to obtain a voluntary
dismissal by filing a motion with the court, and a dismissal order under Rule 41(a)(2) is presumptively without prejudice,
consistent with the woman’s goal of refiling the action at a later date.
Answer B is incorrect. Rule 41(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action by filing a notice of dismissal,
without having to seek permission from the court. However, that pathway is only available until the defendant answers (or
moves for summary judgment). Because the defendants have both answered, it is too late to dismiss the action simply by
giving notice.
Answer C is incorrect. To dismiss an action voluntarily on stipulation requires the assent of all parties who have
appeared in the action. Thus, a stipulation signed only by the doctor would be insufficient to effect dismissal, since the
doctor and the hospital have both answered the complaint.
Answer D is incorrect. Submitting such an affidavit would be a proper response to achieve a delay of the court’s
consideration of the summary judgment motion in order to allow the woman further discovery. However, the woman’s
goal is to dismiss and refile the action. Submitting the described affidavit would not achieve that goal.
Answer to Question 71.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The fact that the company supplies a very important good to the public is not
sufficient to make it a state actor, nor is the non-exclusive franchise from the city. Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co.,
419 U.S. 345 (1974).
Answer B is incorrect. The facts do not indicate that the resident was actually in arrears. The purpose of the due process
hearing would be to determine whether the resident was in arrears.
Answer C is incorrect. Private entities performing a public function are state actors only if the function is an exclusively
governmental service or one that involves inherently governmental powers such as incarceration. Supplying water does
not satisfy either of these requirements.
Answer D is incorrect. Receipt of a public franchise is not enough to make a company a state actor.
Answer to Question 72.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Nondisclosure of a fact is the equivalent of a misrepresentation when a person knows
that disclosure of the fact is necessary to prevent some previous assertion from being a misrepresentation.
Answer A is incorrect. The lender had no duty to make an independent assessment when reliance on the representation
was reasonable.


Answer B is incorrect. While it is true that the man did not make an affirmative misrepresentation, failure to disclose is
the equivalent of an assertion under these facts.
Answer C is incorrect. Concealment requires an affirmative act; here the man failed to disclose the change in
circumstances rather than affirmatively acting to conceal it.
Answer to Question 73.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Disclosure to the grand jury of the client’s identity would not reveal anything about
the communications between the client and the lawyer; the attorney-client privilege therefore does not apply, and the
lawyer can be compelled to make the disclosure.
Answer A is incorrect because the identity of a lawyer’s client is generally not protected by the attorney-client privilege;
disclosure of the client’s identity alone would not reveal any confidential attorney-client communications.
Answer B is incorrect. The privilege against self-incrimination prevents the client from being compelled to give
testimony harmful to themself. It does not prevent the lawyer from disclosing the client’s identity.
Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 1101(c), rules on privilege apply to all stages of a case, including grand jury
proceedings.
Answer to Question 74.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The man can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery because he and his friend
agreed to commit that offense.
Answer A is incorrect because the man did not agree to commit an armed robbery. The facts show that the man was
unaware of the friend’s gun.
Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers A and B. The man can be convicted of
conspiracy to commit robbery but not conspiracy to commit armed robbery.
Answer D is incorrect because, as noted, the man did conspire to commit a robbery. It does not matter that the robbery
was unsuccessful; a conspiracy is complete when the agreement has been reached.
Answer to Question 75.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The man granted an express easement appurtenant to the woman “and her heirs and
assigns.” The man’s land was the servient estate, the woman’s land was the dominant estate, and the easement benefits the
woman’s land. An easement appurtenant passes with the title, and now the buyer has the benefit of the easement. It is
irrelevant that the buyer had no actual notice of the easement when she bought the land.
Answer B is incorrect. The fact that the man received $10,000 is irrelevant. The man granted the woman an easement
appurtenant, which runs with the dominant estate. An easement appurtenant may be granted by purchase or by gift.
Answer C is incorrect. The buyer did purchase the land without any type of notice, but this is not a reason for the man to
prevail. The easement is for the benefit of whoever owns the land. The buyer can still assert her right to the easement
appurtenant because the easement has not terminated.


Answer D is incorrect. The easement was granted to the woman as the owner of the land across the street, which is the
dominant estate. The easement was not granted to the woman in her personal capacity. It was an easement appurtenant
and not in gross.
Answer to Question 76.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. A person is privileged to use reasonable force to protect another against imminent
harm, including self-inflicted harm. Given that the intoxicated man appears to have been on the verge of harming or
killing himself, it was reasonable for the bystander to push the man and lock him in the bedroom until the danger had
passed.
Answer A is incorrect. Even though the intentional pushing of another person without that person’s consent meets the
definition of a battery, the privilege to use force (referenced above) would defeat any battery claim brought by the man.
Answer B is incorrect. Even though the intentional confinement of another person without that person’s consent meets
the definition of false imprisonment, the privilege to use force (referenced above) would defeat this claim.
Answer C is incorrect for the reasons stated in the explanations for answers A and B.
Answer to Question 77.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48 permits a non-unanimous verdict if the parties so
stipulate, which happened here.
Answers B and C are incorrect. There is no requirement that a jury verdict be agreed to by at least six jurors.
Answer D is incorrect for the reason set out in the explanation for answer A.
Answer to Question 78.
Answer A is correct. Extrinsic evidence may be admitted to impeach a witness’s ability to perceive the events that
transpired. Both the loud music and the witness’s alcohol consumption at the time of the incident would undermine the
eyewitness’s ability to perceive.
Answer B is incorrect. The eyewitness’s consumption of large amounts of alcohol just before she observed the incident
in question would undermine her ability to perceive, and therefore evidence about that consumption would constitute
proper impeachment. Courts are cautious about allowing a witness’s general alcohol use or alcoholism to be used to
impeach when it is not connected directly to the time of the witness’s observation.
Answer C is incorrect. The eyewitness reported that she heard a gunshot, and very loud music in a crowded nightclub
could affect a person’s ability to perceive such a sound. Therefore, the testimony about the music would be proper
impeachment evidence.
Answer D is incorrect. Extrinsic evidence may be admitted to impeach a witness’s ability to perceive, though under FRE
608(b) such evidence is not admissible to prove a witness’s prior acts of dishonesty. Because this evidence relates to the
eyewitness’s ability to perceive accurately and not to any prior acts of dishonesty, both items of extrinsic evidence should
be admitted.
Answer to Question 79.


Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state licensing requirement should receive rational basis scrutiny because it
neither burdens a fundamental individual right nor creates a constitutionally suspect classification. The licensing
requirement for tutors is a rational means of protecting the state’s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors,
and so the state law easily satisfies the rational basis test.
Answer B is incorrect. Although answer B states correctly that the challenge to the licensing requirement will fail, it
provides the wrong standard of judicial review. The standard of review described in answer B is associated with the more
demanding intermediate judicial scrutiny, which does not apply here because the licensing requirement neither burdens a
specially protected individual right nor creates a constitutionally sensitive classification.
Answer C is incorrect. Although the licensing requirement serves the special interests of licensed tutors, it is at least
rational to believe that it also serves the state’s legitimate interest in ensuring the competency of tutors, which is all that is
required to sustain the statute.
Answer D is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which prohibits certain forms of
discrimination by states against the citizens of other states, is not implicated on these facts. Although the challenge is by
an out-of-state company, the state licensing requirement applies equally to the state’s citizens and to the citizens of other
states.
Answer to Question 80.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. On these facts, a jury could rationally find both that the woman was guilty of reckless
driving and that her illegal conduct caused the truck driver’s death. The woman’s conduct constitutes involuntary
manslaughter under a theory of “misdemeanor-manslaughter.”
Answer A is incorrect. The woman could be guilty of murder on a theory of malice aforethought only if she intended to
kill the driver. But the facts do not remotely suggest that the woman had that intent. The facts also do not support any
theory of imputed malice, such as felony murder or depraved indifference.
Answer B is incorrect because the woman did not intend to kill the driver and thus cannot be guilty of voluntary
manslaughter.
Answer D is incorrect because a jury could rationally convict the woman of involuntary manslaughter.
Answer to Question 81.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Anticipatory repudiation requires (1) an overt communication of an intention not to
perform a contractual obligation or (2) an action that renders performance impossible or shows a party’s determination not
to perform. UCC § 2-610, cmt. 1. Here the buyer did not anticipatorily repudiate because on March 3, he merely said that
he “might not” have the money to complete the transaction on March 6. Therefore, the owner anticipatorily repudiated by
selling the car to the neighbor and will not succeed in a claim against the buyer for breach of contract.
Answer A is incorrect. The duty of good faith did not require the seller to respond to the buyer in this situation.
Answer C is incorrect. As explained above, the buyer did not anticipatorily repudiate the contract.
Answer D is incorrect. An option contract would have made the seller’s offer irrevocable, but here the parties had
already formed an enforceable contract, and thus the revocability of an option offer became irrelevant.


Answer to Question 82.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The traditional assumption-of-risk defense is a complete defense, so if the jury finds
that the man knowingly and voluntarily chose to encounter the risk of falling down the darkened stairs, the owner will not
be liable.
Answer A is incorrect. The question states that the jurisdiction recognizes the traditional rule for assumption of risk,
which is a complete defense.
Answer C is incorrect. The man’s status as a licensee is not relevant to whether he assumed the risk of falling down the
stairs.
Answer D is incorrect. The question is not about what damages the man might recover but whether he assumed the risk
of falling down the stairs such that the owner would not be liable for his injuries.
Answer to Question 83.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The nephew and the niece inherited the vacant land as tenants in common. While
neither is personally liable on the mortgage, their failure to pay could result in a foreclosure. To avoid foreclosure,
payment must be made to the bank, and as co-tenants, each is responsible for his or her share of the mortgage payment.
The nephew paid more than his pro rata share and thus may recover the amount owed by the niece in a contribution
action.
Answer A is incorrect. The doctrine of exoneration applies when land that is subject to a mortgage is acquired at the time
of death and an attempt is made by the specific legatee to claim that the mortgage must be paid from general estate assets,
a scenario that does not exist here.
Answer C is incorrect. A partition action is not required before bringing an action for contribution for making mortgage
payments that, if not made, might have resulted in the foreclosure on the property by the bank.
Answer D is incorrect. Each tenant in common is required to make his or her pro rata share of payments such as
mortgage payments, which if not paid could result in foreclosure on the property. Consent is not required before making
the payments.
Answer to Question 84.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. In Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 498 (1941), the US Supreme Court
ruled that in cases governed by Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), the court is to apply whatever law would be
applied by the courts of the state in which the district court is sitting.
Answer B is incorrect. In Klaxon, the US Supreme Court ruled that in cases governed by Erie, the court is to apply
whatever law would be applied by the courts of the state in which the district court is sitting, not simply forum law.
Answer C is incorrect. Under Erie, the fact that the action is in federal court does not create a right to apply federal law,
and state substantive law governs.
Answer D is incorrect. While the constitutional limit preempts any state law that would extend that limit, the state-law
limit here is less than the constitutional limit and thus controls.


Answer to Question 85.
Answer B is correct. In Maryland v. King, 569 U.S. 435 (2013), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a state
law that authorized police to take DNA samples from persons arrested for serious offenses. King also affirmed the right of
law enforcement to test and store the DNA profiles in a government database and then compare them to unsolved crime
scene samples. Here, the defendant was arrested and charged with a felony, and the DNA sample was obtained, stored,
and used as authorized by statute. Thus there was no constitutional violation, and suppression is not justified.
Answer A is incorrect because there is no requirement that a person object at the time of a search or seizure in order to
retain the right to later lodge a Fourth Amendment challenge.
Answer C is incorrect because the statute does not violate the Fourth Amendment as explained above for answer B.
Answer D is incorrect because King specifically affirms the right to collect DNA from felony arrestees, as explained
above for answer B.
Answer to Question 86.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The witness would testify about the defendant’s out-of-court statement, and the
defense is offering that statement for the truth of the matter asserted: that the defendant wanted to pull out of the robbery.
There is no hearsay exception that applies to admit the statement.
Answer B is incorrect. There is no federal rule of evidence that automatically prohibits the admission of a criminal
defendant’s self-serving statement. If such a statement fit a hearsay exception (such as the excited utterance exception or
the state of mind exception), it could be admissible notwithstanding its self-serving nature.
Answer C is incorrect. The defendant’s statement does not satisfy the state of mind exception, which admits only
statements of a declarant’s own then-existing physical or mental state. It does not admit statements about past facts that
the declarant remembers or believes. Because the defendant’s statement describes past events (the robbery) and describes
a past state of mind (not one existing at the time he was speaking), the statement fails to satisfy the state of mind
exception.
Answer D is incorrect. Although the statement at issue is a “prior consistent” statement of the defendant, Federal Rule of
Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) does not admit all prior consistent statements for their truth. It admits only those that rehabilitate
the declarant-witness after an impeaching attack on the witness. Here there is no information about an impeaching attack
by the prosecution on the defendant that would justify admission of the earlier statement. Further, Rule 801(d)(1)(B)
admits only “pre-motive” statements when a witness has been impeached for recent fabrication. The defendant’s
statement, made after his arrest, would be post-motive and would not satisfy the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), even
if there had been an impeaching attack on the defendant’s credibility.
Answer to Question 87.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The state requirement of sterilization denies affected individuals the right to
procreate, which the US Supreme Court has held to be a fundamental right. A state law that burdens a fundamental right
must satisfy strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are correctly stated in Answer A.
Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which is not the proper standard.
Although laws that discriminate on the basis of sex receive intermediate scrutiny, a sex-neutral law like the sterilization
requirement would constitute sex discrimination only if the legislature had intended that the requirement benefit or harm
individuals because of their sex. There is no indication of such an intention on these facts. The disparate impact of the
sterilization requirement on men by itself is insufficient to demonstrate sex discrimination.


Answer C is incorrect. Answer C states the elements of strict judicial scrutiny, which is the proper standard. But the state
law receives that scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation, not because it is racially discriminatory.
A race-neutral law like the sterilization requirement would trigger strict scrutiny only if the legislature had intended that
the requirement benefit or harm individuals because of their race. There is no indication of such an intention on these
facts. The disparate impact of the sterilization requirement on members of a racial minority group by itself is insufficient
to demonstrate race discrimination.
Answer D is incorrect. It states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not applicable in this case. The state
sterilization requirement would receive strict judicial scrutiny because it burdens the fundamental right of procreation.
Answer to Question 88.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. If a written agreement fails to include a term of the agreement due to both parties’
mistake, the writing may be reformed to express the actual agreement. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 155. Here the
landlord is entitled to reformation to include the mistakenly omitted term.
Answer A is incorrect. A contract may not be formed if the terms are too indefinite, but here there was a mistakenly
omitted term, not an indefinite term.
Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, the landlord is entitled to reformation reflecting the agreed-upon discount for
the extra hours.
Answer D is incorrect. The parties did not share a mutual mistake—a belief that is not in accord with the facts. Rather,
both parties mistakenly believed that the writing reflected their actual agreement. In this situation, the writing may be
reformed to express the actual agreement.
Answer to Question 89.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. A seller is required to convey a marketable title to a buyer in the absence of a
contrary provision in the contract. A restrictive covenant makes title unmarketable unless the covenant is excepted in the
contract. Here there is no exception in the contract.
Answer B is incorrect. The law will require the title to be marketable but will not require a perfect title.
Answer C is incorrect. A restrictive covenant does render title unmarketable. A third party can prevent the buyer from
using the land as desired.
Answer D is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the seller did not know of the buyer’s plans to construct a gas station.
Answer to Question 90.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. A conclusion that the debt collector’s conduct was extreme and outrageous,
combined with the fact that the woman experienced severe emotional distress and the fact that the debt collector was
probably at least reckless with respect to the risk of causing her distress, will provide the woman with a plausible claim
for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). None of the conclusions stated in the other answers will provide as
much assistance to the woman in proving her IIED claim.
Answer A is incorrect. Even if the woman’s distress was reasonably foreseeable to the debt collector, that would not
suffice to establish the recklessness or intentionality necessary for IIED liability.


Answer B is incorrect. The woman’s subjective belief that the debt collector might someday attack her would not
establish that she suffered severe distress or that the debt collector’s conduct was extreme and outrageous.
Answer C is incorrect. A mere failure to comply with industry custom does not establish any of the elements of IIED.
Answer to Question 91.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. When a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure is valid and on point, it controls over a
conflicting state rule. Rule 8(c)(1) is on point because it specifically provides that contributory negligence is an
affirmative defense that a defending party must assert in its answer to the complaint. The rule is a valid exercise of the US
Supreme Court’s rulemaking power, because the manner of pleading defenses is an issue that can rationally be classified
as procedure and the rule itself regulates the manner and means by which the parties’ rights are enforced.
Answer A is incorrect. The question of who has the burden of pleading, in contrast to the burden of proof, in federal
actions is a procedural matter within the US Supreme Court’s rulemaking power.
Answer C is incorrect. The “outcome determinative” test applies only when asking whether a state rule that conflicts
with a judge-made federal practice should be followed. It does not apply when federal law comes from a valid and on-
point federal rule.
Answer D is incorrect. The “bound up” concept also applies only when asking whether a state rule that conflicts with a
judge-made federal practice should be followed.
Answer to Question 92.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel’s performance was
deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial. In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court held that defense
counsel has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether there are mitigating facts for the penalty
phase of a capital case. The Court held that defense counsel’s inadequate investigation was prejudicial because a
reasonable investigation would have revealed details that gave rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome in
sentencing; thus, the defendant had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Answer C is correct because, as
in Wiggins, defense counsel unreasonably chose not to investigate facts that could have been presented in mitigation, and
that failure was prejudicial.
Answer A is incorrect. Defense counsel’s decisions can be defended as strategic only when based on a reasonably
complete investigation. Although counsel does not have to pursue every conceivable line of inquiry, the investigation
must be reasonable under the circumstances. Here, counsel’s decision not to investigate was clearly unreasonable.
Answer B states a correct principle of law: Defense counsel must adhere to an objective standard of reasonableness. Here,
however, counsel’s failure to investigate was objectively unreasonable.
Answer D is incorrect because the Strickland standard does not require the presentation of all mitigating evidence, or of
any particular mitigating evidence. It rather requires counsel to engage in a reasonable investigation into mitigating
evidence, so that counsel can then employ a reasonable strategy in presenting such evidence.
Answer to Question 93.
Explanation: Answer B is correct because the state cannot impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its


agencies. United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720 (1982).
Answer A is incorrect. The tax on the lessee is rationally related to the collection of revenue and to imposing tax burdens
on the possessor of property.
Answer C is incorrect because the Social Security Administration is an agency of the federal government, regardless of
whether it has independence from the President.
Answer D is incorrect because even nondiscriminatory taxes imposed directly on the federal government are invalid.
Answer to Question 94.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Modification of a contract governed by common law requires mutual assent and
consideration. Here, the daughter did not agree to the modification and the father provided no consideration.
Answer B is incorrect. Even though the nephew was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the father and his
daughter, the nephew’s consent was not required for modification unless the contract provided otherwise. Here, however,
there was no modification of the contract, because the daughter did not agree to it.
Answer C is incorrect. The father retained no interest in the future proceeds of his daughter’s promise, and thus he could
not alter her obligation without her consent.
Answer D is incorrect. There was no effective modification, because the daughter did not agree to it. Furthermore, the
general common law rule is that a modification requires consideration, and here there was no consideration from the
father.
Answer to Question 95.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Even though the spectator might not obtain summary judgment on a claim of liability
for an abnormally dangerous activity, that claim—which imposes strict liability for injuries caused by an activity that is
not commonplace and that remains dangerous to bystanders even when the actor uses reasonable care to avoid causing
injuries—provides the spectator with the best chance of doing so.
Answer B is incorrect. The spectator was injured in an accident: the amusement park did not intend to touch the spectator
in a harmful or offensive manner, as is required for battery liability.
Answer C is incorrect. The spectator suffered personal injuries. The tort of nuisance imposes liability for unreasonable
interference with another person’s use or enjoyment of their property.
Answer D is incorrect. The doctrine of strict products liability applies only to commercial sellers of defective products
that cause injury, and there is nothing in the question to suggest that the amusement park—the only defendant in the
action—was in the business of selling fireworks.
Answer to Question 96.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The newspaper is self-authenticating under FRE 902(6), and the newspaper story is
not hearsay, because it is not offered for its truth but rather to show that the defendant was on notice of the plaintiff’s
bankruptcy.


Answer A is incorrect. A newspaper is a self-authenticating document under FRE 902(6) and thus does not require
separate authentication to be admitted into evidence.
Answer B is incorrect. The newspaper story is not hearsay because it is not being offered for its truth but rather to prove
that the defendant had notice of the plaintiff’s bankruptcy before he pursued the plaintiff for payment of the debts. See
FRE 801(c)(2).
Answer C is incorrect. Because the newspaper story is not offered for its truth, but rather to demonstrate notice of the
plaintiff’s bankruptcy, it is not hearsay, and no hearsay exception is required for its admission. Further, the past
recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule applies to testimony from a witness who made or adopted the recorded
recollection, which is not the case here.
Answer to Question 97.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The assignment of a note automatically transfers the mortgage to the assignee of the
note; a separate document assigning the mortgage to the assignee is unnecessary.
Answer A is incorrect. It is the opposite of answer C (the correct answer) and is contrary to the law.
Answer B is incorrect. A mortgage is not extinguished by a transfer of the note.
Answer D is incorrect. This question does not raise any issue of priorities concerning the land records. Transfers of a
mortgage are not required to be recorded to be valid in a dispute between the mortgagor and the holder of the note. The
investor is permitted to foreclose by virtue of being the assignee of the note.
Answer to Question 98.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The contract claim is a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 13(a), because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the investor’s
claim, and thus not only may the broker assert the contract claim, but that claim must be included in the broker’s answer
or it will be forfeited.
Answer A is incorrect. Nothing in the application of Rule 13 turns on whether the counterclaim is based on federal or
state law.
Answer B is incorrect. The lack of diversity is relevant to whether the court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, but it
is not relevant to whether Rule 13 permits the counterclaim to be asserted. In this case, despite the lack of diversity, the
court can hear the counterclaim, and in fact the broker must include it in the answer or forfeit it, because it is a
compulsory counterclaim. The court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim because it is related to
the investor’s securities law claim.
Answer D is incorrect. While Rule 13(b) permits parties to assert unrelated counterclaims as permissive counterclaims,
this is a compulsory counterclaim, as explained above, and thus it must be included in the broker’s answer or it will be
forfeited.
Answer to Question 99.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The question asks for the BEST argument against liability. Courts typically have held
that a defendant’s causing a property owner to view unsightly things from her property by itself does not suffice to
establish the sort of unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property that is necessary for nuisance


liability. While there is no guarantee that the farmer would prevail on the basis of this argument, it would be the farmer’s
best argument.
Answer A is incorrect. The harm the homeowner must prove in order to prevail on the nuisance claim is unreasonable
interference with her use and enjoyment of her property, not diminution in the market value of her property.
Answer B is incorrect. Items on one person’s land, if they cause an unreasonable interference with a neighboring
property owner’s use and enjoyment of their property, can constitute a nuisance. For example, if a person maintains a
trash heap in her backyard that sends nauseating odors to her neighbor’s yard, that person may be subject to liability for
nuisance even though the trash heap does not physically encroach on the neighbor’s property.
Answer C is incorrect. Determinations of nuisance often rest on judgments about the character of, and common practices
in, the relevant location. In this case, the fact that farmers in this area do not tend to keep old equipment on their land in
places visible to neighbors strengthens rather than weakens the homeowner’s claim that the farmer’s placement of the
unsightly items constitutes a nuisance.
Answer to Question 100.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. A deed to a deceased grantee is void.
Answer A is incorrect. Because the deed to the man is void, it is irrelevant that the deed was recorded. Recording does
not validate a void deed.
Answer B is incorrect. The man had no interest in the land and thus could not devise any interest in the land to his wife.
Answer C is incorrect. Because the deed is void, the woman’s stated intent to take back the gift is irrelevant, as there was
no gift to the man.
