At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue. These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from. On cross- examination, the company\u2019s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.

A former high-level employee of the cemetery, who knew of the limitations specified in the state statute, recently built a new cemetery near the established cemetery. To promote the new cemetery, the former employee sent postcards to local residents asserting that anyone who had already purchased a pre-need funeral plan had \u201can unlimited right to cancel that plan at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\u201d The postcard also offered a $100 rebate on a pre- need funeral plan with the new cemetery to anyone who canceled an existing plan elsewhere. Shortly after the promotion began, several purchasers of funeral plans with the established cemetery canceled their plans and purchased plans from the new cemetery. When the established cemetery withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the purchasers objected and threatened to notify the state consumer protection bureau.

The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Last year, the woman died intestate, leaving a son as her only heir.

Frightened, a passenger pried the inside doors open and impulsively stuck his arm through them to try to stop the fall. As a result, his arm was broken. The elevator eventually stopped without causing further injuries. In a negligence action brought by the injured passenger against the company that installed and maintained the elevator, the injured passenger has asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that it may find the company negligent on a theory of res ipsa loquitur. In response, the company has argued that the passenger\u2019s conduct caused his injuries. How should the judge rule?",

Although it was not her job to unload the truck, the driver would sometimes open the truck\u2019s rear doors after parking it in position. On this occasion, when the driver was about to open the rear doors, she observed through the doors\u2019 windows that some large boxes appeared to be pressed against the doors. At that point, she sought assistance. Two people who were on the loading dock responded to her request: the store\u2019s shipping manager and the manager\u2019s adult friend who was a former employee of the store and was visiting to catch up with the manager. The driver and the friend stood back as the manager opened the doors; no boxes fell out. With the doors open, all three observed a nylon rope that ran tightly across some of the boxes near the doors. As the manager began to cut through the rope, the driver, who with the friend remained at a distance, said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d A moment later, the friend noticed that the padlock from the truck\u2019s rear doors had fallen to the dock floor between him and the truck. Without saying anything to the manager or the driver, the friend took several steps forward to retrieve the lock. At that instant, the manager succeeded in cutting the rope, and the boxes that had been held in place by the rope fell and hit the friend\u2019s head, injuring him. The friend has sued the store for negligence. The jurisdiction has a system of modified comparative fault but also recognizes assumption of risk as a distinct and complete defense.

To obtain a license, a tutor is required to achieve a passing score on a state-administered exam in the tutor\u2019s area of specialty. On several occasions, an organization representing tutors licensed in the state has successfully lobbied against proposed legislation that would have eased the licensing requirement. An out-of-state tutoring company would like to conduct business in the state, but very few of its tutors are licensed by the state. The company has sued to challenge the law.

        "question": "The owner of a home in a rural area had for many years enjoyed unspoiled views of the surrounding countryside from her back deck. Several months ago, a neighboring farmer placed unsightly items, including an old, rusted tractor and some machine parts, entirely on his own property, but in a location visible from the homeowner\u2019s deck. The homeowner asked the farmer to move the items to a different area of the farm, out of the homeowner\u2019s line of sight. The farmer acknowledged that it was not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in locations visible to neighbors, but nonetheless refused to move the items. Concerned that the farmer\u2019s placement of the items might adversely affect the resale value of the property, the homeowner paid for an appraisal of her own property. The appraisal determined that the market value of the property had not been diminished by the farmer\u2019s actions. If the homeowner were to sue the farmer for private nuisance, which of the following would be the farmer\u2019s best argument against liability?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The unsightly items have not caused a decrease in the market value of the homeowner\u2019s property.",
            "optionB": "B. The unsightly items do not physically encroach on the homeowner\u2019s property.",
            "optionC": "C. It is not common for farmers in the area to keep old equipment on their land in places that are visible to neighbors.",
            "optionD": "D. Unsightly conditions ordinarily do not of themselves amount to an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of a neighboring property."

        "question": "A woman who owned an apartment building decided to give the building to a man whose wife she did not care for. The woman signed and promptly recorded a deed properly describing the property and identifying the man by name. The deed specified that under no circumstances was the property \u201cto ever pass to [the man\u2019s wife].\u201d Unbeknownst to the woman, the man had died before she executed and recorded the deed. Under the man\u2019s duly probated will, he had devised all of his property to his wife. When the woman learned of the man\u2019s death, she said in the presence of several witnesses, \u201cI must take back that deed, because I don\u2019t want [the man\u2019s wife] to own the apartment building.\u201d Before the woman could do anything about the deed, however, she died. By her duly probated will, she left all of her estate to her niece. There are no applicable statutes. In an appropriate action to determine the ownership of the apartment building, who will likely prevail?",
