        "question": "Under a state law, oil and gas rights can pass by will or through intestate succession. Some oil and gas rights in the state have been divided into very small interests after several generations of passing by intestate succession. It therefore is difficult to enter into extraction contracts in the state because of the need to include large numbers of heirs for any given tract of land. To remedy this problem, the state has enacted a law that provides that, at the death of an owner of less than 1% of the oil and gas interests in a tract of land, that owner\u2019s oil and gas rights are extinguished and his or her interests are transferred pro rata to the remaining owners. Is this law constitutional?",

Her lawyer advised her to plead guilty, citing overwhelming evidence that included a video recording of her confession and multiple witnesses. The woman repeatedly asked whether a guilty plea might lead to her deportation because she had come to the United States as a child and had lawful permanent resident status but not citizenship. The lawyer assured the woman that the charge would not result in deportation and emphasized the unusually favorable terms of the plea bargain. The woman accepted the plea offer. At the end of the woman\u2019s short prison term, immigration authorities informed her that the conviction required her deportation. The woman filed a motion to vacate the plea, citing ineffective assistance of counsel. How is the court likely to rule?",

The owner\u2019s price is usually lower than the prices of other bidders because the owner\u2019s equipment and personnel are located in the town. In a recent town mayoral election, the owner supported the candidate challenging the incumbent mayor. The owner\u2019s paving trucks carried bumper stickers promoting the challenger. When the incumbent mayor saw the owner in a local restaurant, the mayor said, \u201cYou\u2019d better get those bumper stickers off your trucks or you\u2019ll never pave another road in this town again.\u201d The owner refused to comply. The incumbent mayor won the election. When the road construction projects for the next year were put out to bid, the owner of the local paving company was again the lowest bidder.

The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck. The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail.

The attorney explained that she had been so busy that she had been unable to depose key witnesses or discuss settlement options with her client. The defendant objected to the extension on the ground that there had been ample time to prepare and that the delay would result in increased costs. Is the court likely to grant the motion?",

Citing the need for efficiency, the city implemented a plan to replace old electric meters with wireless meters in businesses and residences. The city\u2019s plan did not include advance notice to property owners or a method to obtain consent from property owners. A homeowner who opposed the installation of the wireless meters was denied his request for a hearing on the city\u2019s plan. The homeowner then blocked the city\u2019s access to his house, obstructing the city\u2019s effort to replace the old meter. The city responded by threatening to arrest and prosecute the homeowner for disorderly conduct. The homeowner then sued the city in federal district court, challenging the meter-replacement plan on due process grounds and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The city moved to dismiss. While the city\u2019s motion was pending, the city council passed an emergency ordinance requiring both prior notice and property owner consent before the removal or replacement of any electric meter.

The promissory note contained a clause that permitted the lender to accelerate the outstanding loan balance if the owner defaulted on the terms of the loan unless the owner cured the default within 10 days of a notice of default. The mortgage required the owner to make loan payments, maintain casualty insurance, and pay property taxes. The owner made the loan payments when due but neglected to pay an insurance premium. When the lender learned that the owner was not maintaining the insurance, the lender notified the owner that the loan was in default and that it planned to accelerate the loan unless the lender received notification within 10 days that the premium had been paid. The owner failed to pay the premium within that time period, and the insurer notified both the owner and the lender that it was canceling the coverage. In order to protect itself from a potential loss, the lender had the insurance policy reinstated by paying the delinquent premium. The owner then promptly tendered the amount of the delinquent insurance premium payment to the lender, but the lender refused to accept it. The lender accelerated the loan, and after the owner failed to pay the accelerated amount, the lender initiated a foreclosure action.

        "question": "A defendant was tried in federal court for bank fraud. The defendant had retained private defense counsel. As part of the prosecution\u2019s case, a federal agent testified regarding incriminating statements that the defendant\u2019s confederate, who by the time of trial was a fugitive, had made during a prior interview. Though this testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, the defense attorney raised no objection. The jury ultimately convicted the defendant. The defendant has now hired new counsel for his appeal and argues that the admission of the federal agent\u2019s testimony was erroneous. If the appeals court finds that the trial court should not have admitted the testimony, does it have the authority to reverse a conviction when the trial attorney raised no objection to the challenged testimony?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because failure to object waives a defendant\u2019s rights.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because the sole remedy is a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.",
            "optionC": "C. Yes, because a defendant cannot be penalized for an attorney\u2019s failure to object.",
            "optionD": "D. Yes, because an appeals court may correct plain error affecting substantial rights."

        "question": "A seller agreed in writing to specially manufacture a machine for a buyer for $100,000, with payment due on delivery. The seller expected to make a profit of $10,000 on the sale. After the seller had spent $30,000 on production of the machine and before the machine was complete, the buyer repudiated the contract. After the repudiation, the seller reasonably believed that if it completed the manufacture of the machine, it would be able to sell the machine to a third party. The seller completed the machine and sold it to a third party for $92,000. If the seller sues the buyer for breach of contract, how much, if anything, should the seller recover as damages?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. $8,000, the amount of the seller\u2019s lost profit after selling the completed machine to the third party.",
            "optionB": "B. $10,000, the seller\u2019s anticipated profit had the buyer not repudiated.",
            "optionC": "C. $40,000, the amount the seller spent on production of the machine before the buyer\u2019s repudiation plus the seller\u2019s anticipated profit.",
            "optionD": "D. Nothing, because the seller had a duty not to complete the manufacture of the machine after the buyer repudiated."

        "question": "A defendant has been indicted for shooting a gun at a local official. She has raised an insanity defense. At trial, the defendant\u2019s attorney seeks to call a qualified psychiatrist as an expert witness. The psychiatrist would testify (1) that at the time of the shooting the defendant suffered from schizophrenia and heard voices commanding her to shoot the official, and (2) that because of these auditory hallucinations, the defendant was legally insane at the time of the shooting. The prosecutor objects to the proposed testimony. What is the proper ruling for the court to make?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The psychiatrist\u2019s testimony is admissible in its entirety, because it will be helpful to the jury.",
            "optionB": "B. The psychiatrist\u2019s testimony is admissible in its entirety, because the bar on expert testimony about a criminal defendant\u2019s mental state applies to the prosecution\u2019s expert witnesses only.",
            "optionC": "C. The psychiatrist\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations is admissible, but the testimony about whether the defendant was legally insane at the time of the shooting is inadmissible.",
            "optionD": "D. The psychiatrist\u2019s testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because an expert witness may not testify about a criminal defendant\u2019s mental state."

        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because the demonstrators\u2019 conduct is not protected by the First Amendment.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because the demonstrators\u2019 protected expression may be validly subject to content- neutral regulation such as the public nudity ordinance.",
            "optionC": "C. Yes, because the city park is a public forum.",
            "optionD": "D. Yes, because the demonstrators\u2019 conduct constitutes protected speech and the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to further a substantial government interest."

        "question": "At his death, a father devised a life estate in land to his daughter and the remainder to his son. The daughter later purported to convey a fee simple absolute interest in the land by warranty deed to a purchaser in exchange for valuable consideration. The purchaser properly recorded the deed. The son then transferred his remainder interest in the land to the daughter by quitclaim deed. The daughter died, leaving her husband as her sole beneficiary and executor. The husband has consulted an attorney to determine the ownership of the land. What advice should the attorney give the husband?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The husband owns the land, because the warranty deed conveyed the land as a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser.",

            "optionC": "C. The purchaser owns a life estate in the land, and the husband owns the remainder.",
            "optionD": "D. The son owns the land, because the remainder was not alienable."
