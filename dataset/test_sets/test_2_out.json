        "question": "In a suit based on a will, inheritance of $1 million depended upon whether the wife had survived her husband when both died in the crash of a small airplane. An applicable statute provided that, for purposes of distributing an estate after a common disaster, there was a rebuttable presumption that neither spouse had survived the other. A witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane she heard what she thought was a woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d although by the time the two occupants were removed from the wreckage they were both dead. Is the witness\u2019s testimony admissible?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because the witness\u2019s testimony is too speculative to support a finding.",
            "optionC": "C. Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.",

        "question": "A defendant was lawfully arrested without a warrant for bank robbery. He was not given Miranda warnings, but was immediately taken to a police station where he and five other men were placed in a lineup to be viewed by the bank teller. Each man was required to say the words spoken by the bank robber: \u201cGive me all your money. I\u2019ve got a gun.\u201d After all the men in the lineup spoke those words, the teller identified the defendant as the robber. The defendant subsequently moved to suppress the testimony of the teller, claiming the lineup violated his privilege against self-incrimination. At a suppression hearing, the teller testified that she had not gotten a good look at the robber\u2019s face, because the robber had been wearing a hat pulled down over most of his face, but that she was certain the defendant was the robber because she had recognized his voice at the lineup. Should the defendant\u2019s motion be granted?",

            "optionA": "A. No, because being required to speak at the lineup, while compelled, was not testimonial or communicative.",

            "optionC": "C. Yes, because the defendant was compelled to speak at the lineup, and this compelled speech led to the witness\u2019s\nidentification testimony.",

        "question": "A city owned and operated a municipal bus system. The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization\u2019s request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization\u2019s placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator\u2019s decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?",
        "options": {

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The space on city buses used for the posting of placards qualifies as a designated public forum because it is public property that the city has decided to open for an expressive use. The organization\u2019s placard was consistent with the city\u2019s designated use of the forum. The city administrator\u2019s denial of space to the organization was based on the content of the placard and therefore triggered strict scrutiny, which requires that the denial be necessary to serve a compelling government interest. The reasons cited for the city\u2019s denial of the organization\u2019s request do not implicate compelling government interests that would justify a content-based speech restriction."

        "question": "A landowner who owned a large tract of land in the mountains sought to protect a herd of wild deer that frequented the area. Although the landowner had posted signs that said, \u201cNo Hunting\u2014No Trespassing,\u201d hunters frequently intruded to kill the deer. Recently, the landowner built an eight-foot chain-link fence, topped by three strands of barbed wire, across a gully on her land that provided the only access to the area frequented by the deer. A wildlife photographer asked the landowner for permission to enter the property to photograph the deer. Because the landowner feared that any publicity would encourage further intrusions, she denied the photographer\u2019s request. Frustrated, the photographer attempted to climb the fence. He became entangled in the barbed wire and suffered extensive lacerations. The wounds became infected and ultimately caused his death. The photographer\u2019s personal representative brought an action against the landowner. Will the plaintiff prevail?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Yes, because the landowner may not use deadly force to protect her land from intrusion.",
            "optionB": "B. Yes, because the landowner had no property interest in the deer that entitled her to use force to protect them.",

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The landowner is privileged to protect her property from intrusion by a means not intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily harm.

When the smoker lit a cigarette, the nonsmoker politely requested that he not smoke, explaining that she had a severe allergy to cigarette smoke. The smoker ignored the nonsmoker\u2019s request and continued to smoke. As a result, the nonsmoker was hospitalized with a severe allergic reaction to the smoke. The nonsmoker brought a battery action against the smoker. Which of the following questions will NOT be an issue in the battery action?",

When the woman left for the evening, the hotel manager opened the hotel room door so the officer could enter the room and look inside. The officer did not find any of the stolen money but did see, lying open on the bed, the woman\u2019s diary. The diary contained an entry describing the woman\u2019s involvement in robbing the bank. The woman was charged in federal court with bank robbery. She moved to suppress the diary. Should the court suppress the diary?",

The authorities and the fugitive then agreed that in exchange for the fugitive\u2019s testimony against his boss, all charges against the fugitive would be dropped.

Subsequently, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage loan to the bank, and appropriate foreclosure proceedings were initiated. The foreclosure sale resulted in a deficiency. There is no applicable statute. Is the buyer liable for the deficiency?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because even if the buyer assumed the mortgage, the seller is solely responsible for any deficiency.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because the buyer did not sign a promissory note to the bank and therefore has no personal liability.",
            "optionC": "C. Yes, because the buyer assumed the mortgage and therefore became personally liable for the mortgage loan and any\ndeficiency.",
            "optionD": "D. Yes, because the transfer of the mortgage debt to the buyer resulted in a novation of the original mortgage and loan\nand rendered the buyer solely responsible for any deficiency."

        "explanation": "With a mortgage assumption, the buyer who assumes the mortgage debt becomes primarily liable. The man, absent a release by the bank, also is liable, although the man is secondarily liable. This situation can be contrasted with one in which the buyer purchased \u201csubject to the mortgage,\u201d in which case only the man would be liable for any deficiency."

In return, the client agreed to pay the architect a fee of $10,000 to be paid upon the house\u2019s completion. After completion, the client claimed erroneously but in good faith that the architect\u2019s plans were defective. The client orally offered to pay the architect $7,500 in full settlement of the claim for the fee. The architect orally accepted that offer despite the fact that the reasonable value of his services was in fact $10,000. The client paid the architect $7,500 pursuant to their agreement. The architect subsequently sued the client for the remaining $2,500. In a preliminary finding, the trier of fact found that there were no defects in the architect\u2019s plans. Will the architect be likely to prevail in his action against the client for $2,500?",

The defendant might be able to generate cash more quickly by burning down the house and collecting insurance proceeds than by attempting to sell the house. To be relevant under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the evidence need only have \u201cany tendency to make the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Therefore, evidence that has only the slightest probative value can be admitted under this rule."

The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller\u2019s home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance.

Equitable conversion occurs when the contract is capable of specific performance. This contract was silent regarding the risk of loss and there were no conditions to be met. The buyer thus had the equitable title at the time of the loss.

Police saw a man wearing a white hooded sweatshirt and blue sweatpants pacing nervously outside one of the city\u2019s banks just before it closed. The police stopped the man and frisked the outer layers of his clothing for weapons, but found none. They asked the man what he was doing outside the bank and pointed out that he was wearing clothing similar to clothing worn by the perpetrator of recent robberies. After pausing for several moments, the man confessed. The police had not provided him with any Miranda warnings. After being charged with the bank robberies, the man moved to suppress his confession. The parties agreed, and the court properly found, that the police had reasonable suspicion but not probable cause at all times before the man confessed. Should the man\u2019s motion to suppress be granted?",

        "question": "A man owned property that he used as his residence. The man received a loan, secured by a mortgage on the property, from a bank. Later, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank then brought an appropriate action to foreclose the mortgage, was the sole bidder at the judicial sale, and received title to the property as a result of the foreclosure sale. Shortly after the foreclosure sale, the man received a substantial inheritance. He approached the bank to repurchase the property, but the bank decided to build a branch office on the property and declined to sell. If the man prevails in an appropriate action to recover title to the property, what is the most likely reason?",

        "question": "A farmer borrowed $100,000 from a bank and gave the bank a promissory note secured by a mortgage on the farm that she owned. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her. After the farmer promptly and properly recorded that deed, the second bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the farm. The farmer denied the validity of the second bank\u2019s mortgage.

When the second bank failed to appear at the foreclosure proceeding, or to take any other action, the buyer at the sale received the title the farmer had at the time the mortgage was given to the first bank, which was free of any mortgage liens. The buyer and the farmer did not act in collusion, so there could be no claim of fraud when the farmer reacquired her original interest in the farm."

The buyer entered into possession of the land.

The seller has made all mortgage payments timely. The amount of the mortgage debt is 25 percent of the purchase price the buyer will pay, and the land is four times more valuable than the debt owed, so it is likely that the mortgage debt will be paid off by the time the seller must provide the warranty deed, and thus the buyer is not entitled to damages at this time."

The investigation revealed that the sun\u2019s glare off of these trucks blinded the drivers of other vehicles. The state\u2019s legislature then enacted a law prohibiting commercial trucks with polished aluminum trailer exteriors from traveling on the state\u2019s highways. Litigation over the state law resulted in a final decision by the United States Supreme Court that the law impermissibly burdened interstate commerce and, therefore, was unconstitutional. Congress later enacted a statute permitting any state to enact a law regulating the degree of light reflectiveness of the exteriors of commercial trucks using the state\u2019s highways. Is this federal statute constitutional?",

The congressional statute permitting any state to regulate the degree of light reflectiveness of the exteriors of commercial trucks using the state\u2019s highways is a valid enactment of the commerce power because commercial trucks are instrumentalities of interstate commerce."

One evening, unaware of the hit man\u2019s presence, the neighbor tripped as he was walking toward his house, falling and hitting his head against the front steps. Believing that the neighbor was unconscious, the hit man ran over to him and shot him twice in the chest. When the woman learned of the neighbor\u2019s death, she paid the hit man $10,000.

A group of physicians announced its plan to immediately open in the state a diagnostic center that would not be affiliated with a hospital. The state hospital association argued to the state legislature that only hospitals could reliably handle advanced medical technologies.

The colleague received the title the niece said she had. No one had a superior title and thus the covenants of seisin, right to convey, quiet enjoyment, and general warranty were not breached.

        "question": "In response to the need for additional toxic waste landfills in a state, the state\u2019s legislature enacted a law authorizing a state agency to establish five new state-owned and state-operated toxic waste landfills. The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community\u2019s residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens\u2019 group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill. The agency officials moved to dismiss. Which of the following is the most appropriate basis for the court to dismiss this suit?",

Fifteen years ago, after a part of the path located on his land and connecting his cabin to the public highway washed out, the man cleared a small part of his neighbor\u2019s land and rerouted a section of the path through the neighbor\u2019s land. Twelve years ago, the neighbor leased her land to some hunters. For the next 12 years, the hunters and the man who had rerouted the path used the path for access to the highway. A month ago, the neighbor discovered that part of the path was on her land. The neighbor told the man that she had not given him permission to cross her land and that she would be closing the rerouted path after 90 days. The man\u2019s land and the neighbor\u2019s land have never been in common ownership. The period of time necessary to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is 10 years.

The man has used the path for the past 15 years without the neighbor\u2019s permission. His use was open and notorious in that the neighbor could have seen him. His use was continuous and without interruption by the neighbor. His use was actual. An easement acquired by prescription need not be exclusive. With an easement, the owner may make any use of the easement area that does not interfere with the use made by the easement holder unless the easement is expressly noted as exclusive.

The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer\u2019s order was for a rush job, the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day\u2019s delay in delivery after March 15.

Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000.

        "question": "A seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement providing that the seller was to deliver 1,000 cases of candy bars to the buyer during the months of May and June. Under the agreement, the buyer was obligated to make a selection by March 1 of the quantities of the various candy bars to be delivered under the contract. The buyer did not make the selection by March 1, and on March 2 the seller notified the buyer that because of the buyer\u2019s failure to select, the seller would not deliver the candy bars. The seller had all of the necessary candy bars on hand on March 1 and made no additional sales or purchases on March 1 or March 2. On March 2, after receiving the seller\u2019s notice that it would not perform, the buyer notified the seller of its selection and insisted that the seller perform. The seller refused. If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, is the buyer likely to prevail?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because a contract did not exist until selection of the specific candy bars, and the seller withdrew its offer before\nselection.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because selection of the candy bars by March 1 was an express condition to the seller\u2019s duty to perform.",
            "optionC": "C. Yes, because a delay of one day in making the selection did not have a material effect on the seller.",
            "optionD": "D. Yes, because upon the buyer\u2019s failure to make a selection by March 1, the seller had a duty to make a reasonable\nselection."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "UCC \u00a7 2-311 imposes a duty on a buyer to cooperate by specifying the assortment of goods where the contract fails to so provide. A seller can treat the buyer\u2019s failure to specify as a breach by failure to accept the contracted-for goods only if the buyer\u2019s failure to specify materially impacts the seller\u2019s performance. The seller had an available supply of candy bars and had entered into no new contracts. These facts support the conclusion that the buyer\u2019s failure to select did not materially impact the seller\u2019s performance. Therefore the seller unjustifiably refused to accept the buyer\u2019s selection of goods. UCC \u00a7 2-311."

        "question": "A grantor owned two tracts of land, one of 15 acres and another of five acres. The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee\u2019s will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.",
            "optionB": "B. The grantee\u2019s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might\nhave.",
            "optionC": "C. The two tracts of land were not adjacent parcels of real estate, and thus the right to purchase is in gross and is\ntherefore unenforceable.",
            "optionD": "D. Noncompliance with a right to purchase gives rise to a claim for money damages, but not for specific performance."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fifteen years ago each of the parties granted a reciprocal right of first refusal (or a preemptive right) to the other. A right of first refusal is a conditional option. It provides that if the owner ever decides to sell the property, the one holding the right of first refusal has the right to purchase it. In this case, the price for the purchase was to be set by three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers and was thus fair. The right, however, violates the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. The right to purchase is triggered by the decision of one to sell his or her land. In this case, that decision might occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the right was granted. Thus, under the common law, the right of first refusal is struck ab initio. The question notes that the common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in this jurisdiction. Thus, there are no applicable statutory reforms to the rule, and because the question is written with the daughter winning, any statute which may exempt a commercial transaction is inapplicable."

        "question": "In order to combat terrorism, Congress enacted a statute authorizing the President to construct surveillance facilities on privately owned property if the President determined that the construction of such facilities was \u201cnecessary to safeguard the security of the United States.\u201d The statute provided no compensation for the owner of the land on which such facilities were constructed and provided that the surveillance facilities were to be owned and operated by the United States government. Pursuant to this statute, the President has determined that the construction of a surveillance facility on a very small, unused portion of an owner\u2019s large tract of land is necessary to safeguard the security of the United States. The construction and operation of the facility will not affect any of the uses that the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land. The owner has filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the construction of a surveillance facility on the parcel of land at issue without compensation. How should the court rule?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. It would be a taking of the owner\u2019s property for which the owner must be compensated.",

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any permanent physical occupation by the government of private property is a taking for which just compensation to the property owner is required. It is irrelevant that in this case the portion of the owner\u2019s tract of land to be occupied by the government is unused and very small. Nor is it relevant that in this case the construction and operation of the facility will not affect any of the uses that the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land. The permanent physical occupation by the government of the owner\u2019s land would be sufficient by itself to constitute a taking."
