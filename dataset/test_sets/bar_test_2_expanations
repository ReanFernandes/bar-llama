Answer to Question 1.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The law effects a taking of property because it extinguishes an owner’s interest in
real property. It does not matter that the owner’s interest in the property is very small. The law violates the takings clause
because it does not provide just compensation to owners who lose their interests in the affected properties.
Answer B is incorrect. The law does not violate the negative implications of the commerce clause because it does not
discriminate in favor of in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests, and because on these facts any burden on
interstate commerce would not clearly outweigh the state’s legitimate interest in facilitating the production of oil and gas.
Answer C is incorrect. It is true that property inheritance is a privilege created by state law, but that does not permit a
state to use inheritance law to effect takings of an individual’s property. All state laws are subject to the takings clause of
the federal Constitution.
Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of the rational basis test, which does not apply here. The state law
is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation when it takes an individual’s property,
even if the state had a legitimate interest for the taking.
Answer to Question 2.
Answer A is correct. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.
668 (1984), a defendant must show two things: (1) that defense counsel’s performance was deficient and (2) that the
deficiency was prejudicial. In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), the Court held that defense counsel must inform a
defendant of the possibility that a guilty plea will affect immigration status. Here, defense counsel failed to properly
inform the client that her guilty plea could lead to deportation. Indeed, counsel affirmatively misled the client by assuring
her that there would be no such consequence. In so doing, counsel rendered deficient performance that was prejudicial
because it led the client to accept a plea when she otherwise would have chosen to go to trial.
Answer B is incorrect because the woman’s formal admission of guilt, while tendering her guilty plea, was the result of
counsel’s ineffective assistance.
Answer C is incorrect. This answer contains a valid statement of law: In general, defense counsel is not required to
advise a defendant about all collateral consequences of conviction. But in Padilla v. Kentucky, the Court specifically held
that counsel is required to advise about the possibility of immigration consequences. Moreover, counsel’s performance
here was worse than merely failing to advise; counsel affirmatively misadvised the client about the potential immigration
consequences.
Answer D is incorrect. In Lee v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 1958 (2017), the Court explained that the prejudice “inquiry
focuses on a defendant’s decision-making,” an inquiry that does not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction at trial.
Although it may be difficult to show prejudice when the plea led to a more favorable result than the probable outcome at
trial, such a showing is not impossible. When faced with an outcome as dire as deportation, a defendant may reasonably
choose to go to trial, even when that avenue presents only the smallest chance of success.
Answer to Question 3.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Goods are identified to the contract when the seller ships, marks, or otherwise
designates them as goods to which the contract refers. UCC § 2-501. Here the seller marked them before they were
shipped, so identification occurred when the seller put the labels on the kayaks.

 

 Answer A is incorrect. The seller didn’t designate the particular kayaks that were eventually shipped as the ones to
which the contract referred until after the contract between the parties was formed.
Answer C is incorrect. Before the carrier picked up the goods, the seller designated the kayaks that were shipped as the
ones to which the contract referred.
Answer D is incorrect. Before delivery to the outfitter, the seller designated the kayaks that were shipped as the ones to
which the contract referred.
Answer to Question 4.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Under FRE 501, state law governs privilege in a diversity action.
Answers A, B, and C are incorrect for the same reason.
Answer to Question 5.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) requires that factual contentions presented by
an attorney to the court have evidentiary support. Attorneys may rely on affidavits and documents provided by their
clients unless the circumstances suggest that it would be unreasonable to do so or that further inquiry is needed.
Answer A is incorrect. The “safe harbor” requirement in Rule 11 applies only when a party moves for sanctions, not
when the court acts on its own initiative.
Answer C is incorrect. Under Rule 11(b), attorneys certify that factual contentions they present to the court have
evidentiary support, not that they are true. As indicated above, there is nothing in the facts suggesting that the attorney
should have questioned either the signed covenant or the president’s affidavit as containing false information.
Answer D is incorrect. There is no general rule requiring attorneys to verify signatures on documents before presenting
them to a court. Rather, the inquiry under Rule 11(b) is whether the attorney acted to the best of the attorney’s knowledge,
information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry under the circumstances. Here, there are no facts given that
suggest that it would have been unreasonable for the attorney to assume that the signature on the covenant was valid.
Answer to Question 6.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment rights of free expression and
free association apply to government contractors in the same manner these rights apply to government employees. These
rights generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors because of their political beliefs
or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance. It is important here that the
government contract is for road construction, which does not involve political policy making.
Answer A is incorrect. Under some circumstances, it may be a rational decision for the government to award a contract
to a higher-cost bidder. For example, this would occur when the government decides that a lower-cost bidder is not
competent to perform a job, or when a higher-cost bidder will complete a job in substantially less time.
Answer C is incorrect. The fact that state law does not require awarding contracts to the lowest-cost bidder is irrelevant
to the determination whether the mayor’s selection of the other contractor violated the First Amendment. The rights of
free expression and free association generally prohibit government officials from penalizing employees and contractors
because of their political beliefs or associations unless political beliefs or affiliations are relevant to job performance; such

 

 beliefs or affiliations are not relevant to road construction.
Answer D is incorrect. The mayor can require those who work for the town to support its current administration to
ensure that the work is consistent with the administration's policies. But the mayor has other means available to ensure
that the contractor’s work conforms to the job requirements set out by the city. For example, the city can monitor the
contractor’s job performance and require compliance with contract requirements. The contractor’s political conduct is
irrelevant to the type of work in question.
Answer to Question 7.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. A party may avoid a contract if their assent was induced by either a fraudulent or a
material misrepresentation. Here, the misrepresentation about the car’s mileage was not fraudulent, since the woman made
it innocently, but it was material.
Answer A is incorrect. The friend had no duty to have a mechanic check the mileage when his reliance on the odometer
reading was reasonable.
Answer B is incorrect. Because the woman was unaware of the actual mileage, the misrepresentation was not fraudulent,
but an innocent misrepresentation is grounds for avoidance of a contract when the misrepresentation is material.
Answer D is incorrect. Even if the odometer reading constituted an express warranty, the remedy for breach of warranty
would be money damages, not avoidance of the contract.
Answer to Question 8.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. In Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the exigent
circumstances doctrine, which permits warrantless entry, applies even when (lawful) police action precipitates the
exigency. Here, the police lawfully knocked and announced their presence at the door. That lawful conduct gave rise to an
exigency—the concern that evidence was being destroyed—that justified the warrantless entry.
Answer B is incorrect. Although the exigent circumstances doctrine allows police to dispense with a warrant, it does not
allow them to dispense with the requirement of probable cause. Consequently, reasonable suspicion would not suffice to
justify the warrantless entry.
Answer C is incorrect because the exigent circumstances doctrine does not require an inquiry into whether police might
have obtained a warrant. The basis of the doctrine is that officers may proceed without a warrant because of the exigency.
Answer D is incorrect. In Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the broad “police-created exigency”
doctrine that some lower courts had developed. The proper test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether the police
created the exigency by engaging in, or threatening to engage in, conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment. Here, the
police conduct—knocking and announcing their presence—was not itself unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
Answer to Question 9.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. A will speaks at the time of the testator’s death. At that time, the woman did not own
the land because she had lost it in the foreclosure action. At the time of the woman’s death, she only had an interest in the
surplus proceeds, which was personal property that passed to the brother, who is the woman’s residuary legatee.
Answer A is incorrect. Whether the brother or the charity prevails depends on whether the woman owned the land when
she died. How the woman lost ownership of the land is irrelevant.

 
 
Answer B is incorrect. The woman’s intent is irrelevant. When a will specifically disposes of land not owned by the
testator at death, the bequest to the specific legatee adeems (fails).
Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the will was written before the mortgage was granted is irrelevant to the question of
ademption.
Answer to Question 10.
Answer B is correct. The officer cannot lay the foundation for admission of the ledger through the business records
exception, as explained below, but the codefendant can. The codefendant’s testimony would show that the drug activity
was regularly conducted, that the source of information in the records was an insider to the drug activity with personal
knowledge of the transactions, that the entries were made near in time to the transactions, and that the transactions were
routinely recorded.
Answer A is incorrect. The officer does not have the requisite knowledge to testify to the foundational requirements of
the business records exception, i.e., that the drug activity was regularly conducted, that the source of information in the
records was an insider to the drug activity with personal knowledge of the transactions, that the entries were made near in
time to the transactions, and that the transactions were routinely recorded. Therefore, the officer cannot lay the foundation
to admit the ledger through the business records exception.
Answer C is incorrect. The foundation for the business records exception can be satisfied by testimony of any person
with the requisite knowledge of record-keeping and the foundational elements for Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6). An
official “records custodian” is not required to testify.
Answer D is incorrect. The federal courts have uniformly held that illegal activity can be considered a regularly
conducted activity for purposes of the business records exception and that the regularly maintained records of a criminal
enterprise may be admitted through the business records exception when all foundational requirements are demonstrated.
Answer to Question 11.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and the trucker did not contribute to
the accident, so the jury is permitted to conclude that the cattle escaped due to the farmer’s negligence.
Answer A is incorrect. The farmer was in exclusive control of his farm, and since the trucker did not contribute to the
accident, the jury can infer that the cattle escaped due to the farmer’s negligence. While it is of course possible that a third
party let the cattle out of the pen, res ipsa would allow an inference of the farmer’s negligence in this case.
Answer B is incorrect. The trucker needs to establish that the farmer was in exclusive control of the pen, that the accident
would not have occurred but for negligence, and that the accident was not due to the trucker’s own actions.
Answer C is incorrect. Strict liability does not attach to raising cattle, which is not an abnormally dangerous activity.
Answer to Question 12.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(g) allows parties to bring claims against co-
parties. There is no authority under Rule 13(g) to allow an attempt to assert a defense against the plaintiff so as to shift
direct liability for damages owed to the plaintiff to a codefendant.
Answer B is incorrect. The general contractor and the subcontractor were both joined by the corporation as defendants.

 
 
That makes them codefendants under Rule 13(g).
Answer C is incorrect. Even if the corporation’s claim against the general contractor has been dismissed, as long as the
crossclaim remains undetermined, the general contractor and the subcontractor remain in the suit for purposes of that
claim.
Answer D is incorrect. Rule 13(g) specifically provides that a crossclaim may include a claim that the co-party is or
“may be” liable for all or part of the claim asserted in the main action. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure often allow
for the assertion of contingent claims to avoid multiple lawsuits and encourage resolution of the entire controversy among
the parties with a minimum of procedural steps.
Answer to Question 13.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The Supreme Court has held that durational residency requirements such as the state
law here generally violate the right to travel protected through the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Congress does not have the power to contravene the Court’s holding.
Answer A is incorrect. The federal law does not regulate automobile negligence. It regulates bankruptcy proceedings,
which is within Congress’s power to legislate in Article I.
Answer B is incorrect. The federal statute does not violate the no-commandeering principle because it authorizes rather
than requires states to create durational residency requirements.
Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states the elements of rational basis scrutiny, which is not the proper standard. The
Supreme Court has held that durational residency requirements burden the fundamental right to travel, and thus they
receive strict judicial scrutiny, which requires the state to demonstrate that the requirement is necessary to serve a
compelling government interest.
Answer to Question 14.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. When the parties have left gaps in an agreement that is otherwise enforceable, a court
may supply a term that is reasonable in the circumstances.
Answer A is incorrect. The remedy of rescission is not appropriate if the parties intended to have a contract and the court
can supply an omitted term.
Answer B is incorrect. The canon of construction known as contra proferentem—that a writing will be construed against
the drafter—applies only as a last resort to address ambiguous language. Here the franchise agreement is silent rather than
ambiguous on the particular issue.
Answer C is incorrect. To fill a gap in a contract, a court will supply a term that is reasonable, not the term that the
parties might have agreed to.
Answer to Question 15.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The man is guilty of first-degree murder because, while acting with the intent to kill
the neighbor, he inadvertently killed the police officer. In this situation, the doctrine of transferred intent applies to hold
him liable for the intentional killing of the officer.
Answer A is incorrect. To be guilty of capital murder, the man would need to have acted with the intent to kill a police

 
 
officer.
Answer C is incorrect because the man acted with premeditation and malice. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, the
man is therefore guilty of the more serious offense of first-degree murder.
Answer D is incorrect because the question asks for the most serious crime. Although the man is guilty of the attempted
murder of the neighbor, first-degree murder is the more serious offense.
Answer to Question 16.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Under FRE 611(a), a trial judge possesses broad discretion to control the mode and
order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make trial procedures effective for determining truth. A
trial judge who is concerned about a party’s hearing all eyewitness testimony and thereafter tailoring his testimony to that
of other witnesses would not abuse her discretion in ordering that party to testify before the other witnesses.
Answer B is incorrect. The parties typically determine the order in which their evidence will be presented at trial. And
while the trial judge has the discretion to control the order of presentation, determining the order of evidence within a
party’s case is not an obligation that the trial judge must routinely undertake.
Answer C is incorrect. Although parties typically are afforded broad latitude in controlling their presentation of proof,
they are not always permitted to do so; under FRE 611(a), the trial judge has discretion to control the order of
presentation.
Answer D is incorrect. The trial judge has the discretion to alter the order of proof without a showing of specific
prejudice by an opposing party.
Answer to Question 17.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. A buyer is on constructive notice of all information that a search of the land records
would reveal. At issue is whether the entrepreneur had record (constructive) notice of the restriction. If so, the
entrepreneur would not be a good-faith purchaser for value. Courts are divided about whether a buyer is required to search
deeds outside of the chain of title to the land the buyer is purchasing. Here, the deed from the man to the woman is outside
of the entrepreneur’s chain of title even though they share a common grantor. Thus, knowing whether the jurisdiction’s
law puts a buyer on notice of all land transfers of the buyer’s grantor, even those outside of the chain of title, is essential.
If it does, the entrepreneur had a duty to search the title for the westerly tract.
Answer A is incorrect. The type of index does not determine what instruments are in the chain of title.
Answer B is incorrect. The recording system does not affect whether the entrepreneur is a good-faith purchaser for value.
Answer D is incorrect. The intended use of the land does not affect the determination of whether the entrepreneur was
aware of the recorded restriction.
Answer to Question 18.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The driver might have a valid strict products liability claim against the manufacturer.
However, the manufacturer’s knowledge of a small statistical likelihood of tire failure is not by itself sufficient to support
a finding—required for battery liability—that the manufacturer acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, or with the
knowledge that a harmful contact would occur. Thus, the court should grant the manufacturer’s partial summary judgment
motion.

 

 Answer A is incorrect. Even if a reasonable jury could conclude that a responsible manufacturer would have taken
greater care, that finding would not establish the intent necessary for battery liability.
Answer B is incorrect. The evidence of a relatively small statistical likelihood of tire failure does not satisfy the
“substantial certainty” element required for battery liability. The manufacturer knew to a substantial certainty that a few of
its tires would rupture. It did not know to a substantial certainty that particular persons would be injured as a result of
those ruptures.
Answer C is incorrect. There is no rule of tort law stating that a plaintiff is prohibited from pursuing claims for battery
and products liability on the basis of the same set of facts.
Answer to Question 19.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b)(4) states that in order to have a scheduling
order modified, the moving party must show “good cause.” This requires a showing that the party acted diligently to try to
meet the original deadline.
Answer B is incorrect. If the moving party shows good cause, the court can amend any of the dates or deadlines in the
scheduling order, including the trial date or the date for jury selection.
Answer C is incorrect. Whether additional time could facilitate a settlement is immaterial, because it does not speak to
whether the moving party can show the required diligence needed to establish good cause.
Answer D is incorrect. The busy schedule of the plaintiff’s attorney did not establish the good cause needed to amend the
scheduling order, which is why the motion should be denied. A party opposing a requested extension would need to show
prejudice that would likely result from the extension only if the moving party had first met its burden to show good cause.
Answer to Question 20.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The case is moot because the only relief sought by the homeowner is no longer
available. Allready LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85 (2013).
Answer A is incorrect. “Capable of repetition yet evading review” applies only in situations where litigation is unlikely
to be completed because of the short-term nature of an issue, such as review of an explicitly short-term legal mandate.
Answer B is incorrect. The voluntary cessation exception does not apply when it is unreasonable to expect that the
allegedly unlawful conduct will recur. The emergency ordinance’s explicit requirements of prior notice and owner consent
make it unreasonable to expect that the city will attempt to change the homeowner’s meter without prior notice and the
homeowner’s consent. In addition, the only relief sought by the homeowner was an injunction against the previous
ordinance, which is no longer in effect.
Answer D is incorrect. Ripeness is determined when a suit is filed. The case was ripe given the city’s attempts to install
the meter and its threats of prosecution.
Answer to Question 21.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. A Miranda warning is required whenever a suspect is (1) in custody and (2)
being subjected to custodial interrogation. Here, the parolee was not in custody. As the Court explained in

 
 
Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), the “in custody” requirement is not met simply because a probationer or
parolee is under a general obligation to appear and answer questions truthfully. Instead, a person is “in custody” only
when under “formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.”
Answer A is incorrect because parolees do retain their Fifth Amendment rights. However, parolees are entitled to receive
Miranda warnings only when being subjected to custodial interrogation. In all other contexts, parolees must affirmatively
assert the privilege against compelled self-incrimination.
Answer C is incorrect for the reasons given in the explanations for answers B and A. Law enforcement interrogation is
not enough. The suspect also must be in custody.
Answer D is incorrect because a probation or parole officer may in fact compel both attendance and truthful answers.
However, as the Court held in Minnesota v. Murphy, neither of those entitlements transforms the exchange into a custodial
interrogation.
Answer to Question 22.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. A commercial seller of a nondefective component part that is incorporated into a
finished product by the product’s manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by the product unless the seller
substantially participated in the integration of the part into the design of the finished product, and the integration of the
component is what rendered the finished product defective. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability § 5 (1998). In
this case, the distributor did not participate, much less substantially participate, in the integration of the sand into the
defective concrete used in the columns and thus is not subject to liability under the doctrine of strict products liability.
Answer A is incorrect. The rule it states is too broad: a commercial seller of a component part can sometimes be strictly
liable for an injury caused by a defective product into which the part is integrated (namely, when the conditions specified
in the explanation for answer B are met).
Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the columns were defective does not render the distributor liable under the doctrine
of strict products liability.
Answer D is incorrect. The mere knowledge that the sand needed to be properly mixed with water and cement to make
sound concrete is not sufficient to render the distributor liable for an injury caused by the defective concrete.
Answer to Question 23.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to grand jury proceedings under FRE
1101(d)(2).
Answer A is incorrect. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to grand jury proceedings under FRE
1101(d)(2), Rule 702 is not applicable.
Answer B is incorrect. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to grand jury proceedings under FRE
1101(d)(2), Rule 701 regarding lay opinion testimony is not applicable.
Answer D is incorrect. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to grand jury proceedings under FRE
1101(d)(2), Rule 701 regarding lay opinion testimony is not applicable.
Answer to Question 24.

 

 Explanation: Answer B is correct. The man’s death frustrated the purpose of the contract because his being alive for the
lessons was a basic assumption of the contract. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 265.
Answer A is incorrect. While this statement is true, it is not relevant. Once a contract is formed, the lapse of a related
offer is not meaningful.
Answer C is incorrect. The instructor’s fault is immaterial to any frustration-of-purpose defense the estate might assert.
Only the fault of the party that seeks to be discharged from its obligation prevents application of that defense.
Answer D is incorrect. The man’s death discharges his contractual obligations under the doctrine of frustration of
purpose when his being alive to take the flying lessons was a basic assumption of the contract.
Answer to Question 25.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. This house is not new construction where a seller may have a duty of disclosure.
There are no applicable statutes that may require disclosure. The seller asked the buyer whether she wanted to inspect the
property, but the buyer declined. An “as is” clause will be enforced when there is no positive misrepresentation or
fraudulent concealment.
Answer A is incorrect. A court will enforce an “as is” clause in residential sales as long as there is no positive
misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment, neither of which is present in these facts.
Answer B is incorrect. A warranty deed provides protection for title issues, not issues of physical condition.
Answer D is incorrect. The merger doctrine is irrelevant. Under that doctrine, acceptance of the warranty deed
extinguishes all contractual promises of the seller relating to the quality of title. Here, the suit is about the condition of the
residence, not its title. The “as is” clause extinguishes claims based upon termites, as that clause eliminates any
contractual duty of the seller to deliver a residence free of termites.
Answer to Question 26.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a judgment on the pleadings may be
made after the pleadings are closed. However, because the defendant in this case has asserted a counterclaim in its answer,
the plaintiff must file an answer to the counterclaim under Rule 7(a)(3) before making any motions.
Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 10(c), a party may attach a written instrument to the complaint, and it becomes part of
the pleadings to which the defendant must respond. Nothing in Rule 12(c) precludes a party from moving for judgment
based on admissions made regarding an incorporated document.
Answer C is incorrect. There is no requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that when a plaintiff moves
for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must file a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, in its
discretion, may choose to file its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or it may simply defend against the
plaintiff’s motion.
Answer D is incorrect. The fact that the defendant has not denied the alleged failure to deliver goods does not in itself
support the grant of the motion. The plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings seeks judgment not only on its
primary claim for damages but also on the defendant’s counterclaim for nonpayment. Because the plaintiff has not yet
answered the counterclaim, the pleadings are not closed on that issue, and a judgment on the pleadings would be
premature.

 

 Answer to Question 27.
Explanation: Answer A is correct because on its face the ordinance discriminates against commerce from outside the
city. By doing so, it necessarily excludes commerce from outside the state. Even though the ordinance also excludes some
commerce from within the state, it is still considered facially discriminatory. Such facially discriminatory laws are
allowed only in the absence of any nondiscriminatory way to promote the government’s interest. C&A Carbone, Inc. v.
Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994).
Answer B is incorrect. Answer B states the elements of heightened scrutiny for an individual rights claim, but none of
the factors that support heightened scrutiny for such a claim are present here. In the absence of a burden on interstate
commerce or impingement on some fundamental right or suspect class, a law needs only a rational basis connecting it
with a legitimate government interest.
Answer C is incorrect. Because the law is facially discriminatory, it is not subject to the “undue burden” test. In addition,
we do not have sufficient facts to know whether the ordinance would pass this test.
Answer D is incorrect. The right to travel does not protect the right to engage in commercial enterprises while
temporarily present in a state.
Answer to Question 28.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The arborist’s performance was discharged by impracticability because the non-
occurrence of the vandalism and fire was a basic assumption of the contract. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 261.
But the arborist is entitled to restitution for the value of the part of the contract that the arborist performed before that
discharge. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 272 & 377.
Answer A is incorrect. Expectation damages are a remedy for breach of contract, and here the owner is not in breach.
Answer C is incorrect. The arborist would be entitled to restitutionary relief whether the parties’ performance was
excused by impracticability or frustration of purpose.
Answer D is incorrect. As explained above, the arborist’s failure to complete the work was excused by impracticability,
and the arborist is entitled to recover in restitution for the benefit conferred.
Answer to Question 29.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. In Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme Court held that a
warrant is required to collect extensive historical site-location data from a cell-phone provider. Here, the data sought was
one year’s worth of site-location information, which clearly falls within the rule of Carpenter. In addition, Carpenter
rejected the use of a subpoena to circumvent this warrant requirement.
Answer A is incorrect. Though answer A states a Fourth Amendment principle that is generally true—namely, that there
is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information shared with a third party, known as the “third party doctrine”—the
Court in Carpenter specifically rejected this doctrine for historical cell-phone site-location data.
Answer B is incorrect because the cell-phone number is not the targeted evidence. Although the phone number may be
widely accessible, that fact does not create a right of access to historical cell-phone site-location data (which is created by
the cell-phone provider) or to the contents of the phone itself.

 

 Answer C is incorrect for two reasons. First, a subpoena need not be based on “probable cause.” Second, Carpenter held
that the government could not rely on a subpoena to obtain historical cell-phone site-location data. As a rule, when the
government wants to obtain that sort of data, it must first get a warrant.
Answer to Question 30.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The tenant has a serious hearing impairment, which is a handicap under the Fair
Housing Act. The Act requires the landlord to make a reasonable accommodation for such a handicap, and the tenant’s
need for a trained service dog outweighs any concerns underlying the landlord’s prohibition of pets.
Answer A is incorrect. The Act does not apply if the owner occupies a unit in a building with four or fewer units. This
building has 10 units, and thus the exception does not apply.
Answer B is incorrect. The fact that the tenant agreed to the “no pets” provision in the lease does not relieve the landlord
from making a reasonable accommodation for the tenant’s handicap.
Answer C is incorrect. The landlord’s refusal to permit the tenant to have a service dog may be arbitrary, but that is
irrelevant because the Act requires the landlord to make a reasonable accommodation for the tenant’s hearing impairment.
Answer to Question 31.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Under FRE 408(a)(2), statements made during settlement negotiations in a private
civil action—negotiations not involving a public office—are inadmissible in a subsequent criminal case arising out of the
same incident.
Answer A is incorrect. When offered by the prosecution, the driver’s statement to the woman is a statement of an
opposing party, and therefore it would come within the exception to the hearsay rule set out in FRE 801(d)(2)(A).
Answer C is incorrect. FRE 408(a)(2) distinguishes between settlement negotiations involving private parties and those
involving a public office. Statements made in negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its
enforcement authority may be admissible in a subsequent criminal case. But statements made in negotiations with a
private party are not admissible in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
Answer D is incorrect. The statement is inadmissible under FRE 408(b)(2). FRE 403’s balancing test has no role in the
analysis. Moreover, the balancing test is improperly stated in the answer.
Answer to Question 32.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The doctor can implead the grocery store, because the fact-finder could find that the
negligence of both the grocery store and the doctor contributed to the total injury suffered by the shopper, including the
worsening of her injury resulting most immediately from the doctor’s malpractice.
Answer A is incorrect. The question is not about the standard of care applicable to the doctor and the store, but rather
whether the store, if found negligent, can be held responsible along with the doctor not only for the shopper’s initial injury
but also for the worsening of the injury as a result of the doctor’s malpractice.
Answer B is incorrect. The mere fact that the doctor’s malpractice happened after any possible negligence on the part of
the store does not defeat the imposition of liability on the store for the worsening of the shopper’s injury caused by the
doctor’s malpractice.

 

 Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the doctor’s negligence and the store’s negligence (if any) both contributed to the
plaintiff’s injury provides a basis for why the doctor can implead the grocery store.
Answer to Question 33.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court must
determine, after considering all the evidence introduced by both parties, whether there is legally sufficient evidence to
support a judgment for the estate. The executor, who bears the burden of proof, has presented only the testimony of
another bike rider who was not a true eyewitness to the decedent’s accident, but who provided circumstantial evidence
about what he saw before and after it. In contrast, the man has provided three disinterested witnesses who testified that
they never saw any contact between the man and the decedent. Because the testimony of the witnesses is not in actual
conflict, and because the executor has not presented legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict in the estate’s favor,
the motion should be granted.
Answer A is incorrect. The executor’s evidence consists of one witness who did not actually see the accident but testified
to circumstances that might or might not suggest that the man was at fault. In light of the direct evidence provided by the
man’s testimony and that of his three witnesses, the executor’s evidence would not be legally sufficient for the jury to find
for the executor, who is the party with the burden of proof at trial.
Answer B is incorrect. The witnesses’ testimony is not in direct conflict, since the executor’s witness did not actually see
the accident or any contact between the man’s bike and the decedent’s bike, and the man’s witnesses testified that they
never saw any contact between the two. Thus, there is no real credibility dispute.
Answer C is incorrect. In determining whether to grant judgment as a matter of law, the court is not to weigh the
evidence but rather is to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the party who bears
the burden of proof at trial, in this case the nonmoving party.
Answer to Question 34.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Although there was no consideration for the modification, under the modern rule of
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 89, a modification is binding “if the modification is fair and equitable in view of
circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the contract was made.”
Answer A is incorrect. This is the answer under the pre-existing duty rule, but that rule does not apply when a
modification is fair and equitable in light of changed circumstances.
Answer B is incorrect. This answer would be correct if the subcontractor were asking for relief on the basis of its
mistake, but it is not relevant when the subcontractor is seeking to enforce a modification.
Answer D is incorrect. Relief based on restitution is not applicable when there is an enforceable contract.
Answer to Question 35.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The state-created easement provides for the physical occupation of a portion of the
owner’s farm and thus constitutes a government taking of that portion of land. The takings clause requires that the
government provide just compensation to owners for the land it takes. Just compensation is determined by the fair market
value of the taken land. Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to recover costs from hikers who use the
trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to the fair market value of an easement across the land.
Answer A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has held that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth

 
 
Amendment is limited to rights of a special national nature, such as the right to travel. The clause does not apply here.
Answer C is incorrect. Just compensation is determined by the fair market value of the property taken by the state.
Although the state law allows the owner to charge a fee to hikers who use the trail on the farm, the fee is not equivalent to
the fair market value of an easement across the land at issue.
Answer D is incorrect. The state law is subject to the takings clause, which requires the state to pay just compensation
when it takes an individual’s property, even if the taking serves a public purpose.
Answer to Question 36.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Fraud in the execution of a deed is the equivalent of a forged deed; as a result, the
deed is void.
Answer A is incorrect. A forged signature is only one example of a condition that makes a deed void; fraud in the
execution of a deed is the equivalent of a forged deed.
Answer B is incorrect. Fraud in the execution of a deed is treated like a forged deed, and a bona fide purchaser is not
protected. Both the grantor (the father) and the bona fide purchaser (the investor) are innocent; however, the father is
favored as he is entirely blameless.
Answer C is incorrect. The father’s executed will gave no rights, at the time of the will’s execution, to any beneficiaries
named in the will. Whether the wife owns the apartment building depends on whether the father owned the building when
he died.
Answer to Question 37.
Answer D is correct. In United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304 (2000), the Court held that the erroneous denial
of a challenge for cause does not warrant reversal if the prospective juror ultimately does not serve on the jury. Here,
because the prospective juror was ultimately excused through a peremptory challenge, the appellate court would reject the
defendant’s argument and uphold the conviction.
Answer A is incorrect because the right to an impartial jury is not violated if the prospective juror does not serve.
Answer B is incorrect. In Martinez-Salazar, the Court specifically rejected the suggestion that a defendant is prejudiced
by having to use a peremptory challenge to cure an erroneous denial of a challenge for cause.
Answer C is incorrect because the reason for upholding the conviction is incorrect: the trial court should have removed
the prospective juror for cause and, in refusing to do so, abused its discretion.
Answer to Question 38.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Because the fire marshal is a public official and his conclusion about the cause of the
fire is a factual finding based upon an official investigation, the report is admissible under the public records exception to
the hearsay rule. The witness’s statement quoted in the report is not admissible under the public records exception,
however, because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under a legal duty, and so that statement
must be excised from the report.
Answer B is incorrect. While the report is generally admissible, the witness’s statement quoted in the report is not
admissible under the public records exception because the witness is not a public official reporting matters observed under

 

 a legal duty. Therefore, the portion of the report quoting that statement must be excised before the report is admitted.
Answer C is incorrect. The neighbor is being sued in a civil action. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation protects
defendants only in criminal cases and so does not protect the neighbor in this civil action.
Answer D is incorrect. Public officials may rely on bystander statements and hearsay in making factual findings. To the
extent that a public official’s factual findings rest on only such hearsay, those findings could be excluded for a lack of
trustworthiness under FRE 803(8)(B). Here, the fire marshal’s factual findings rest on his significant experience, as well
as his examination of the scene, and would not be excludable solely due to reliance on some hearsay.
Answer to Question 39.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The company, through its employee, engaged in conduct that a jury could determine
to be intrusion upon seclusion. Intrusion upon seclusion is one of the four privacy torts recognized by the Second
Restatement of Torts and most states. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652A–E (1977).
Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the company did not expressly authorize the security officer’s specific actions does
not necessarily allow it to avoid liability. The security officer was an employee of the company, and the company both
directed the officer to investigate the woman and provided the officer with her phone number. On this basis, a jury could
reasonably hold the company liable based on the officer’s actions.
Answer B is incorrect. The woman’s breach of the noncompetition agreement, if any, would not prevent a reasonable
jury from concluding that the company is liable to the woman for intrusion upon seclusion. Whether the company has a
cause of action against the woman for breach of the agreement is a separate question.
Answer C is incorrect. There is no evidence that the company or the security officer acted with an intent to cause the
woman severe emotional distress, or recklessly with respect to that risk, or even that the woman suffered severe emotional
distress.
Answer to Question 40.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b)(2) provides that a court “must not
extend the time to act” under Rule 50(b), governing renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law.
Answer B is incorrect. Whether “good cause” was or was not shown is immaterial, as Rule 6(b)(2) prohibits
any extensions of time for filing renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law.
Answer C is incorrect. Although the factors mentioned might be relevant to finding good cause to extend time
limits generally, they are irrelevant here because Rule 6(b)(2) prohibits any extensions of time for filing
renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law.
Answer D is incorrect. Rule 6(b)(2) prohibits any extensions for renewed motions for judgment as a matter of
law, and it provides no exception for the parties to agree to alter that prohibition.
Answer to Question 41.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. A law that increases the punishment for a crime after the crime was committed
violates the ex post facto clause. The law here was passed after the woman committed the crime, so the law may not be
applied to her.

 

 Answer B is incorrect. Procedural due process requires that the government provide notice and an opportunity to be
heard before depriving someone of a liberty interest or of an interest in property. The woman received that notice prior to
trial, and the law provides an opportunity for a hearing. However, the law is an unconstitutional ex post facto law as
applied to the woman.
Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest is not the proper
standard. The ex post facto clause is violated by laws that increase the punishment for a crime after the crime was
committed, even if the law furthers a legitimate interest.
Answer D is incorrect. The law constitutes punishment because it increases the consequences for having been found
guilty of committing a crime, and the law increases the punishment for the crime after the woman committed the crime,
violating the ex post facto clause.
Answer to Question 42.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. An oral agreement is within the statute of frauds and is unenforceable if by its terms
it cannot be performed within a year from the making. Here, however, the agreement was made on January 2 and would
be fully performed a year later.
Answer A is incorrect. Full performance of one party’s obligations under an oral agreement removes the statute of frauds
as a defense, but here there was only partial performance by the applicant.
Answer C is incorrect. The agreement could have been performed within a year from its making on January 2.
Answer D is incorrect. The amount of money involved is irrelevant to the application of the common law statute of
frauds.
Answer to Question 43.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The routine practice of the company’s agents in discussing supplemental policy
options with customers is admissible under FRE 406.
Answer A is incorrect. Under FRE 406, evidence of an organization’s routine practice is admissible to prove that on a
particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with that practice. The fact that the woman, an eyewitness, claims
that the practice was not followed in her case does not affect the admissibility of this evidence but rather creates a factual
issue for the jury.
Answer B is incorrect. To constitute habit evidence, an organization’s practice need not be “automatic” but only
routine—something that is regularly done. The supervisor’s testimony here is that the agents’ regular practice is to discuss
supplemental policy options with customers.
Answer C is incorrect. Character evidence is not admissible in civil cases to prove conduct. See FRE 404(a) and (b). This
evidence is admissible only if it is habit evidence—evidence of an organization’s routine practice—under FRE 406.
Answer to Question 44.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Although his method was unusual, the driver committed a battery. Acting with the
intent to cause offensive or harmful contact, the driver caused an offensive or harmful contact.

 

 Answer A is incorrect. The driver is not guilty of attempted murder because the facts do not suggest that he intended to
kill the bicyclist.
Answer B is incorrect. The driver is not guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter because the facts do not suggest that
he intended to kill the bicyclist. The driver cannot be guilty of attempted involuntary manslaughter because, at common
law, that crime did not exist. (Attempted negligence is a legal impossibility.)
Answer D is incorrect because the question calls for the most serious crime of which the driver can be convicted. At
common law, assault required only placing another person in fear of imminent harm. Here, the driver committed the
greater offense of engaging in physical contact.
Answer to Question 45.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The store’s policy, combined with the employee’s grant of permission, conferred on
the student the status of invitee while she was in the storeroom seeking empty boxes.
Answer A is incorrect. The student was an invitee in the storeroom, because the store had a policy of giving empty boxes
to customers and because the employee permitted her to enter the storeroom, and therefore the store owed her a duty of
care.
Answer B is incorrect. Store visitors are not required to intend to purchase anything to be categorized as invitees.
Answer C is incorrect. The student was an invitee in the storeroom, because the store had a policy of giving empty boxes
to customers and because the employee permitted her to enter the storeroom.
Answer to Question 46.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Acceleration clauses are valid. While typically triggered by nonpayment of the
mortgage debt, they can also be triggered by the mortgagor’s failure to satisfy other conditions in the mortgage, such as
timely payment of insurance premiums.
Answer A is incorrect. Once acceleration has properly occurred, the consequences cannot be avoided because the owner
attempts to pay the delinquent insurance premium. Foreclosure can only be avoided by paying the mortgagee the entire
accelerated amount.
Answer B is incorrect for the same reasons given in the explanation for answer A.
Answer C is incorrect. The desire to bring a foreclosure action does not create a right to accelerate a mortgage. Rather,
the right to accelerate depends upon whether a term of a mortgage has been breached. Such a term may include, as here,
the failure to pay an insurance premium.
Answer to Question 47.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) specifically authorizes relief if the
“judgment is void.” Because the court had no personal jurisdiction over the attorney in the action, the judgment is void.
Answer A is incorrect. Relief from a default judgment is available only for the reasons listed under Rule 60(b), and the
attorney first must show that he falls within one of those provisions. If he does not, then it is immaterial that he has a
meritorious defense.

 

 Answer B is incorrect. Rule 60(b) lists six possible grounds for relief from a judgment, and none of them looks to
whether the movant’s conduct was reasonable in the underlying action.
Answer D is incorrect. Rule 60(b)(1) allows for relief from a judgment if it was entered as a result of a “mistake.”
However, it does not provide relief in situations where a party makes a choice that turns out to be a tactical error. Because
the attorney correctly determined that the court lacked jurisdiction, the judgment is void. But if he were wrong, he would
have to accept the consequences of his choice.
Answer to Question 48.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The lease does not explicitly say that the owner may enter the house to show it to
prospective lessees, but such a right may be fairly implied in order to carry out the intention of the parties.
Answer A is incorrect. The principle of reasonable expectations posits that parties should not be bound by terms that
they would not expect to find in a contract unless those terms were called to their attention. That doctrine is not relevant
here.
Answer C is incorrect. Best efforts is a duty read into a contract to prevent it from being illusory when the scope of a
party’s performance is omitted or unclear. The duty of best efforts, which requires all parties to use their best efforts to
carry out the intent of the contract, is not relevant here.
Answer D is incorrect. The objective theory means that a party to a contract is bound by a contract term even if that party
is not subjectively aware of the term; it is not relevant here.
Answer to Question 49.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The ordinance is a content-neutral restriction on speech because it regulates without
regard to the content of the message expressed on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate
judicial scrutiny, the elements of which are summarized in Answer C. The Supreme Court has held that the aesthetic
interests of a community are sufficiently substantial to justify content-neutral restrictions on public displays of signs. The
ordinance here is narrowly tailored because it applies only to scenic roadways and it does not completely ban signs there.
Answer A is incorrect. Even though the ordinance burdens political speech, it is a content-neutral restriction because it
regulates without regard to the message on the billboards. Content-neutral speech restrictions receive intermediate judicial
scrutiny, which requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.
Answer B is incorrect. Although the ordinance restricts speech in a traditional public forum, it is not a total ban of speech
and it is content-neutral. The ordinance therefore does not violate the First Amendment if it satisfies intermediate scrutiny.
The ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny because it is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.
Answer D is incorrect. Answer D states an incorrect standard of judicial review for the ordinance. The ordinance is a
content-neutral restriction on expression, and therefore it must satisfy intermediate judicial scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny
requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.
Answer to Question 50.
Answer B is correct. The Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, although presumptive and powerful, is not
absolute. The Supreme Court in Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337 (1970), held that a defendant can forfeit that right by
behaving in an unruly and disruptive manner, and by refusing to heed a warning to abide by the court rules. In such a case,
held the Court, defense counsel can adequately safeguard the defendant’s rights. Here, the defendant’s disruptive and

 

 threatening behavior compromised both the order in the courtroom and the witness’s ability to testify, and the defendant’s
refusal to heed the court’s warning justified the extreme step of temporarily removing him from the courtroom.
Answer A is incorrect. As a rule, the possibility that testifying may be traumatic or uncomfortable for a witness does not
overcome the defendant’s constitutional rights both to a public trial and to confront witnesses. Although the Court has
recognized limited exceptions in cases involving children—see Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012 (1988) and Maryland v.
Craig, 497 U.S. 836 (1990)—those exceptions are narrow, and they require both the presentation of evidence and specific
findings by the trial court, which did not occur here.
Answers C and D are incorrect because, as shown in the explanation for answer B, there was no error.
Answer to Question 51.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to probation revocation
proceedings under FRE 1101(d), the government may present evidence that would be inadmissible under the rules.
Answer A is incorrect. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to probation revocation proceedings under
FRE 1101(d), whether evidence would be hearsay under the rules is not relevant to the admissibility of that evidence.
Answer B is incorrect. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to probation revocation proceedings under
FRE 1101(d), the rule governing lay opinion testimony is not applicable.
Answer D is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to probation revocation proceedings under FRE
1101(d), and even if they did, the confidential informant’s statement is in fact being offered for its truth—to show the
basis for revoking probation.
Answer to Question 52.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. A reasonable jury could conclude that the father intentionally caused the driver to
apprehend imminent harmful physical contact, as is required for assault liability.
Answer B is incorrect. There was no battery because the father never touched the driver. Even under the “extended
personality” doctrine—which, for example, allows a battery plaintiff to establish the necessary contact element if the
defendant touches an article of clothing the plaintiff is wearing—making contact with the bus is almost certain not to
count as contacting the driver’s person.
Answer C is incorrect. Establishing the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires showing
both that the defendant intended to cause severe distress and that the defendant’s conduct was extreme and outrageous.
These elements will be harder for the driver to establish than will the elements of an assault claim.
Answer D is incorrect. The driver is not likely to be considered to have a possessory interest in the damaged bus, and
therefore trespass to chattels would not be a viable claim.
Answer to Question 53.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The man conveyed an express easement over his land to his neighbor by a deed of
gift, which satisfied the statute of frauds. Although the location of the easement was not in writing, the location was set by
the neighbor’s 14-year use of a 15-foot strip on the west side of the man’s land.
Answer A is incorrect. The deed granting the easement satisfied the statute of frauds. Although the location of the

 
 
easement was not fixed in the deed, the location was established by the neighbor’s 14-year use of the 15-foot strip along
the west side of the man’s land.
Answer B is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the neighbor only asked to relocate the easement because her cabin was
destroyed by fire. The location of the easement was set by the neighbor’s 14-year use of the easement on the west side of
the man’s land.
Answer C is incorrect. An express easement may be made by a deed of gift.
Answer to Question 54.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. If an action includes claims based on federal law and state law, and if those claims
involve overlapping facts and evidence, rather than being separate and distinct, typically the court will not enter a final
judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on the claim that has been resolved. This practice is to avoid
duplication of effort in the appellate and trial courts.
Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 54(b), it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that is authorized to direct entry
of final judgment as to fewer than all claims.
Answer C is incorrect. Waiting until a final judgment on the entire action is entered will always delay plaintiffs’
recovery. If that factor controlled, every claim determined in a multiple-claim action before a final judgment was reached
in the entire action would be immediately appealable. That would be inconsistent with the final judgment rule and the
limited role envisioned for Rule 54(b).
Answer D is incorrect. There is no final judgment in the case, and as discussed in the explanation for answer B, a court
will not enter a Rule 54(b) final judgment when there is overlap between resolved and unresolved claims, including when
the resolution of some claims was by summary judgment.
Answer to Question 55.
Explanation: Answer B is correct because the common law rule that deadly force cannot be used in defense of property
remains the rule in virtually every state today.
Answer A is incorrect. The “duty to retreat” rule, which has been removed in most states, limits one’s ability to use
deadly force in self-defense. The rule does not apply in defense-of-property cases because in that context deadly force is
categorically disallowed.
Answer C is incorrect because the act described—intentionally shooting a man with a shotgun—clearly qualifies as
“deadly force.” Although states define the term in various ways, “deadly force” is generally regarded as the kind of force
that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death whether or not the serious bodily injury or death actually occurs.
Answer D is incorrect because the woman used deadly force, not in defense of her dwelling or real property, but in
defense of her personal property—namely, her car and her laptop.
Answer to Question 56.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), held that Congress lacks the constitutional
power to add to the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction.
Answer A is incorrect. Article I of the Constitution, not Article II, gives Congress, not the President, the power to “make

 

 Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.”
Answer C is incorrect. Congress’s Article I power to create military tribunals does not expand its power over the
Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction, which is set by Article III.
Answer D is incorrect for the same reason given in the explanation for answer B.
Answer to Question 57.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. This question specifies that the traditional common law rule of assumption of risk
applies. Under that rule, even if an actor causes injury to a victim, the victim is barred from recovering damages if the
injury results from the victim’s having knowingly and voluntarily chosen to encounter the risk of injury posed by the
actor’s conduct. The motorist was fully aware that there was risk posed by the blasting company’s activity and was
instructed to stop, yet chose to proceed, thus assuming the risk of damage to the car as a result of the blasting.
Answers A, B, and C are all incorrect, because the assumption-of-risk defense bars the motorist from recovering for the
damage to the car.
Answer to Question 58.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. In contracts for the sale of goods, unless otherwise agreed, the seller’s tender of
delivery is a condition to the buyer’s duty to accept and pay for goods, and the buyer’s tender of payment is a condition to
the seller’s duty to tender delivery. UCC §§ 2-507 & 2-511. Here both parties’ obligations were discharged, because
neither condition for performance was satisfied.
Answer B is incorrect. The buyer did not breach, because the buyer’s obligations were discharged as discussed above.
Answer C is incorrect. The broker did not breach, because the broker’s obligations were discharged, as discussed above.
Answer D is incorrect. The buyer’s manifestation of an intent to perform is irrelevant, since both the buyer’s and the
broker’s obligations were discharged, as discussed above.
Answer to Question 59.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. When a real estate contract does not mention which items will stay with the house,
the law of fixtures applies. A fixture is an item that has been attached to the land, is appropriate to be so attached, and is
intended to be part of the land. The garbage disposal and the ceiling fan qualify as fixtures. The power lawn mower is not
a fixture but is considered personal property, which may be removed.
Answer A is incorrect. The power lawn mower is an article of personal property, which may be removed. The garbage
disposal and ceiling fan are fixtures, which must remain with the house.
Answer B is incorrect. The garbage disposal and the ceiling fan are fixtures, which must remain with the house.
Answer C is incorrect. The ceiling fan is a fixture, which must remain with the house. The power lawn mower is
personal property, which may be removed.
Answer to Question 60.

 

 Explanation: Answer C is correct. The man is unavailable to testify due to his assertion of his Fifth Amendment
privilege. His statement to his fiancée was so contrary to his penal interest that one would not expect him to make it unless
it were true. Further, there is corroboration of his statement: the defendant paid him $10,000 and the man was seen
entering the restaurant shortly before the fire. Therefore, the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest
would make the man’s statement admissible. Further, because the man’s statement to his fiancée is nontestimonial, the
Sixth Amendment would not block its admission.
Answer A is incorrect. The man’s statement satisfies the hearsay exception for declarations against interest.
Answer B is incorrect. The man’s statement to his fiancée would not be considered testimonial. It was not made for the
primary purpose of assisting with a criminal investigation, and the man would have had no expectation that a statement to
a loved one would be so used. Because the Sixth Amendment does not control the admission of nontestimonial hearsay
statements, it would not block admission of the man’s statement.
Answer D is incorrect. The man’s statement could not be admitted through the coconspirator exception to the hearsay
rule. While there may be sufficient evidence that the defendant and the man were “coconspirators” and that the man’s
statement to his fiancée was made “during” that conspiracy (as required by FRE 801(d)(2)(E)), the man’s statement to his
fiancée in no way “furthered” the conspiracy as required by the coconspirator exception. The federal courts have held that
idle chatter by coconspirators does not further the conspiracy and therefore cannot fit within the exception. The man’s
comments to his fiancée about his feelings about the conspiracy did not advance the aims of his venture with the
defendant.
Answer to Question 61.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. As the state-law claim remains to be decided in the action, there is not yet a final
judgment on the merits of the entire action, and thus an appeal is not allowed under the final judgment rule.
Answer B is incorrect. There is supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim. Further, whether an appeal is proper
for the federal claim is not tied to jurisdiction over the state-law claim.
Answer C is incorrect. To obtain a discretionary interlocutory appeal, the party seeking to appeal must apply to both the
district and appellate courts to meet the statutory standards. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Because the scientist has appealed
without attempting to satisfy that requirement, the appeal cannot be treated as a discretionary interlocutory appeal.
Answer D is incorrect. Under the final judgment rule, a judgment is not final until all the claims in the action have been
resolved. While a party can ask the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), to certify a final judgment as to a
resolved claim when it is separate and distinct from the unresolved claims and then appeal that decision, in this particular
case, the court would reject such a request because the federal and state claims overlap.
Answer to Question 62.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The burning of the one-dollar bills was expressive conduct protected by the First
Amendment, because the speaker intended the burning to communicate a message, and in context, the audience was likely
to receive the message. The ordinance, however, does not violate the First Amendment because it is content-neutral and it
satisfies the elements of intermediate judicial scrutiny, which are stated correctly in Answer A.
Answer B is incorrect. It is true that the ordinance prohibits conduct, but on these facts, the burning of the one-dollar
bills was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, because the speaker intended the burning to communicate
a message, and in context, the audience was likely to receive the message. In this situation, the ordinance satisfies the First
Amendment not simply because it regulates conduct, but because it is content-neutral and it satisfies the elements of
intermediate judicial scrutiny.

 

 Answer C is incorrect. Notwithstanding the absence of a fire risk here, there is no indication on these facts that the
prosecution was a pretext for the government’s disapproval of the speaker’s message. The city has a legitimate interest in
enforcing the permit requirement generally because of the risks associated with open fires in public places.
Answer D is incorrect. The ordinance is not overbroad because a permit requirement for open fires in public places does
not restrict substantially more speech than the First Amendment allows to be restricted.
Answer to Question 63.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Negligently caused emotional distress is ordinarily not actionable unless connected to
a physical injury.
Answer A is incorrect. Negligence causing “pure” emotional distress is only actionable in limited circumstances, such as
when a defendant causes a plaintiff distress at the prospect of imminent physical injury (the “zone of danger”) or when a
certain kind of special relationship exists between the parties (e.g., therapist-patient). Courts have not deemed the
employment relationship to be “special” in the relevant sense, and therefore the dispatcher’s claim will fail because it does
not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no liability for negligence causing only emotional
distress, without physical injury.
Answer B is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher’s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the
existence of a duty. As noted earlier, courts generally do not recognize a duty to take care against causing emotional
distress unconnected to a physical injury.
Answer D is incorrect. The insufficiency in the dispatcher’s case is not as to breach of a duty but rather as to the
existence of a duty.
Answer to Question 64.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. Typically for a single offense, an attempt merges into the completed offense because
the intended target is the one who suffers the harm. However, there are two separate offenses here. The first is the
woman’s failed attempt to kill the husband, which resulted only in his injury; this is an attempted murder. The second is
causing the death of her son, which is a completed murder. Although the woman did not intend to harm her son, her intent
toward her husband can be transferred under the doctrine of transferred intent to hold her liable for the actual harm caused
to her son. The doctrines of mens rea and causation support liability for both the action the woman attempted and the
harm she caused to each victim. Consequently, a fact-finder could find her guilty of the son’s murder. The charges need
not be tried together; each is a separate and independent offense.
Answer B is incorrect because there is no constitutional requirement that the two offenses be charged together. The
attempt is not a lesser included offense of the murder; it is a separate charge with a separate victim and independent theory
of liability.
Answer C is incorrect because the two offenses each address a separate, and separately punishable, harm. The offenses
do not merge, nor do they constitutionally require concurrent sentencing.
Answer D is incorrect for the same reason as answer C: attempted murder does not merge as a lesser offense to murder
because the attempted murder and murder were separate acts that caused independent harm to independent victims.
Answer to Question 65.

 

 Explanation: Answer A is correct. The seller’s demand for a modification was a repudiation, because the seller said that
it would not perform if the buyer did not agree to the price increase. UCC § 2-611, cmt. 2. The remedy of a buyer of
goods for a seller’s breach includes cover by getting substitute goods. In that situation the buyer’s damages are the
difference between the cost of cover and the contract price together with incidental or consequential damages, less
expenses saved due to the breach. UCC § 2-712. Here the difference between the cost of cover and the contract price is
$3,000.
Answer B is incorrect. If the buyer had agreed to the modification and obtained the lumber from the seller, the buyer
would also have had to give up its claim for damages, so that transaction would not have been a reasonable substitute
purchase.
Answer C is incorrect. Even if the seller’s request for a modification was made in good faith, the buyer did not agree to
the modification and was free to reject the seller’s request for a modification.
Answer D is incorrect. The buyer did not have to mitigate by purchasing from the seller, since the seller’s offer was
conditioned on the buyer’s giving up any claim for damages against the seller.
Answer to Question 66.
Explanation: Answer A is correct because the location of the real estate determines which law to use in determining
whether the gift has lapsed. The cabin is real estate located in State A, and therefore State A’s law of lapse will be used.
Answer B is incorrect. The location of the testator’s domicile at the time of his death (State B) will be used in
determining the validity and construction of the will regarding all property located in that state, but it will not be used
regarding real estate located in another state (State A).
Answer C is incorrect. The nephew is the beneficiary under the man’s will, but the beneficiary’s place of domicile is
irrelevant to determining whether the bequest lapsed.
Answer D is incorrect. Which state has the most significant contacts is irrelevant. The location of the cabin (State A)
determines which law to use.
Answer to Question 67.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The manufacturer, at the time of entering into the contract with the distributor, falsely
stated to the distributor that it did not have a plan in place to cease providing products for sale in State A. This was an
intentional and material misrepresentation, made for the purpose of deceiving the distributor, on which misrepresentation
the distributor actually and reasonably relied to its detriment. As such, it supports a fraud claim by the distributor.
Answer A is incorrect. The distributor may sue for fraud regardless of whether the distributor also has a valid claim for
breach of contract.
Answer B is incorrect. The manufacturer affirmatively misrepresented a material fact when it falsely stated that it had no
plan in place to cease doing business in State A.
Answer D is incorrect. This answer points to a fact—the manufacturer’s reservation of a right to do business with other
distributors—that is irrelevant to the question of whether the manufacturer is subject to liability for fraud.
Answer to Question 68.

 

 Explanation: Answer A is correct. When a federal rule is valid and on point in a federal court action, it controls over a
conflicting state rule. The US Supreme Court has held that FRCP 23 is valid and that it, and not state law, controls
whether an action may proceed as a class action in federal court.
Answer B is incorrect. The court will apply a valid and on-point federal rule. No showing of a “substantial federal
interest” is needed.
Answer C is incorrect. The outcome-determinative test applies only when state law conflicts with a judge-made federal
practice. A valid and on-point federal rule will apply over a state rule in a federal action even if the differences in the two
rules would satisfy the outcome-determinative test.
Answer D is incorrect. The general premise of the Erie/Hanna Doctrine is that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will
apply in diversity cases, displacing the procedural rules of the state whose substantive law is being applied.
Answer to Question 69.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The deed in lieu of foreclosure does not extinguish the subsequent mortgage on the
property. A mortgagor’s later-executed mortgage generally can be extinguished only by foreclosure. Thus, the holder of
the senior lien (the seller) should have searched the title to determine if a junior lien existed and, if so, brought a
foreclosure action to extinguish it rather than accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
Answer A is incorrect. The status of the investor, the junior lienholder, is not affected by that lienholder’s failure to cure
the mortgagor’s default.
Answer B is incorrect. The general rule that a deed in lieu of foreclosure does not extinguish subsequent mortgages is
unaffected by whether the senior lien was a purchase money mortgage or not.
Answer D is incorrect. The reason for obtaining the junior mortgage is irrelevant. It is not extinguished by the deed in
lieu of foreclosure.
Answer to Question 70.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The ordinance is overbroad because prohibiting all First Amendment activities on the
beach restricts substantially more speech than the First Amendment allows to be restricted.
Answer A is incorrect. The ordinance does not create a prior restraint on speech. Prior restraints are injunctions or
administrative systems that prevent speech from occurring. The ordinance here is a mere prohibition of speech, penalizing
speech after it occurs.
Answer C is incorrect. A public beach is not a traditional public forum. The Supreme Court has limited such forums to
streets, sidewalks, and parks. Nor is there an indication on these facts that the city had dedicated the beach as a speech
forum.
Answer D is incorrect. These facts are not sufficient to prove that the city enacted the ordinance because officials
disapproved of the message of the protesters. The facts indicate that swimmers were unable to use the beach for several
days because of the demonstrations. The concern for swimmers is a content-neutral interest that would permit the city to
regulate demonstrations at the beach more narrowly.
Answer to Question 71.

 

 Explanation: Answer B is correct because the cruel and unusual punishment clause, as held in Atkins v. Virginia, 536
U.S. 304 (2002), prohibits imposition of the death penalty on a person with a severe intellectual disability. Atkins
suggested that an IQ of 70 is an appropriate threshold, although Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. 701 (2014), later clarified that
borderline cases require individualized determination. Here, the IQ of 60 clearly indicates a qualifying intellectual
disability that precludes execution.
Answer A is incorrect because, although the disparity may seem unjust, the cruel and unusual punishment clause does
not contain a proportionality principle limiting the relative sentences that accomplices may receive.
Answer C is incorrect because the cruel and unusual punishment clause does not categorically preclude the death penalty
for persons found guilty of felony murder, even when the defendant was not the person who directly took life.
Answer D is incorrect because the state may not execute a severely intellectually disabled person.
Answer to Question 72.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. According to the rule of divisible contract, when performance under a contract can be
divided into multiple tasks, each with a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed, one
party’s performance of a task triggers the other party’s duty to pay for it, even when the performing party breaches
another part of the contract. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 240.
Answer A is incorrect. When it is applicable, as here, the rule of divisible contract provides a way to fairly compensate a
party who has materially breached a contract.
Answers B and C are incorrect. As discussed above, when a breaching party can recover under the rule of divisible
contract, it is not necessary to look to restitution to provide a remedy.
Answer to Question 73.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. The woman’s out-of-court statement would be hearsay if offered to prove that the
defendant, in fact, did not run the red light, and there is no applicable hearsay exception. Further, extrinsic evidence of the
woman’s prior inconsistent statement may not be offered to impeach her, because she had no opportunity at trial to
explain or deny the earlier statement.
Answer A is incorrect. The woman’s out-of-court statement would be hearsay if offered to prove that the defendant, in
fact, did not run the red light, and there is no applicable hearsay exception. This answer is also incorrect because extrinsic
evidence of the woman’s prior inconsistent statement may not be offered to impeach her, because she had no opportunity
at trial to explain or deny the earlier statement.
Answer B is incorrect. The woman’s out-of-court statement would be hearsay if offered to prove that the defendant, in
fact, did not run the red light, and there is no applicable hearsay exception.
Answer C is incorrect. Extrinsic evidence of the woman’s prior inconsistent statement may not be offered to impeach
her, because she had no opportunity at trial to explain or deny the earlier statement.
Answer to Question 74.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. This question asks which argument would be LEAST effective for the manufacturer’s
defense against liability. The learned intermediary doctrine—which insulates manufacturers of prescription drugs from
liability if they provide adequate warnings to prescribing physicians—has no application in this case, which involves the

 

 sale and use of an over-the-counter medication. Accordingly, the doctrine would offer no help to the manufacturer in its
defense of the action.
Answer A is incorrect. The incidence of injury being very rare would be a helpful argument for the manufacturer, as it
would help to establish that the medication was not defective as a result of the manufacturer’s failure to list the coating’s
ingredients or to otherwise warn of the risk of allergic reaction. (If the risk of a certain type of injury is low enough, there
is no duty to warn.)
Answer C is incorrect. The manufacturer can argue that its failure to warn was not a proximate cause of the daughter’s
injury because the mother’s administration of a triple dose to the daughter was an unforeseeable intervening (superseding)
cause. The argument may not win, but it is plausible and thus would be a better ground for avoiding liability than the
learned intermediary rule, which would be ineffective as a defense.
Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons that answer C is incorrect. Given the mother’s knowledge of the daughter’s
allergy, the mother’s failure to determine whether the medication contained the substance to which the daughter was
allergic might provide the basis for a no-proximate-cause argument.
Answer to Question 75.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(e), a final pretrial order may be amended
only to prevent manifest injustice.
Answer A is incorrect. Under Rule 16(e), a final pretrial order may be amended only to prevent manifest injustice. The
“if justice so requires” standard, generally associated with pretrial amendments under Rule 15(a), does not apply in this
setting.
Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 16(e), a final pretrial order may be amended only to prevent manifest injustice. The
language cited in this answer comes from Rule 60(b), which governs motions seeking relief from a judgment.
Answer C is incorrect. Under Rule 16(e), a final pretrial order may be amended only to prevent manifest injustice. While
“good cause” is the standard for amending a pretrial order under Rule 16(b), the higher “manifest injustice” standard
applies once the court enters the final pretrial order under Rule 16(e).
Answer to Question 76.
Explanation: Answer A is correct because a jury’s conviction on a lesser charge constitutes an implied acquittal of a
greater charge, thus barring retrial on that greater charge.
Answer B is incorrect. Although vindictive-prosecution doctrines do preclude a prosecutor from retaliating for a
successful defense appeal, here the prosecutor would be simply retrying the original charge. The problem is not that the
prosecutor would be enhancing the charges; it is that the jury has already acquitted the defendant of the primary count.
Answer C is incorrect because the defendant’s request for the instruction on the lesser included offense does not operate
to nullify the jury’s implied not-guilty verdict on the greater offense.
Answer D is incorrect because, by convicting the defendant only on the lesser count, the jury impliedly acquitted on the
greater count.
Answer to Question 77.

 

 Explanation: Answer C is correct. The meaning of a term supplied by usage of trade will be observed with respect to a
transaction between members of the trade, even if one of the parties is not aware of the usage.
Answer A is incorrect. The contract will be performed according to the meaning supplied by the usage of trade.
Answer B is incorrect. The interpretive rule contra proferentem (construe a term’s meaning against the party who drafted
the writing in which the term is used) may be applied where there is an ambiguity, but there is no ambiguity when the
meaning is supplied by trade usage.
Answer D is incorrect. The rule of misunderstanding applies when each party attaches a different reasonable meaning to
a term, but here the reasonable meaning is supplied by trade usage.
Answer to Question 78.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The denial of the permit was a content-based restriction on expression because it was
based on the content of the videos, which city officials found to be disturbing. Content-based restrictions on expression in
a traditional public forum receive strict judicial scrutiny, the elements of which Answer B correctly states.
Answer A is incorrect. It states the incorrect standard of review for the city’s denial of the permit. More than an
“important government interest” is required. The denial of the permit was a content-based restriction on expression in a
traditional public forum because it was based on the content of the videos, which city officials found to be disturbing.
Content-based restrictions on expression in a traditional public forum receive strict judicial scrutiny, which requires the
city to prove that its denial of the permit was necessary to serve a compelling government interest.
Answer C is incorrect. It states the incorrect standard of review for the city’s denial of the permit. The existence of
alternative opportunities would only be relevant in a case involving a content-neutral restriction on speech. But the denial
of the permit was a content-based restriction on expression in a traditional public forum because it was based on the
content of the videos, which city officials found to be disturbing. Content-based restrictions on expression in a traditional
public forum receive strict judicial scrutiny, which requires the city to prove that its denial of the permit was necessary to
serve a compelling government interest.
Answer D is incorrect. It states the incorrect standard of review for the city’s denial of the permit. Whether speech is
patently offensive is relevant only in obscenity cases, which involve expression relating to sex.
Answer to Question 79.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. In this case, the only harm suffered by the farmer was lost revenue, and strict
products liability does not apply when a defective product causes only economic loss, as opposed to personal injury or
property damage.
Answer B is incorrect. The problem is not the manufacturer’s lack of knowledge about the farmer’s contracts but the rule
that prevents an injured party from recovering for purely economic loss caused by a defective product.
Answer C is incorrect. The statement is true, but it does not entitle the farmer to damages. The contract law rule of
consequential damages is irrelevant to the resolution of a tort claim.
Answer D is incorrect. Because the farmer has suffered only economic loss, he cannot recover on a strict products
liability theory.
Answer to Question 80.

 

 Explanation: Answer A is correct. This evidence is inadmissible under FRE 404(b). It is evidence of an uncharged
crime (possession of cocaine) offered to show that the defendant is a bad person and is therefore more likely to have
manufactured methamphetamine. The evidence may not be admitted for that purpose.
Answer B is incorrect. Under FRE 404(b), a conviction is not a prerequisite to the admissibility of other crimes evidence.
The testimony, however, is nonetheless inadmissible as improper character evidence.
Answer C is incorrect. Under FRE 404(b), evidence of some uncharged crimes may be admitted to show intent, but the
defendant’s personal use of cocaine in college sheds no light on his intent to distribute methamphetamine years later.
Answer D is incorrect. Under FRE 404(b), evidence of some uncharged crimes may be admitted to show knowledge, but
the defendant’s personal use of cocaine in college sheds no light on his knowledge that the substance he was allegedly
manufacturing was methamphetamine or that such conduct was illegal.
Answer to Question 81.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. A title insurance policy is a contract of indemnity and insures the named insured in
the policy and his heirs and devisees so long as the named insured or his heirs or devisees own the insured property. Here,
the house passed to the buyer’s son under the buyer’s will, and the son owned the house/property when the holder of the
superior title brought the suit.
Answer A is incorrect. The son is insured because he was the devisee of the house under the buyer’s will. It is irrelevant
that the son is not a named insured.
Answer B is incorrect. A title policy protects whoever is the named insured (and heirs or devisees), whether that person
is the buyer or the mortgagee. Here the buyer was the named insured.
Answer D is incorrect. The only person who is protected by the policy is the named insured (and heirs or devisees). It is
irrelevant who paid the policy premium.
Answer to Question 82.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, a court may grant judgment as a matter of
law against a party only if the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to
find for that party.
Answer A is incorrect. A preponderance standard involves weighing the evidence, and courts cannot weigh the evidence
when ruling on a Rule 50 motion.
Answer B is incorrect. Courts cannot weigh the evidence when ruling on a Rule 50 motion.
Answer C is incorrect. Under Rule 50, a court may grant judgment as a matter of law against a party only if the court
finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for that party. A mere scintilla of
evidence would be insufficient under this standard.
Answer to Question 83.
Explanation: Answer D is correct because a reasonable jury could find that the defendant was twice kicked in the groin
by the victim prior to the homicide, and on that basis could conclude that the defendant had adequate provocation. Even

 
 
though it is a single witness who recounts this event, a jury can credit a single witness’s testimony.
Answer A is incorrect because the state offered evidence of a serious battery on the defendant, which can constitute an
adequate provocation, no matter which party presented the evidence.
Answer B is incorrect because the judge’s job is not to weigh the evidence but is only to determine whether a reasonable
jury could find adequate provocation. The jury may permissibly credit one single witness’s account, even when that
account contradicts ample other evidence.
Answer C is incorrect because there is no general rule that the defense is entitled to an instruction on any theory of the
case; the defense is only entitled to instructions for which there is a factual and legal basis. For instance, if there were no
evidence of provocation, but the defense sought a manslaughter instruction, such an instruction should be denied.
Answer to Question 84.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The bank is an intended beneficiary of the contract between the carpenter and the
homeowner. An intended beneficiary can enforce a contract to which it is not a party, because the parties intended the
contract to benefit that beneficiary. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 302. However, one party to the contract can
assert, against the beneficiary, claims for breach by the other party to the contract. Here, the homeowner, as promisee of
the carpenter’s promise to perform the work, can assert the $2,000 claim for breach of that promise against the bank.
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 309(2).
Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, the homeowner, as promisee of the carpenter’s promise to do the work, can
assert the $2,000 claim for damages against the bank, as an intended beneficiary.
Answer C is incorrect. The bank is not an incidental beneficiary. Instead the bank is an intended beneficiary that can
enforce a contract to which it is not a party because the parties intended the contract to benefit that beneficiary.
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 302.
Answer D is incorrect. As an intended beneficiary, the bank can assert the carpenter’s rights under the contract. Here, the
carpenter’s breach was not material, so the homeowner’s obligation was not discharged. And even if the carpenter’s
breach was material, the bank could recover the value of the work done for the homeowner as restitution. Restatement
(Second) of Contracts § 374.
Answer to Question 85.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. The exception to the hearsay rule for statements against interest may be used to admit
evidence only after a showing that the declarant is unavailable to testify. Because the brother is available, that particular
hearsay exception may not be used.
Answer B is incorrect. The hearsay exception for statements against interest may be used in civil or criminal cases.
Answer C is incorrect. The statement is inadmissible due to the brother’s availability to testify. Although the statement is
clearly against the brother’s criminal interest, that is not a sufficient condition for admissibility. Unavailability of the
brother, as the declarant, also needs to be established.
Answer D is incorrect. The statement is inadmissible due to the brother’s availability to testify. Even if the employer
could show corroboration, the statement would not be admissible through the hearsay exception for statements against
interest.

 

 Answer to Question 86.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. The Supreme Court has held that government-imposed conditions on the
development of a property constitute a taking unless the conditions are rationally related to preventing harms caused by
the new development. Because the condition of making the swimming pool available to neighborhood residents is not
rationally related to alleviating the harm of increased street traffic, the condition constitutes a government taking. The city
does not propose to provide just compensation for the taking, and therefore the condition is unconstitutional.
Answer A is incorrect. Requiring the pool to be open to all neighborhood residents does not violate the current tenants’
freedom of expressive association, because their association with one another is not for the advancement of free
expression. Nor does the requirement violate freedom of intimate association, because their association is not small and
intimate.
Answer C is incorrect. Whether or not the condition undermines the owner’s reasonable investment-backed expectations
is not the proper standard. Because the government is demanding public access to the property in exchange for a permit to
build, the test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally related to preventing
harms caused by the new development.
Answer D is incorrect. Whether or not the condition substantially advances a legitimate interest of the city is not the
proper standard. The proper test for determining whether the condition constitutes a taking is whether it is rationally
related to preventing harms caused by the new development.
Answer to Question 87.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. A party that materially breaches a contract is nevertheless entitled to recover under a
theory of restitution the amount of the value of the benefit that the breaching party’s part performance conferred on the
victim of the breach. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 374.
Answer A is incorrect. A breaching party cannot recover on a theory of reliance.
Answer B is incorrect. This is not a divisible contract in which performance can be divided into multiple tasks, each with
a corresponding price that the other party must pay when the task is completed. Instead it is a typical construction contract
with progress payments as elements of the job are completed. Thus, the contractor does not have a right to $60,000 for
having laid the foundation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 240.
Answer D is incorrect. Contract law generally does not distinguish between willful breaches and other breaches.
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 374; Farnsworth, Contracts § 12.3. This situation would not require a court to
consider the reason for breach.
Answer to Question 88.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. An area variance may be granted when the owner suffers a hardship as the land is
currently zoned and the variance will protect the public interest. The man purchased a three-acre tract of land knowing
that the applicable zoning law required any home to be surrounded by least two acres of vacant land. The man created the
hardship by building the home on his land in a location that left an insufficient amount of land to satisfy the zoning law if
he built a second home. The man cannot take advantage of the hardship he created.
Answer A is incorrect. The fact that the land is used for residential purposes is irrelevant. An area variance may be
granted in the residential setting but not when the hardship is self-created.
Answer C is incorrect. The fact that the deed contained a covenant noting that the land can be used only for residential

 
 
purposes is irrelevant. The applicable zoning law allows residential use but limits it by the amount of vacant land
surrounding any home.
Answer D is incorrect. The owner’s personal hardship is irrelevant. An area variance can be granted if the owner suffers
a hardship, but he cannot take advantage of the hardship he created.
Answer to Question 89.
Explanation: Answer C is correct because the prosecution has a constitutional obligation to turn over material
exculpatory evidence, which includes evidence that would impeach a critical government witness. Here, the government’s
key witness had a conviction for an offense—perjury—that directly related to the witness’s credibility. If the failure to
disclose that information created a reasonable probability of a different outcome, then the appellate court should reverse
the conviction.
Answer A is incorrect because, although generally discovery is governed by state rules, the due process clause contains
some core rights, such as the right to disclosure of critical exculpatory evidence.
Answer B is incorrect because the scope of due process is not limited to proof of actual innocence. The government must
disclose any evidence favorable to the defendant that could affect the outcome of the case.
Answer D is incorrect because the due process clause requires disclosure only if the evidence is significant enough to
affect the outcome. If the appellate court concludes that the outcome would not have been affected by disclosure of the
witness’s prior conviction, then there is no basis for reversal.
Answer to Question 90.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. Extrinsic evidence of the girlfriend’s earlier statement may be admitted for the
purpose of impeaching her direct testimony that the defendant was at home with her during the entire morning, since she
was given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. The statement is admissible for impeachment purposes only,
though, because it would be hearsay not within any exception if offered to prove the truth of the statement concerning the
time the defendant left home.
Answer A is incorrect. FRE 613(b) permits proof of a witness’s prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence
so long as the witness has an opportunity to explain or deny the statement. Here, the girlfriend had that opportunity and
denied the statement, making proof of the statement by extrinsic evidence permissible.
Answer B is incorrect. While the girlfriend’s prior inconsistent statement is inadmissible hearsay if offered for its truth, it
may be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of impeaching the girlfriend.
Answer D is incorrect. The girlfriend’s prior inconsistent statement is admissible only for impeachment purposes. If
offered to prove the truth of the statement concerning the time the defendant left home, it would be inadmissible hearsay
not within any exception.
Answer to Question 91.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. A real estate broker has a duty to make full disclosure of any interest the broker or a
family member of the broker may have in the purchase of the property. The broker had a duty to disclose that the
purchaser was a family member. Failure to make this disclosure breaches a fiduciary duty and results in the broker’s
losing the commission.

 

 Answer A is incorrect. The broker failed to disclose that the purchaser was a family member and that she was going to
make a profit from the resale of the building.
Answer B is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the daughter agreed to purchase the building at the full listing price. A broker
has a fiduciary duty to disclose any interest the broker or a family member of the broker may have in the purchase of the
property.
Answer D is incorrect. The commission is paid by the seller who signed the listing agreement with the broker. The
daughter did not sign the listing agreement and was not liable for the commission.
Answer to Question 92.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. A rule of products liability law states that there is no recovery if a defect in a product
causes damage only to the product itself (as opposed to personal injury, or injury to other property). This rule is
sometimes referred to as the “economic loss rule.” In such cases, the owner of the damaged product is limited to contract
remedies.
Answer B is incorrect. The absence of negligence on the part of the manufacturer does not provide a basis for denying
recovery to the couple on a strict products liability claim.
Answer C is incorrect. Recovery on a strict products liability claim does not depend on whether the evidence supports an
inference of manufacturer negligence.
Answer D is incorrect for the reasons stated in the explanation for answer A.
Answer to Question 93.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. A motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1) must be made within one
year from the entry of judgment. The employee’s motion was untimely because it was made 15 months after entry of
judgment.
Answer A is incorrect. In appropriate circumstances, a court may grant relief under Rule 60(b)(1) for “mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”
Answer C is incorrect. The court should deny the motion because it was filed more than one year after entry of
judgment.
Answer D is incorrect. The court should deny the motion because it was filed more than one year after entry of
judgment. The one-year limit applies even if the party moves promptly after learning of the mistake for which relief
would be sought.
Answer to Question 94.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Acceleration clauses are valid and can be triggered solely by nonpayment of the
mortgage debt but also by other conditions in the mortgage. Here, the breached condition was waste, which occurred
when the man tore down the one warehouse without the bank’s permission.
Answer A is incorrect. Courts generally do not imply conditions that could constitute a default. Here the court is merely
recognizing the contract between the man and the bank.

 

 Answer C is incorrect. Acceleration clauses can be triggered by conditions not directly related to the mortgage debt, such
as by waste.
Answer D is incorrect. It is irrelevant that the man’s actions improved the value of the property. The bank’s security
interest attached to the land and two warehouses as they existed when the mortgage was signed.
Answer to Question 95.
Explanation: Answer D is correct. Because the dealership’s duty of care was delegable, because the dealership was not
negligent in hiring the EMS firm, and because the EMT was not an employee of the dealership, there is no basis for
holding the dealership liable, whether directly or vicariously.
Answer A is incorrect. The EMS firm was an independent contractor, not an employee of the dealership, so there can be
no vicarious liability, and we know that the dealership exercised due care in selecting the EMS firm, so therefore there is
also no basis for direct liability.
Answer B is incorrect. The duty to provide competent medical care was properly delegated to the EMS firm.
Answer C is incorrect. Because the EMT was an employee only of the EMS firm, not the dealership, any carelessness by
the EMT could be imputed only to the EMS firm.
Answer to Question 96.
Explanation: Answer D is correct because, under the “plain error” rule, an appellate court may remedy an error that was
plain or obvious if that error affected substantial rights. Here, the error was obvious, of constitutional dimension, and
likely prejudicial. Consequently, the court of appeals has authority to reverse the conviction.
Answer A is incorrect because, although a defendant’s failure to object can change the standard of appellate review, it
does not foreclose review.
Answer B is incorrect because the plain-error rule allows an appellate court to remedy serious and obvious errors on
direct appeal. For such errors, the defendant is not required to claim or prove ineffective assistance of counsel.
Answer C is incorrect because a defendant is, in a sense, “penalized” by an attorney’s failure to object. Because the
attorney did not object, the defendant must now meet the stringent requirements of the plain-error standard. Had the error
been preserved by a contemporaneous objection, the standard of review would be more favorable to the defendant.
Answer to Question 97.
Explanation: Answer A is correct. If a buyer repudiates a contract for unfinished goods, the seller may in the exercise of
reasonable commercial judgment proceed in any reasonable manner, including finishing the goods for resale. UCC § 2-
704(2). The seller’s damages in that situation are the difference between the contract price and the resale price. UCC § 2-
706(1). Here that amount is $8,000.
Answer B is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the
goods for resale.
Answer C is incorrect. As discussed above, after repudiation by a buyer, the seller has the alternative of finishing the
goods for resale rather than seeking costs and lost profit. Note that this has the effect of reducing the seller’s damages.

 

 Answer D is incorrect. In the common law case of Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co., 35 F.2d 301 (4th Cir. 1929),
the court held that the seller had a duty not to complete a bridge after the buyer repudiated. But UCC Article Two has a
different rule, because unlike a completed bridge, completed goods can be resold to avoid or reduce loss.
Answer to Question 98.
Explanation: Answer C is correct. The first part of the psychiatrist’s proposed testimony is admissible, but the second
part—that the defendant was legally insane—is inadmissible. Under FRE 704(b), an expert in a criminal case may not
state an opinion about whether a defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. Such testimony is
inadmissible because it is an opinion about whether the defendant had a mental state that constitutes a defense.
Answer A is incorrect. As explained above, under FRE 704(b), an expert in a criminal case may not state an opinion
about whether a defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. Thus, the first part of the psychiatrist’s
proposed testimony is admissible, as it will be helpful to the jury, but the second part is not.
Answer B is incorrect. FRE 704(b)’s prohibition on expert testimony about a defendant’s mental state applies to both
parties’ experts in a criminal case.
Answer D is incorrect. An expert may testify that a defendant suffered from schizophrenia but may not testify that the
defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. The latter testimony is barred by FRE 704(b).
Answer to Question 99.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. Although the Supreme Court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct
protected by the First Amendment, the Court nevertheless has upheld bans on nude dancing in particular and public nudity
more generally. The ordinance here is a content-neutral prohibition because it does not target any message conveyed by
public nudity.
Answer A is incorrect. Demonstrating in the city park, which is a traditional public forum, is expressive conduct
protected by the First Amendment. In addition, the Supreme Court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct
protected by the First Amendment. However, the ordinance here is a content-neutral prohibition because it does not target
any message conveyed by public nudity.
Answer C is incorrect. While it is true that the city park is a public forum, the ordinance prohibiting public nudity is a
valid restriction on the use of the park by demonstrators. The ordinance here is a content-neutral prohibition.
Answer D is incorrect. Although the Supreme Court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct protected by the
First Amendment, the Court nevertheless has held that cities may ban nude dancing in particular and public nudity more
generally. The ordinance here is a content-neutral prohibition because it does not target any message conveyed by public
nudity.
Answer to Question 100.
Explanation: Answer B is correct. While the daughter did not own the fee when she purported to convey the fee to the
purchaser, the purchaser subsequently acquired the fee when, after the daughter conveyed to the purchaser, the son
conveyed his remainder interest to the daughter. This is due to the doctrine of “estoppel by deed” or “after-acquired
property.” Under this doctrine, the portion of the title the daughter did not own when she purported to convey a fee simple
to the purchaser (the son’s remainder interest) automatically passed through to the purchaser when the daughter acquired
it from the son.

 

 Answer A is incorrect. The daughter did not intend or purport to convey a life estate pur autre vie to the purchaser; rather
she purported to convey a fee. And, even if a life estate were conveyed, the husband would have no claim because the
daughter’s life estate (and the purchaser’s life estate pur autre vie) would have terminated at the daughter’s death.
Answer C is incorrect. Here again, the daughter did not purport to convey a life estate to the purchaser and even if she
had, it would have terminated at her death.
Answer D is incorrect. Remainder interests are alienable.
