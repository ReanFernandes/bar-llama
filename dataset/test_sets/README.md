The test sets labelled `test_sets` are the ones put together from the older ( pre-2015) bar exam questions. Thus they dont contain Civil Procedure questions. 
Bar_test_set contains actual bar exam questions that were sourced from the 2022 bar exam. For all work, this is the definitive test set and the others can be considered as validation sets
