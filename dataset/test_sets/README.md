The test sets labelled `test_sets` are the ones put together from the older ( pre-2015) bar exam questions. Thus they dont contain Civil Procedure questions. 
These sets were originally used for validation, and to see if fine-tuning leads to better performance. We use these as a placeholder for the actual bar exam, so that results may be verified for the performance improvement without the need for licensing the actual test set.
