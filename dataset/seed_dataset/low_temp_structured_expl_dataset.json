The statute makes it a misdemeanor to \"knowingly fail to file\" such a report. The defendant, who is licensed to sell prescription drugs, sold $63,000 worth of prescription drugs during 2006 but did not file the report. Charged with the misdemeanor, the defendant testifies that he did a very poor job of keeping records and did not realize that his sales of prescription drugs had exceeded $50,000. If the jury believes the defendant, he should be found",

On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found",

When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.",

In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.",

In this scenario, the force (slap) was not directly related to the taking of the wallet, and thus the nexus requirement is not met.",

        "question": "  Acting on an anonymous telephone call, police went to the defendant's apartment, knocked on the door, and demanded to search it for narcotics. When the defendant refused, the police forced the door open and placed him under arrest. As they were removing him from the apartment, the defendant offered to give the officers \"valuable information\" in exchange for his release. Before he could say anything else, the defendant was given Miranda warnings by the police. Thereafter he told the police that he had stored some heroin in his friend's apartment and that he and his friend had been going to sell it. The heroin was recovered, and the defendant was prosecuted for conspiracy to sell narcotics and for possession of narcotics. At his trial, the defendant moved to suppress his statements. Which of the following is the defendant's best argument in support of the motion to suppress?",

One night, just before the store's closing time, he drove to the store, opened the front door and entered.

Fearing a hold up, the shopkeeper produced a gun from under the counter, pointed it at the man, and yelled, \"Stop!\" The man ran to the door and the toy gun fell from his pocket. The shopkeeper fired. The shot missed the man, but struck and killed a passerby outside the store.

After the brother had sold him the liquor, the buyer revealed his identity. The brother grabbed one of the rifles that the brothers kept handy in case of trouble with the law, and shot and wounded the buyer. Other officers, hiding nearby, overpowered and arrested the brother who had shot the buyer. Shortly thereafter, the second brother came on the scene. The officers in hiding had been waiting for him. One of them approached him and asked to buy liquor. The second brother was suspicious and refused to sell. The officers nevertheless arrested him.

        "question": "  Police received information from an undercover police officer that she had just seen two men (whom she described) in a red pickup truck selling marijuana to schoolchildren near the city's largest high school. A few minutes later, two police officers saw a pickup truck fitting the description a half block from the high school. The driver of the truck matched the description of one of the men described by the undercover officer. The only passenger was a young woman who was in the back of the truck. The police saw her get out and stand at a nearby bus stop. They stopped the truck and searched the driver. In the pocket of the driver's jacket, the police found a small bottle of pills that they recognized as narcotics. They then broke open a locked toolbox attached to the flatbed of the truck and found a small sealed envelope inside. They opened it and found marijuana. They also found a quantity of cocaine in the glove compartment. After completing their search of the driver and the truck, the police went over to the young woman and searched her purse. In her purse, they found a small quantity of heroin. Both the driver and the young woman were arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. If the young woman moves to suppress the use as evidence of the heroin, the court should",

In this case, the passenger did not match the description of the suspects and was not arrested until after the search of the truck. The police had no probable cause to search her purse, and the search was not incident to her arrest.",

The young woman refused, saying she no longer wanted to be part of the group. The leader, with the approval of the other members, told the young woman that she had become too involved with the gang to quit and that they would kill her if she did not accomplish the murder. The next day the young woman shot a member of a rival gang to death while the rival gang member was sitting on his motorcycle outside a restaurant. The young woman is charged with first-degree murder. First-degree murder is defined in the jurisdiction as the intentional premeditated killing of another.

The fuse failed to ignite and the building was not harmed.Arson is defined in this jurisdiction as \"the intentional burning of any building or structure of another, without the consent of the owner.\" The warehouse owner believed, however, that burning one's own building was arson, having been so advised by his lawyer.

The man tried to convince her to have intercourse with him but after ten minutes of her sustained refusals, the man left the apartment. Unknown to the man, the girl was 15 years old. Because she appeared to be older, the man believed her to be about 18 years old.

Much to his surprise, he noticed that the area beyond a clearing contained several newly constructed houses that had not been there before. Between the houses there was a small playground where several children were playing. Nevertheless, the marksman nailed a paper target to a tree and went to a point where the tree was between himself and the playground. He then fired several shots at the target.

The evidence showed that the bartender worked in a tavern and sold a bottle of beer to a person who was 17 years old and that the bartender did not ask for or see the purchaser's driver's license or any other identification.

A statute in the jurisdiction requires all day-care workers to report to the police cases where there is probable cause to suspect child abuse and provides for immediate removal from the home of any suspected child abuse victims. The employee was not aware of this statute. Nevertheless, he did report the child's condition to his supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day-care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent. About two weeks after the the employee first noticed the child's condition, the child was beaten to death by his father. The employee has been charged with murder in the death of the child. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the child had been the victim of beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that the employee had seen. The child's mother had been aware of the beatings but had not stopped them because she was herself afraid of the child's father. The employee's best argument that he is NOT guilty of murder is",

At his trial, he testified that he only sold the drugs to the agent, whom the defendant knew as \"Speedy,\" because Speedy had told him that he (Speedy) would be killed by fellow gang members unless he supplied them with cocaine. The prosecution did not cross-examine the defendant. As rebuttal evidence, however, the prosecutor introduced records, over the defendant's objection, showing that he had two prior convictions for narcotics-related offenses. The court instructed the jury concerning the defense of entrapment and added, also over the defendant's objection but in accord with state law, that it should acquit on the ground of entrapment only if it found that the defendant had established the elements of the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The defendant was convicted. On appeal, the defendant's conviction should be",

A deputy tackled him just as he entered the barn. As the rival attempted to get up, the deputy pinned his arms behind his back. Another deputy threatened, \"Tell us what you did with the marijuana farmer or we will shut you down and see your family on relief.\" The rival responded that he had killed the marijuana farmer in a fight but did not report the incident because he did not want authorities to enter his land and discover his marijuana crop.

        "question": "  A husband and wife took their 12-year-old son to a political rally to hear a controversial United States senator speak. The speaker was late, and the wife stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. While there, she saw a man placing what she believed to be a bomb against a wall at the back of the building. She went back inside and told her husband what she had seen. Without alerting anyone, they took their son and left. Some 20 minutes later, the bomb exploded, killing eight persons and injuring 50. In the jurisdiction, murder in the first degree is defined as an intentional homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation; murder in the second degree is defined as all other murder at common law; and manslaughter is defined as either a homicide in the heat of passion arising from adequate provocation or a homicide caused by gross negligence or reckless indifference to consequence. As to the deaths of the eight persons, what crime, if any, did the wife commit?",

            "Rule_Application": "In this jurisdiction, there is no legal duty to rescue or warn others in a life-threatening situation, unless there is a special relationship or a statutory duty. In this case, there is no such relationship or duty, so the wife did not have a legal obligation to act.",

She knew where the neighbor kept the necklace because she had been in the neighbor's house on many occasions when the neighbor had taken off the necklace and put it away in a jewelry box in the bathroom. One night, the woman went to the neighbor's house. The neighbor was away, and the house was dark. The woman opened the bathroom window, saw the jewelry box on the counter, and started to climb inside. As her leg cleared the window sill, the neighbor's cat let out a loud screech.

One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the license number of the driver's car. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her and the car, and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat of the car. Later it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding.

        "question": "  A woman who is a computer whiz decided to dedicate herself to exposing persons who traffic in child pornography. She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Deny it as to all photographs.",

            "Fact_Analysis": "The woman, a private individual, initially entered the defendant's computer and copied a file without government involvement. However, the second entry was prompted by a federal agent's offer of a monetary reward, which raises questions about government agency and Fourth Amendment implications.",
            "Rule_Application": "A private search does not trigger Fourth Amendment protections. However, if a private individual is acting as a government agent, their actions may be subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny. In this case, the woman's second entry into the defendant's computer, prompted by the federal agent's offer, may be considered a government-sponsored search, violating the Fourth Amendment.",

Deliberation is defined as \"cool reflection for any length of time, no matter how brief.\" The defendant, despondent and angry over losing his job, was contemplating suicide. He took his revolver, went to a bar, and drank until he was very intoxicated. A customer on the next stool was telling the bartender how it was necessary for companies to downsize and become more efficient in order to keep the economy strong. The defendant turned to him and said, \"Why don't you shut the hell up.\" The customer responded, \"This is a free country and I can say what I want,\" all the while shaking his finger at the defendant.

I've got a gun.\" After all the men in the lineup spoke those words, the teller identified the defendant as the robber. The defendant subsequently moved to suppress the testimony of the teller, claiming the lineup violated his privilege against self-incrimination. At a suppression hearing, the teller testified that she had not gotten a good look at the robber's face, because the robber had been wearing a hat pulled down over most of his face, but that she was certain the defendant was the robber because she had recognized his voice at the lineup. Should the defendant's motion be granted?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because being required to speak at the lineup, while compelled, was not testimonial or communicative.",

The defendant's utterance of the words was a non-testimonial act, as it did not convey any information about his thoughts or beliefs.",

A warrantless search is presumed unreasonable unless it falls under an exception, such as consent or exigent circumstances.

The friend agreed but made the woman promise not to hurt anyone during the robbery. The woman then drove to a sporting goods store, where she explained to the store owner that she needed a small firearm for use in a bank robbery. The store owner responded that he would charge extra because the woman was so unwise as to confide her unlawful plans for using the weapon, and he sold her a handgun at four times the regular price. During the robbery, the woman used the gun to threaten a bank teller into handing over the money. The gun discharged by accident and killed a bank customer.

At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property.

In the dark, she knew that she was taking some items that were not hers; she planned to sort these out later and return them. Upon arriving home, she found that she had taken a record book and some financial papers that belonged to the firm.

The executive did not intend to commit a felony when she entered the building, but rather to retrieve her personal possessions.

All other murder is second-degree murder, and manslaughter is defined as at common law. An employee was angry with her boss for denying her a raise. Intending to cause her boss discomfort, the employee secretly dropped into his coffee three over-the-counter laxative pills. The boss drank the coffee containing the pills. Although the pills would not have been dangerous to an ordinary person, because the boss was already taking other medication, he suffered a seizure and died.

An agent decided to enter the man's house while he was not at home and see what he could find. The agent discovered an envelope containing $5,000 in cash and an executive's business card. Returning the envelope to its place, the agent located and interviewed the executive, who admitted that he had paid the man $5,000 to settle a gambling debt; the executive also disclosed that the man regularly took illegal bets from the executive and several of his acquaintances. The agent then interviewed the acquaintances, who confirmed what the executive had told him. The agent then arranged to be introduced to the man at a local bar. After a few drinks, the man, unaware of the agent's identity, boasted that he was one of the biggest bookmakers in the state. The agent testified to all of his investigation's discoveries before a grand jury, which returned an indictment against the man for illegal gambling activities, based solely on the agent's testimony.

During jury selection, the trial court, over the defendant's objection, granted the prosecution's for-cause challenge of five prospective jurors who indicated upon questioning by both parties that they personally were opposed to the death penalty and were unsure if they could ever vote to impose it. The jury convicted the defendant and, following a separate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death.

On cross-examination, the sister admitted having given a statement to the police in which she had said that the defendant was not with her on March 5, but she claimed that the earlier statement was mistaken.

While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine.  After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana.

One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to the suspect's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to the suspect's house. The police knocked on the suspect's door and called out, \"Police. Open up. We have a search warrant.\" After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found the suspect with a large brown suitcase and put handcuffs on the suspect. A search of his person revealed a switchblade knife and a .45-caliber pistol. The suspect cursed the police and said, \"You never would have caught me with the stuff if it hadn't been for that lousy snitch Harvey!\" The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every room and closet. They found no one else, but one officer found an Uzi automatic weapon in a box on a closet shelf in the suspect's bedroom. In addition to charges relating to the cocaine in the suitcase, the suspect is charged with unlawful possession of weapons. The suspect moves pretrial to suppress the use as evidence of the weapons seized by the police and of the statement he made. As to the Uzi automatic weapon, the suspect's motion to suppress should be",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. granted, because the search exceeded the scope needed to find out if other persons were present.",
            "optionB": "B. granted, because once the object of the warrant--the brown suitcase--had been found and seized, no further search of the house is permitted.",
            "optionC": "C. denied, because the police were lawfully in the bedroom and the weapon was immediately identifiable as being subject to seizure.",
            "optionD": "D. denied, because the police were lawfully in the house and had probable cause to believe that weapons were in the house."

They then conducted a sweep of the house, finding no one else, but an officer found an Uzi automatic weapon in a box on a closet shelf in the suspect's bedroom.",
            "Rule_Application": "A protective sweep is allowed to ensure officer safety, but it is limited to areas where a person could be hiding. The search of the box on the closet shelf exceeded the scope of the protective sweep, as it was not a place where a person could be hiding.",

She knew where the neighbor kept the necklace because she had been in the neighbor's house on many occasions when the neighbor had taken off the necklace and put it away in a jewelry box in the bathroom. One night, the woman went to the neighbor's house. The neighbor was away, and the house was dark. The woman opened the bathroom window, saw the jewelry box on the counter, and started to climb inside. As her leg cleared the window sill, the neighbor's cat let out a loud screech.

        "question": "  A woman who is a computer whiz decided to dedicate herself to exposing persons who traffic in child pornography. She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Deny it as to all photographs.",
            "optionB": "B. Grant it as to all photographs, because the woman acted without probable cause.",

            "Legal_Concept": "Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, particularly in the context of private searches and government involvement.",
            "Fact_Analysis": "The woman, a private individual, initially entered the defendant's computer and copied a file without government involvement. However, the second entry was prompted by a federal agent's offer of a monetary reward, which raises questions about government agency and Fourth Amendment implications.",
            "Rule_Application": "A private search does not trigger Fourth Amendment protections. However, if a private individual is acting as a government agent, their actions may be subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny. In this case, the woman's second entry into the defendant's computer, prompted by the federal agent's offer, may be considered a government-sponsored search, violating the Fourth Amendment.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "The court should grant the motion to suppress only as to the second set of photographs, as the woman's actions in that instance may be considered a government-sponsored search without a warrant, violating the Fourth Amendment.

Deliberation is defined as \"cool reflection for any length of time, no matter how brief.\" The defendant, despondent and angry over losing his job, was contemplating suicide. He took his revolver, went to a bar, and drank until he was very intoxicated. A customer on the next stool was telling the bartender how it was necessary for companies to downsize and become more efficient in order to keep the economy strong. The defendant turned to him and said, \"Why don't you shut the hell up.\" The customer responded, \"This is a free country and I can say what I want,\" all the while shaking his finger at the defendant.

Honestly believing that their actions were permitted by the U.S. Constitution, the police talked one of the employee's neighbors into going to the employee's home with a hidden tape recorder to engage him in a conversation about the crime. During the conversation, the employee admitted committing the robbery. The employee was charged in state court with the robbery. He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions. Assume that a clear precedent from the state supreme court holds that the conduct of the police in making the recording violated the employee's rights under the state constitution, and that the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for this violation. Should the court grant the employee's motion?",

At a sidebar conference, the defendant's lawyer sought permission to ask the plaintiff about two prior intersection accidents in the last 12 months where he received traffic citations for failing to stop at stop signs. The plaintiff's lawyer objected. Should the court allow defense counsel to ask the plaintiff about the two prior incidents?",

The officer later obtained computerized records of that day's deposits and withdrawals at the savings and loan, which allowed the calculation of how much cash was taken in the robbery. A month later, the teller testified before a grand jury, which indicted the defendant. The teller and the eyewitness both died of unrelated causes shortly afterward.

The purchaser paid the landowner $5000 which the landowner accepted and the landowner delivered to the purchaser a deed which was properly executed complete and ready for recording in every detail except that the space in the deed for the lot number was left blank. The landowner told the purchaser to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his decision and then to record the deed. The purchaser visited the development the next day and completely changed his mind selecting Lot 25. He filled in Lot 25 and duly recorded the deed. The price of Lot 25 and its fair market value was $7500. Before the landowner had time to learn of the purchaser's actions the purchaser sold Lot 25 to a neighbor for $6000 by a duly and properly executed delivered and recorded warranty deed. The neighbor knew that the landowner had put a price of $7500 on Lot 25 but he knew no other facts regarding the landowner-purchaser transaction. The neighbor's attorney accurately reported the purchaser's record title to be good marketable and free of encumbrances.

        "question": " While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by the woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile said to the woman: \"I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.\" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill. The son having no assets died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating that the son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The father replied: \"If you don't file a claim against my son's estate I will pay what he owed you.\" The father honestly believed that he did not owe the creditor anything and at first refused to pay anything to the creditor. If the creditor honestly believing that the father owed him $200 then accepts $150 from the father in settlement of the claim will the creditor succeed in an action against the father for the remaining $50?",

The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently the store by a written memorandum to a private detective proposed to pay the detective $200 \"for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire.\" Thereafter in August 2007 the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September 2007 an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store\u2019s president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December 2007 as a result of the detective\u2019s investigation the store\u2019s employee was convicted of burning the store.

        "question": "  A new business enterprise about to commence the manufacture of clothing entered into written agreement to purchase all of its monthly requirements of a certain elasticized fabric for a period of three years from a fabric company at a specified unit price and agreed upon delivery and payment terms. The agreement also provided: I. The parties covenant not to assign this contract. II. Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company. The fabric company promptly made an \"assignment of the contract\" to a finance company as security for a $100000 loan. The new enterprise subsequently ordered took delivery of and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5000) for the new enterprise\u2019s requirement of the fabric for the first month of its operation. Which of the following accurately states the legal effect of the covenant not to assign the contract?",

Neither party tendered performance on the dates stated. On May 3 2007 the builder notified the landowner in writing of the builder's election to cancel the contract because of the landowner's failure to deliver title by May 1 . On May 12 the landowner notified the builder that some unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that the landowner was entitled to a reasonable time to complete. The notification also included a promise that the landowner would be ready to perform by May 29 and that he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date. The landowner obtained a certificate of occupancy and appropriate documents of title and he tendered performance on May 29. The builder refused. The landowner brought an action to recover damages for breach of contract. The decision in the case will most likely be determined by whether",

Both were traveling salesmen--one for a pharmaceutical company and the other for a widget manufacturer. The pharmaceutical salesman wrote the widget salesman by United States mail on Friday October 8: I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club and will buy your Sujocki for $1200 upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or before noon November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand. Sincerely [signed] the pharmaceutical salesman The widget salesman replied by mail the following day: I accept your offer and promise to deliver the bike as you specified. Sincerely [signed] the widget salesman This letter although properly addressed was misdirected by the postal service and not received by the pharmaceutical salesman until November 10. The pharmaceutical salesman had bought another Sujocki bike from a different friend for $1050 a few hours before. The friend saw the widget salesman at the Interurban Country Club on November 11 and said: \"I sold my Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman yesterday for $1050. Would you consider selling me yours for $950?\" The widget salesman replied: \"I'll let you know in a few days.\" On November 12 the widget salesman took his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman's residence; he arrived at 11:15 a.m. The pharmaceutical salesman was asleep and did not answer the ringing doorbell until 12:15 p.m. The pharmaceutical salesman then rejected the widget salesman's bike on the ground that he had already bought someone else's bike. In the pharmaceutical salesman's letter of October 8 what was the legal effect of the language: \"This offer is not subject to countermand\"?",

Would you consider selling me yours for $950?\" The widget salesman replied: \"I'll let you know in a few days.\" On November 12 the widget salesman took his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman's residence; he arrived at 11:15 a.m. The pharmaceutical salesman was asleep and did not answer the ringing doorbell until 12:15 p.m. The pharmaceutical salesman then rejected the widget salesman's bike on the ground that he had already bought someone else's bike. In a lawsuit by the widget salesman against the pharmaceutical salesman for breach of contract what would the court probably decide regarding the widget salesman's letter of October 9?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The letter bound both parties to a unilateral contract as soon as the widget salesman mailed it.",
            "optionB": "B. Mailing of the letter by the widget salesman did not of itself prevent a subsequent effective revocation by the pharmaceutical salesman of his offer.",

The widget salesman replied by mail, accepting the offer. However, the letter was misdirected and not received until November 10. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical salesman bought another motorcycle from a different friend.",
            "Rule_Application": "In a unilateral contract, the offeror's offer remains freely revocable until the offeree begins performance. Since the widget salesman's letter was not an appropriate method of acceptance, the pharmaceutical salesman's offer remained revocable. The pharmaceutical salesman's subsequent purchase of another motorcycle effectively revoked the original offer.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "The court would likely decide that the widget salesman's letter of October 9 did not bind the pharmaceutical salesman to the contract, as the offer was revoked before acceptance. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."

        "question": "  On March 2 a landowner and a builder orally agreed that the builder would erect a boathouse on the landowner's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse across a neighbor's lot to a lake. The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15 and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2500 on March 15; $2500 when the boathouse was completed; $5000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel. Assume that the landowner paid the $2500 on March 15 that the builder completed the boathouse that the landowner paid the second installment of $2500 and that the builder completed the digging of the channel but not until July 1. Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense. Which of the following is (are) correct?  I. The landowner has a cause of action against the builder for breach of contract.

In relevant part this agreement recited \"[the factory] hereby transfers and assigns to [the finance company] its [the factory's] October 1 mechanical dog contract with [the store] as security for a 50-day loan of $15000 the advance and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged by [the factory]. . .\" No copy of this agreement or statement relating to it was filed in an office of public record. On October 15 the factory notified the store \"We regret to advise that our master shaft burned out last night because our night supervisor let the lubricant level get too low. We have just fired the supervisor but the shaft cannot be repaired or replaced until about January 1. We can guarantee delivery of your order however not later than January 20.\" The store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1000 dogs at $30 per unit by November 15. By November 16 the factory without legal excuse has delivered no dogs and the store has brought an action against the factory. In an action brought on November 16 by the store against the finance company on account of the factory's default the store can recover ",

On July 1 when the reasonable value of the television set was $250 the teenager sent the dealer a signed letter stating \"I'll only pay you $300; that is all the set is worth.\" In an action against the teenager for money damages on July 2 what is the maximum amount that the dealer will be entitled to recover?",

The homeowner however told the builder on January 2 before the contract was signed that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1. Because she was overextended on other construction jobs the builder did not complete the house until October 15. The landowner returned on November 1 as planned and occupied the house. Ten days later after making the $40000 final payment to the builder the landowner learned for the first time that the house had not been completed until October 15. If the landowner sues the builder for breach of contract on account of the fifteen-day delay in completion which of the following will the court probably decide?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The homeowner will recover damages as specified in the contract i.e. $500 multiplied by fifteen.",
            "optionB": "B. The homeowner will recover his actual damages if any caused by the delay in completion.",
            "optionC": "C. Having waived the delay by occupying the house and making the final payment the landowner will recover nothing.",
            "optionD": "D. The landowner will recover nothing because the contractual completion date was impliedly modified to November 1 when the landowner on January 2 advised the builder about the landowner's prospective trip and return date."

            "Legal_Concept": "Liquidated damages clause in a contract, particularly the distinction between a valid liquidated damages provision and a penalty.",
            "Fact_Analysis": "The landowner and builder entered into a contract with a liquidated damages clause, specifying a daily penalty of $500 for delays beyond the October 1 completion date. The landowner informed the builder of their vacation plans and return date, but the builder still failed to meet the deadline, completing the house on October 15.",
            "Rule_Application": "A liquidated damages provision is enforceable if it represents a reasonable estimate of the damages that would be incurred in the event of a breach. However, if the provision is deemed a penalty, it will not be enforced. In this case, the provision appears to be a penalty, as the landowner's absence during the delay period means they did not suffer any actual harm.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "The court will likely decide that the landowner will recover their actual damages, if any, caused by the delay in completion, rather than the specified liquidated damages. This supports option B."

The owner agreed to pay $10000 for the work upon its completion. The owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement and had no ownership interest in the premises. Shortly before the agreement was signed the owner and landscape architect orally agreed that the writing would not become binding on either party unless the owner's spouse should approve the landscaping design. If the owner's spouse disapproves of the design and the owner refuses to allow the landscape architect to proceed with the work is evidence of the oral agreement admissible in the landscape architect's action against the owner for breach of contract?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Yes because the oral agreement required approval by a third party.",
            "optionB": "B. Yes because the evidence shows that the writing was intended to take effect only if the approval occurred.",
            "optionC": "C. No because the parol evidence rule bars evidence of a prior oral agreement even if the latter is consistent with the terms of a partial integration.",

The spouse disapproved, and the owner refused to allow the work to proceed.",
            "Rule_Application": "The parol evidence rule generally bars evidence of prior oral agreements that contradict or add to a written agreement. However, an exception applies when the extrinsic evidence proves the existence of a condition precedent to the written agreement. In this case, the oral agreement established a condition precedent (spousal approval) that must be met before the written agreement takes effect.",

The owner agreed to pay $10000 for the work upon its completion. The owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement and had no ownership interest in the premises. At the owner's insistence the written owner-architect agreement contained a provision that neither party would be bound unless the owner's law partner an avid student of landscaping should approve the landscape architect's design. Before the landscape architect commenced the work the owner's law partner in the presence of both the owner and the landscape architect expressly disapproved the landscaping design. Nevertheless the owner ordered the landscape architect to proceed with the work and the landscape architect reluctantly did so. When the landscape architect's performance was 40% complete the owner repudiated his duty if any to pay the contract price or any part thereof. If the landscape architect now sues the owner for damages for breach of contract which of the following concepts best supports the landscape architect's claim?",

            "Rule_Application": "When a party waives a condition after the time for its fulfillment has passed, or when the other party has relied on the waiver, it becomes an irrevocable waiver. In this case, the owner's order to proceed with the work despite the law partner's disapproval constitutes a waiver, and the landscape architect's reliance on it by completing 40% of the work makes the waiver irreversible.",

In this case, the father's promise was made in exchange for the lender making the loan to his daughter.

By late Saturday afternoon the painter realized that he had underestimated the time it would take to finish the work over the weekend unless he hired a helper. He also stated that to do so would require an additional charge of $200 for the work. The woman told the painter that she apparently had no choice but to pay \"whatever it takes\" to get the work done as scheduled.

In excavating for the foundation and underground utilities the builder encountered a massive layer of granite at a depth of 15 feet. By reasonable safety criteria the building's foundation required a minimum excavation of 25 feet. When the contract was made neither the property owner nor the builder was aware of the subsurface granite for the presence of which neither party had hired a qualified expert to test. Claiming accurately that removal of enough granite to permit the construction as planned would cost him an additional $3 million and a probable net loss on the contract of $2 million the builder refused to proceed with the work unless the property owner would promise to pay an additional $2.5 million for the completed building. If the property owner refuses and sues the builder for breach of contract which of the following will the court probably decide?",

On May 1 the widow wrote Nirvana a signed letter offering to buy \"one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment for $180000 cash on delivery not later than June 1.\" By coincidence Nirvana wrote the widow a signed letter on May 1 offering to sell her \"one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment for $180000 cash on delivery not later than June 1.\" These letters crossed in the mail and were respectively received and read by the widow and Nirvana on May 2.  On May 4 the widow and Nirvana Motors both signed a single document evidencing a contract for the sale by Nirvana to the widow \"as a wedding gift for the widow's son\" a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan under the same terms as previously stated in their correspondence. On May 5 the widow handed the son a carbon copy of this document. In reliance on the prospective gift the son on May 20 sold his nearly new Cheetah (an expensive sports car) to a dealer at a \"bargain\" price of $50000 and immediately informed the widow and Nirvana that he had done so. On May 25 however the widow and Nirvana Motors by mutual agreement rescinded in a signed writing \"any and all agreements heretofore made between the undersigned parties for the sale-and-purchase of a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan.\" Later that day Nirvana sold for $190000 cash to another buyer the only new Mark XX Rolls-Royce that it had in stock or could readily obtain elsewhere. On June 1 the son tendered $180000 in cash to Nirvana Motors and demanded delivery to him \"within a reasonable time\" of new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment.

In the written advertisement to which the tire salesman had responded but not in the bid form the county had stated \"Multiple awards may be issued if they are in the best interests of the county.\" No definite quantity of tires to be bought by the county from the tire salesman was specified in any of these documents. In January 1991 the tire salesman learned that the county was buying some of its tires from one of the tire salesman's competitors. Contending that the tire salesman-county agreement was a requirements contract the tire salesman sued the county for the damages caused by the county buying some of its tires from the competitor. If the court concludes that the tire salesman-county contract is an agreement by the county to buy its tire requirements from the tire salesman the tire salesman probably will",

After the daughter had paid the $3000 but before the car had been delivered to her one of retailer's sales staff sold and delivered the same car to a customer for $10000.

The fee includes the use of the boat with the woman as the captain and one other crew member as well as fishing tackle and bait. On May 1 a father agreed with the woman that the father would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for himself and his family for $500. The father paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by the woman as liquidated damages in the event the father canceled or failed to appear. At the time of contracting the woman told the father to be at the dock at 5 a.m. on May 15. The father and his family however did not show up on May 15 until noon. In the meantime the owner of the boat agreed at 10 a.m. to take a woman and her family out fishing for the rest of the day. The woman had happened to come by and inquire about the possibility of such an outing. In view of the late hour the owner of the boat charged the woman $400 and stayed out two hours beyond the customary return time. The father's failure to appear until noon was due to the fact that he had been trying to charter another boat across the bay at a lower rate and had gotten lost after he was unsuccessful in getting such a charter. Which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the rights of the parties?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The woman can retain the $200 paid by the father because it would be difficult for the woman to establish her actual damages and the sum appears to have been a reasonable forecast in light of anticipated loss of profit from the charter.",

The lawyer replied that her usual charge was $100 per hour and estimated that the legal work on behalf of the client would cost about $5000 at that rate. The client said \"Okay let's proceed with it\" and the lawyer timely and successfully completed the work. Because of unexpected title problems the lawyer reasonably spent 75 hours on the matter and shortly thereafter mailed the client a bill for $7500 with a letter itemizing the work performed and time spent. The client responded by a letter expressing his good-faith belief that the lawyer had agreed to a total fee of no more than $5000.

The writing provided in a clause separately signed by the computer whiz that \"No modifications shall be binding on the corporation unless made in writing and signed by the corporation's authorized representative.\" Because of family problems the computer whiz delivered and the corporation accepted only two game-designs a year for the first three years; but the games were a commercial success and the corporation made no objection. Accordingly the computer whiz spent substantial sums on new computer equipment that would aid in speeding up future design work. In the first quarter of the fourth year however the corporation terminated the contract on the ground that the computer whiz had breached the annual-quantity term.

The collector who had insured the painting for $300000 with an insurance company promised to pay $25000 to a full-time investigator for the insurance company if he effected the return of the painting to her in good condition. By company rules the insurance company permits its investigators to accept and retain rewards from policyholders for the recovery of insured property. The investigator by long and skillful detective work recovered the picture and returned it undamaged to the collector. If the collector refuses to pay the investigator anything and he sues her for $25000 what is the probable result under the prevailing modern rule?",

On March 2 the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a knitwear company on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the knitwear company order was for a rush job the knitwear company and the textile company included in their contract a liquidated damages clause providing that the textile company would pay $5000 for each day's delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine and as a result the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the knitwear company. The textile company paid $25000 to the knitwear company as liquidated damages and now sues the mechanic for $25000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain little or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5000 liquidated damages clause in the knitwear-textile contract is valid which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic's best defense to the textile company's action?",

Such modifications however may be authorized only in writing signed by both parties. During construction the contractor incorporated into the structure overhanging gargoyles and other \"extras\" orally requested by the owner for orally agreed prices in addition to the contract price.

In performing each contract the seller delivered the grain to the buyer and upon delivery the buyer signed an invoice that showed an agreed upon price for that delivery.

The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery. In all of their prior transactions and without objection from the seller the buyer took 15 days to pay and deducted 5% from the invoice price. The same delivery procedure and invoice were used in the present contract as had been used previously. The present contract called for a single delivery of wheat at a price of $300000.

            "Fact_Analysis": "The antique car was destroyed by fire on July 15, before the risk of loss had passed to the buyer, and without fault of either party. The contract was formed on June 1, with the car identified at the time of contract formation, and delivery was scheduled for August 1.",
            "Rule_Application": "Under UCC \u00a7 2-613, the total destruction of identified goods without fault of either party before the risk of loss has passed to the buyer avoids the contract. UCC \u00a7 2-501 confirms that the goods were identified at the time of contract formation. As a result, both parties are relieved of their respective obligations to perform.",

After the contractor had spent $45000 on labor and materials including $5000 on oak flooring not yet installed the homeowner informed the contractor that the homeowner had lost his job and could not pay for any services. The homeowner told the contractor to stop working immediately. The reasonable market value of the labor and materials provided by the contractor at that point including the oak flooring was $40000. The contractor used the $5000 worth of oak flooring on another job.  In an action by the contractor against the homeowner for damages which of the following would be the largest amount of damages recoverable by the contractor?",

The contractor's profit of $10,000 should also be included in the damages calculation.",

        "question": "  On March 1 a mechanic contracted to repair a textile company's knitting machine by March 6. On March 2 the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer's order was for a rush job the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause providing that the textile company would pay $5000 for each day's delay in delivery after March 15.  The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine and as a result the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic's best defense to the textile company's action?",

The buyer did not make the selection by March 1 and on March 2 the seller notified the buyer that because of the buyer's failure to select the seller would not deliver the candy bars.

On Monday of the second week the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender. Was the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5000 pounds of flour?",

Although the general contractor had no reason to doubt the subcontractor's ability to perform the general contractor wanted to be sure that the subcontractor was on track for delivery in September. He therefore wrote a letter on July 1 to the subcontractor demanding that the subcontractor provide assurance of its ability to meet the September 1 deadline.

This offer is not subject to countermand. Sincerely [signed] the pharmaceutical salesman The widget salesman replied by mail the following day: I accept your offer and promise to deliver the bike as you specified. Sincerely [signed] the widget salesman  This letter although properly addressed was misdirected by the postal service and not received by the pharmaceutical salesman until November 10. The pharmaceutical salesman had bought another Sujocki bike from a different friend for $1050 a few hours before. The friend saw the widget salesman at the Interurban Country Club on November 11 and said: \"I sold my Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman yesterday for $1050.

The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying \"I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer.\" This note was inadvertently placed in the student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1 the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. The student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1 it was announced that the student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $500.

The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40000 upon the landowner's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further under a \"liquidated damages\" clause in the agreement the builder promised to pay the landowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1. The landowner however told the builder on January 2 before the contract was signed that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1. The builder completed the house on October 14 and when the landowner returned on November 1 requested the final payment of $40000 and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. The landowner however refused to pay any part of the final installment after the architect told him that the builder \"did a great job and I find no defects worth mentioning; but the builder's contract price was at least $40000 too high especially in view of the big drop in housing values within the past ten months.

The manufacturer tendered 1,000 towels, which the retailer rejected due to finding a better price term from another supplier.",

The developer told the buyer that the lot abutted a national park and that the water for the house came from a natural artesian spring. The developer knew that both of these representations were important to the buyer and that both were false. The buyer moved into the house and eight months later learned that a private golf course was being constructed on the adjacent land and that the water for his house was piped in from the city reservoir. The buyer immediately sued the developer to avoid the contract. The construction of the golf course will probably increase the market value of the buyer's property and the water from the city reservoir exceeds all established standards for drinking water.

Under state law he cannot acquire tenure until after five consecutive annual contracts. In his third year, the assistant professor was notified that he was not being rehired for the following year. Applicable state law and college rules did not require either a statement of reasons or a hearing, and in fact neither was offered to the assistant professor. Which of the following, if established, most strongly supports the college in refusing to give the assistant professor a statement of reasons or an opportunity for a hearing?",
        "options": {

Pursuant to this federal law and all proper federal procedural requirements, that agency has adopted very strict standards for the licensing of such facilities. As a result, the cost of disposing of tires in licensed facilities is substantial. A particular state has a very large fleet of motor vehicles, including trucks used to support state-owned commercial activities and police cars. The state disposes of used tires from both kinds of state motor vehicles in a stated-owned and -operated facility. This state facility is unlicensed, but its operation in actual practice meets most of the standards imposed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency on facilities it licenses to dispose of tires. Consistent with United States Supreme Court precedent, may the state continue to dispose of its used tires in this manner?",

        "question": "  Public schools in a state are financed, in large part, by revenue derived from real estate taxes imposed by each school district on the taxable real property located in that district. Public schools also receive other revenue from private gifts, federal grants, student fees, and local sales taxes. For many years, the state has distributed additional funds, which come from the state treasury, to local school districts in order to equalize the funds available on a per-student basis for each public school district. These additional funds are distributed on the basis of a state statutory formula that considers only the number of students in each public school district and the real estate tax revenue raised by that district. The formula does not consider other revenue received by a school district from different sources. The school boards of two school districts, together with parents and schoolchildren in those districts, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the state from allocating the additional funds from the state treasury to this formula. They allege that the failure of the state, in allocating this additional money, to take into account a school district's sources of revenue other than revenue derived from taxes levied on real estate located there violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The complaint does not allege that the allocation of the additional state funds based on the current statutory formula has resulted in a failure to provide minimally adequate education to any child.

In the last state legislative reapportionment, the board, by a unanimous vote, divided the greater metropolitan area, composed of a large city and several contiguous townships, into three equally populated state legislative districts.

A federal statute provides that all liability of an interstate mover to a shipper for loss of or damage to the shipper's goods in transit is governed exclusively by the contract between them. The statute also requires the interstate carrier to offer a shipper at least two contracts with different levels of liability. In full compliance with that federal statute, the interstate carrier offered the shipper a choice between two shipping agreements that provided different levels of liability on the part of the interstate carrier.

The ordinance requires the operation of the city cemetery to be supported primarily by revenues derived from the sale of cemetery lots to individuals. The ordinance further provides that the purchase of a cemetery lot entitles the owner to perpetual care of the lot and entitles the owner to erect on the lot, at the owner's expense, a memorial monument or marker of the owner's choice, subject to certain size restrictions. The city ordinance requires the city to maintain the cemetery, including mowing the grass, watering flowers, and plowing snow, and provides for the expenditure of city tax funds for such maintenance if revenues from the sale of cemetery lots are insufficient. Although cemetery lots are sold at full fair market value, which includes the current value of perpetual care, the revenue from the sale of such lots has been insufficient in recent years to maintain the cemetery. As a result, a small amount of city tax funds has also been used for that purpose. A group of city taxpayers brings suit against the city challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance insofar as it permits the owner of a cemetery lot to erect a religious memorial monument or marker on his or her lot.

In addition, such an employee must, upon request, be granted a post-dismissal hearing before an administrative board to seek reinstatement and back pay. The statute precludes any other hearing or opportunity to respond to the charges. That post-dismissal hearing must occur within six months after the dismissal takes effect. The burden of proof at such a hearing is on the state, and the board may uphold the dismissal only if it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

As part of that program, the state limits, by statute, oyster fishing in its coastal waters to persons who have state oyster permits.

The permits are effective for only one year from the date of their issuance and are awarded on the basis of lottery, in which there is no differentiation between resident and nonresident applicants. However, each nonresident who obtains a permit is charged an annual permit fee that is $5 more than the fee charged residents.

A state statute requires occupants of residences with basements susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences tested for the presence of radon and to take specified remedial steps if the test indicates the presence of radon above specified levels. The statute also provides that the testing for radon may be done only by testers licensed by a state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards relating to the accuracy of its testing. These standards may easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology required to meet them is 50% more expensive than the technology required to measure radon accumulations in a slightly less accurate manner. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not license radon testers. However, a federal statute authorizes the EPA to advise on the accuracy of various methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably accurate. A recently established state firm uses a testing method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. The firm is also included by the EPA on a list of testers using methods of testing it believes to be reasonably accurate. The firm applies for a state radon testing license, but its application is denied because the firm cannot demonstrate that the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate to meet the rigorous state statutory standards.

The County Tax Commission, in making its assessments, has uniformly and consistently determined the \"actual value\" of real property solely by reference to the price at which the particular property was last sold. In recent years, the market values of real property in the county have been rising at the rate of 15% per year.

The reason the taxes on the homeowner's home are higher than those imposed on the other similar homes in similar neighborhoods is that she bought her home much more recently than the other owners and, therefore, it is assessed at a much higher \"actual value\" than their homes.

However, the city continued to allow machines dispensing other types of publications on the public sidewalks. As a result of the city ordinance, 30 of the 300 sidewalk machines that were dispensing publications in the city were removed. Is this city ordinance constitutional?",

Prior to trial, the prosecutor announced that new information indicated that the charges should be dropped. He then dropped the charges without further explanation, and the records relating thereto were closed to the public pursuant to the state statute. The newspaper in the state conducted an investigation to determine why the businessman was not prosecuted, but was refused access to the closed official state records. In an effort to determine whether the law enforcement agencies involved were properly doing their duty, the newspaper filed suit against appropriate state officials to force opening of the records and to invalidate the statute on constitutional grounds.

Components for these computers are manufactured elsewhere in the state and in other states, then shipped to this city, where the computers are assembled. An ordinance of the city imposes a special license tax on all of the many companies engaged in the business of assembling computers in that city. The tax payable by each such company is a percentage of the company's gross receipts. The state statute that authorizes municipalities to impose this license tax has a \"State content\" provision. To comply with this provision of state law, the city license tax ordinance provides that the tax paid by any assembler of computers subject to this tax ordinance will be reduced by a percentage equal to the proportion of computer components manufactured in the state. A prominent company assembles computers in the city and sells them from its offices in the city to buyers throughout the United States. All of the components of its computers come from outside the state. Therefore, the company must pay the city license tax in full without receiving any refund. Other city computer assemblers use components manufactured in the state in varying proportions and, therefore, are entitled to partial reductions of their city license tax payments.

        "question": " A state constitution provides that in every criminal trial \"the accused shall have the right to confront all witnesses against him face to face.\" A defendant was convicted in state court of child abuse based on testimony from a six-year-old child. The child testified while she was seated behind one-way glass, which allowed the defendant to see the child but did not allow the child to see the defendant. The defendant appealed to the state supreme court claiming that the inability of the witness to see the defendant while she testified violated both the United States Constitution and the state constitution. Without addressing the federal constitutional issue, the state supreme court reversed the defendant's conviction and ordered a new trial. The state supreme court held that \"the constitution of this state is clear, and it requires that while testifying in a criminal trial, a witness must be able to see the defendant.\" The state petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. On which ground should the United States Supreme Court DENY the state's petition?",

Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was \"to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats\" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser sued the county, claiming that the regulation has taken the purchaser's property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?",

Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization's request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization's placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator's decision was final.

        "question": "  In response to the need for additional toxic waste landfills in a state, the state's legislature enacted a law authorizing a state agency to establish five new state-owned and state-operated toxic waste landfills. The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community's residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens' group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill.

The state awarded the contract to the local company. The interstate company sued to overturn this decision. Should the interstate company prevail?",

After reviewing then-current levels of public school student performance, the officials of a state became concerned that several of its public school districts would lose their federal funding after the administration of the first national achievement test. Then-current levels of private school student performance were substantially higher.  In order to improve the chances of those school districts retaining their federal funding, the state recently enacted a law that requires all children of elementary and secondary school age to attend the schools operated by their respective local public school districts.

Following his most recent conviction, he professed to have undergone a religious conversion and proclaimed himself to be the divine minister of \"St. Rockport,\" an alleged messiah who would shortly be making his appearance on earth. The defendant solicited cash donations from the public to support his efforts to spread the word of St. Rockport and his coming appearance on earth. Following complaints by several contributors who claimed he defrauded them, the defendant was again charged with fraud under this state statute. The charge was that the defendant \"should have known that his representations about St. Rockport were false and, therefore, that he made them solely to collect cash donations for his personal gain.\" A witness for the prosecution in the defendant's trial stated that the defendant had admitted that, at times, he had doubts about the existence of St. Rockport.

        "question": "  Radon is a harmful gas found in the soil of certain regions of the United States. A state statute requires occupants of residences with basements susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences tested for the presence of radon and to take specified remedial steps if the test indicates the presence of radon above specified levels. The statute also provides that the testing for radon may be done only by testers licensed by a state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards relating to the accuracy of its testing. These standards may easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology required to meet them is 50% more expensive than the technology required to measure radon accumulations in a slightly less accurate manner. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not license radon testers. However, a federal statute authorizes the EPA to advise on the accuracy of various methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably accurate. A recently established state firm uses a testing method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. The firm is also included by the EPA on a list of testers using methods of testing it believes to be reasonably accurate. The firm applies for a state radon testing license, but its application is denied because the firm cannot demonstrate that the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate to meet the rigorous state statutory standards. The firm sues appropriate state officials in federal court claiming that the state may not constitutionally exclude the firm from performing the required radon tests in the state.

A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community's residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens' group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court.

        "question": "  By her validly executed will, a woman devised a certain tract of land to her son for his life with remainder to such of his children as should be living at his death, \"Provided, however, that no such child of my son shall mortgage or sell, or attempt to mortgage or sell, his or her interest in the property prior to attaining 25 years of age: and, if any such child of my son shall violate this provision, then upon such violation his or her interest shall pass to and become the property of the remaining children of my son then living, share and share alike.\" The woman's will included an identical provision for each of her four other children concerning four other tracts of land. The residuary clause of the will gave the residuary estate to the woman's five children equally. The woman died and was survived by the five children named in her will and by eleven grandchildren. Several additional grandchildren have since been born. In an action for a declaration of rights, it was claimed that the attempted gifts to the woman's grandchildren were entirely void and that the interests following the life estates to the woman's children passed to the children absolutely by the residuary clause. Assuming that the action was properly brought with all necessary parties and with a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the interests of unborn and infant grandchildren, the decision should be that",

During this time the woman identified herself using the man's last name with the knowledge and consent of the man. The couple maintained several charge accounts at retail stores under the husband's last name, and they filed joint income tax returns using his last name for both of them. Within this period the man decided to buy a home. The deed was in proper form and identified the grantees as \"Mr. and Mrs. [last name], and their heirs and assigns forever as tenants by the entirety.\" The man made a down payment of $10,000, and gave a note and mortgage for the unpaid balance. The couple signed the note and mortgage as husband and wife. The man made monthly payments as they became due until he and the woman had a disagreement and he abandoned her and the house.

However, construction of the streets has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances. College Avenue, a street in the Meadowview development, abuts a parcel of land that is adjacent to Meadowview and owned by a pharmacist. This parcel has no access to any public way except a poorly developed road that is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. The pharmacist sold the parcel to a friend.

        "question": "  A landowner holds title in fee simple to a tract of 1,500 acres. He desires to develop the entire tract as a golf course, country club, and residential subdivision. He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club; the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate the landowner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold. The landowner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established: I. Aside from the country club and golf course, there will be no land use other than for residential use and occupancy in the 1,500 acres. II. The residents of the subdivision will have unambiguous rights and access to the club and golf course facilities. III. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right to transfer his lot to a purchaser with all original benefits. IV. Each lot owner must be obligated to pay annual dues to a pro rata share (based on the number of lots) of the club's annual operating deficit (whether or not such owner desires to make use of club and course facilities). In the context of all aspects of the scheme, which of the following will offer the best chance of implementing the requirement that each lot owner pay annual dues to support the club and golf course?",

The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. The owner conveyed Lot 1 to a man and Lot 2 to a woman. The owner retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. The woman, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on her lot. The man erected a house on his lot. The owner made no complaint to either the man or woman concerning the houses they built. After both the man and woman had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots.

At the time of the decedent's death, there existed a mortgage on Blueacre that the decedent had given ten years earlier to secure a loan for the purchase of the farm.

The owner later mortgaged Blackacre to a woman to secure a loan of $50,000. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Subsequently, the owner conveyed Blackacre to a businessman. About a year later, the businessman borrowed $100,000 from an elderly widow and gave her a mortgage on Blackacre to secure repayment of the loan. The elderly widow did not know about the mortgage held by the woman. The understanding between the businessman and the elderly widow was that the businessman would use the $100,000 to pay off the mortgage held by the man and that the elderly widow would, therefore, have a first mortgage on Blackacre. The elderly widow's mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The businessman paid the $100,000 received from the elderly widow to the man and obtained and recorded a release of the the man's mortgage. The $50,000 debt secured by the woman's mortgage was not paid when it was due, and the woman brought an appropriate action to foreclose, joining the owner, the businessman, and the elderly widow as defendants and alleging that the woman's mortgage was senior to the elderly widow's mortgage on Blackacre. If the court rules that the elderly widow's mortgage is entitled priority over the woman's mortgage, which of the following determinations are necessary to support that ruling? I. The man's mortgage was originally senior to the woman's mortgage. II.

Shortly thereafter, the grandfather died testate. His grandson was his only heir at law. The grandfather's will left his entire estate to First Church. Twenty-five years ago, when he was 41, the grandson married Maria who was then 20 years old; they had one child. Maria and the child were killed in an automobile accident three years ago when the child was 21. The child died testate, leaving his entire estate to the American Red Cross. His father (the grandson) was the child's sole heir at law. Two years ago, the grandson married Zelda. They had no children. This year, the grandson died testate, survived by his widow, Zelda, to whom he left his entire estate. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unchanged by statute in the jurisdiction.

At Whiteacre, the agency has operated a waste-to-electricity recycling facility for 12 years. Blackacre and Whiteacre are in a remote area and Whiteacre is the only developed parcel of real estate within a ten-mile radius. The boundary line between Blackacre and Whiteacre had never been surveyed or marked on the face of the earth. During the past 12 years, some of the trucks bringing waste to the agency facility have dumped their loads so that the piles of waste extend from Whiteacre onto a portion of Blackacre. However, prior to the four-week period during each calendar year when the agency facility is closed for inspection and repairs, the waste piles are reduced to minimal levels so that during each of the four-week closures no waste was, in fact, piled on Blackacre. Neither the man nor any representative of the agency knew the facts about the relation of the boundary line to the waste piles. The time for acquiring title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years. Last year, the man died, and his son succeeded him as the owner of Blackacre. The son became aware of the facts, demanded that the agency stop using Blackacre for the piling of waste, and, when the agency refused his demand, brought an appropriate action to enjoin any such use of Blackacre in the future.

Two years ago, the banker died and left Eastgate to her nephew for life, with remainder to her godson, his heirs and assigns. The nephew was 30 years old and the godson was 20 years old when the banker died. The devise of Eastgate was made subject to any mortgage on Eastgate in effect at the time of the banker's death. When the banker executed her will, the balance of the mortgage debt on Eastgate was less than $5,000. A year before her death, the banker suffered financial reverses; and in order to meet her debts, she had mortgaged Eastgate to secure a loan of $150,000. The entire principal of the mortgage remained outstanding when she died. As a result, the net annual income from Eastgate was reduced not only by real estate taxes and regular maintenance costs, but also by the substantial mortgage interest payments that were due each month. The nephew was very dissatisfied with the limited benefit that he was receiving from the life estate. When, earlier this year, Acme, Inc., proposed to purchase Eastgate, demolish the building, pay off the mortgage, and construct a 30-story office building, the nephew was willing to accept Acme's offer. However, the godson adamantly refused the offer, even though he, as the remainderman, paid the principal portion of each monthly mortgage amortization payment. The godson was independently wealthy and wanted to convert Eastgate into a public park when he became entitled to possession. When Acme realized that the godson would not change his mind, Acme modified its proposal to a purchase of the life estate of the nephew. Acme was ready to go ahead with its building plans, relying upon a large life insurance policy on the nephew's life to protect it against the economic risk of his death. The nephew's life expectancy was 45 years.

        "question": " A banker owned Goldacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. The banker and a buyer entered into a written agreement under which the buyer agreed to buy Goldacre for $100,000, its fair market value. The agreement contained all the essential terms of a real estate contract to sell and buy, including a date for closing. The required $50,000 down payment was made. The contract provided that in the event of the buyer's breach, the banker could retain the $50,000 deposit as liquidated damages. Before the date set for the closing in the contract, the buyer died. On the day that the administratrix of the buyer's estate was duly qualified, which was after the closing date, the administratrix made demand for return of the $50,000 deposit. The banker responded by stating that she took such demand to be a declaration that the administratrix did not intend to complete the contract and that the banker considered the contract at an end. The banker further asserted that she was entitled to retain, as liquidated damages, the $50,000. The reasonable market value of Goldacre had increased to $110,000 at that time. The administratrix brought an appropriate action against the banker to recover $50,000.

The neighbor held record title in fee simple to Blueacre, which adjoined Greenacre. Twelve years ago the owner's son succeeded to the original owner's title in fee simple in Greenacre and seven years ago the neighbor's daughter succeeded to the neighbor's title in fee simple to Blueacre by a deed which made no mention of a right-of-way or driveway. At the time the neighbor's daughter took title, there existed a driveway across Greenacre which showed evidence that it had been used regularly to travel between the main roadand Blueacre. Blueacre did have frontage on a side road, but this means of access was seldom used because it was not as convenient to the dwelling situated on Blueacre as was the main road. The driveway originally was established by the neighbor. The neighbor's daughter has regularly used the driveway since acquiring title. The period of time required to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is ten years. Six months ago the son notified the neighbor's daughter that the son planned to develop a portion of Greenacre as a residential subdivision and that the daughter should cease any use of the driveway. After some negotiations, the son offered to permit the daughter to construct another driveway to connect with the streets of the proposed subdivision. The daughter declined this offer on the ground that travel from Blueacre to the main road would be more circuitous. The neighbor's daughter brought an appropriate action against the son to obtain a definitive adjudication of the respective rights of the daughter and the son.

Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor.

The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner, on behalf of himself as the owner of the unsold lot, and on behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on Lot 1. Who is likely to prevail?",
        "options": {

The investor entered into a written contract to sell the land to a buyer. The contract between the investor and the buyer expressly provided that the investor would convey a marketable title. The buyer's attorney discovered that the title to the land was not marketable, and had not been marketable when the original seller conveyed to the investor. The buyer refused to complete the sale. The investor sued the original seller on multiple counts. One count was for breach of the contract between the seller and the investor for damages resulting from the seller's failure to convey to the investor marketable title, resulting in the loss of the sale of the land to the subsequent buyer. Who is likely to prevail on this count?",

It contained the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\" Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house.

Twenty years ago, the businesswoman conveyed the vacant tract to a grantee by a warranty deed that the businesswoman signed but the grantee did not. The deed contained a covenant by the grantee as owner of the vacant tract that neither he nor his heirs or assigns would \"erect any building\" on the vacant tract, in order to preserve the view of the river from the commercial building on the improved tract. The grantee intended to use the vacant tract as a nature preserve. The grantee promptly and properly recorded the deed. Last year, the businesswoman conveyed the improved tract to a businessman. A month later, the grantee died, devising all of his property, including the vacant land, to his cousin. Six weeks ago, the cousin began construction of a building on the vacant tract. The businessman objected and sued to enjoin construction of the building. Who is likely to prevail?",

The finance company has filed a timely motion in the foreclosure proceeding asking the court to require the bank to first foreclose on two of the four acres in the four-acre lot.

The same year, the husband, wife, and daughter were on a vacation when the plane in which they were flying went down, and all three were killed simultaneously. All three died intestate. The applicable statute in the jurisdiction provides that \"when title to property on its devolution depends on priority of death and there is insufficient evidence that the persons have died otherwise than simultaneous, the property of each person, shall be disposed of as if he had survived.\" An appropriate action was instituted by the heirs of the family.

In that year he executed and delivered to a purchaser a quitclaim deed which purported to release and quitclaim to the purchaser all of the right, title and interest of the owner in Blackacre. The purchaser accepted the quitclaim and placed the deed in his safety deposit box. The owner was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $35,000. In September, 2001, the owner executed and delivered to the creditor a warranty deed, purporting to convey the fee simple to Blackacre, in exchange for a full release of the debt he owed to the creditor. The creditor immediately recorded his deed. In December, 2001, the purchaser caused his quitclaim deed to Blackacre to be recorded and notified the creditor that he (the purchaser) claimed title. Assume that there is no evidence of occupancy of Blackacre and assume, further, that the jurisdiction where Blackacre is situated has a recording statute which required good faith and value as elements of the junior claimant's priority.

The defendant decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The defendant has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc.). After the defendant had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The defendant used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The plaintiff notified the defendant that cracks were developing in the building situated on the plaintiff's lot. The defendant took the view that any subsidence suffered by the plaintiff was due to the weight of the plaintiff's building, and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the plaintiff's soil been in its natural state. The defendant continued to excavate. The building on the plaintiff's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects.

Thereafter, she built a house on Lot 2, which she sold, house and lot, to a buyer. Consistent with the contract of sale and purchase, the deed conveying Lot 2 from the business woman to the buyer contained the following clause: In the event the buyer, his heirs or assigns, decide to sell the property hereby conveyed and obtain a purchaser ready, willing, and able to purchase Lot 2 and the improvements thereon on terms and conditions acceptable to the buyer, said Lot 2 and improvements shall be offered to the business woman, her heirs or assigns, on the same terms and conditions. The business woman, her heirs or assigns, as the case may be, shall have ten days from said offer to accept said offer and thereby to exercise said option. Three years after delivery and recording of the deed and payment of the purchase price, the buyer became ill and moved to a climate more compatible with his health. The buyer's daughter orally offered to purchase the premises from the buyer at its then fair market value. The buyer declined his daughter's offer but instead deeded Lot 2 to his daughter as a gift. Immediately thereafter, the buyer's daughter sold Lot 2 to a man at the then fair market value of Lot 2. The sale was completed by the delivery of deed and payment of the purchase price. At no time did the buyer or his daughter offer to sell Lot 2 to the business woman. The business woman learned of the conveyance to the buyer's daughter and the sale by the daughter to the man one week after the conveyance of Lot 2 from the daughter to the man. The business woman promptly brought an appropriate action against the man to enforce rights created in him by the deed of the business woman to the buyer. The business woman tendered the amount paid by the man into the court for whatever disposition the court deemed proper. The common-law Rule Against Perpetutities is unmodified by statute.

The brother made no payments to the aunt; and since the aunt's death 7 years ago, he has made no payments to his sister. For those 22 years, the brother has paid the real estate taxes on Blackacre, kept the building on Blackacre insured, and maintained the building. At all times, the sister has lived in a distant city and has never had anything to do with the aunt, her brother, or Blackacre. Recently, the sister needed money to run her business and demanded that her brother join her in selling Blackacre. He refused.

The owner later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a private lender, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the owner defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose on the mortgage on the owner's hotel at that time, but instead brought an action, appropriate under the laws of the jurisdiction and authorized by the mortgage loan documents, for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. The bank later brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The private lender was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted as follows: The bank purchased the hotel for $100,000 less than its mortgage balance.

For five years the farmer occupied Greenacre and conducted farming operations. The farmer never accounted to the rancher for any income, but the farmer did pay all real estate taxes when the taxes were due and kept the buildings located on Greenacre insured against loss from fire, storm, and flood. The rancher lived in a distant city and was interested only in realizing a profit from the sale of the land when market conditions produced the price the rancher wanted. The farmer died intestate, survived only by the farmer's sole heir. Thereafter, the sole heir occupied Greenacre but was inexperienced in farming operations. The result was a financial disaster. The sole heir failed to pay real estate taxes for two years. The appropriate governmental authority held a tax sale to recover the taxes due. At such sale the rancher was the only bidder and obtained a conveyance from the appropriate governmental authority upon payment of an amount sufficient to discharge the amounts due for taxes, plus interest and penalties, and the costs of holding the tax sale. The amount paid was one-third of the reasonable market value of Greenacre.

The purchaser entered into possession of Greenacre. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the purchaser discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on Greenacre, securing the payment of debt in the amount of 25% of the purchase price the purchaser had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the landowner had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the landowner. The value of Greenacre now is four times the amount on the debt secured by the mortgage. The purchaser quit possession of Greenacre and demanded that the landowner repay the amounts the purchaser had paid under the contract.

One week after the cousin's birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin's inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise. The investor considered suing the cousin but realized that she could not compel the cousin to convey the farm because it was still owned by the man. Two weeks after the cousin's birthday, the man died. Under his valid will, the man devised the farm to the cousin. Within a week, the executor of the man's estate gave the cousin an executor's deed to the farm in compliance with state law. The investor promptly learned of this transfer and demanded that the cousin convey the farm to her. The cousin refused. The investor sued the cousin for specific performance.

A businessman purchased one of the 50 lots and proposes to erect a service station and to conduct a retail business for the sale of gasoline, etc. A woman purchased a lot from a man who had purchased from the owner in 1998, and the deed had the provision that it quoted in the fact situation.

He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club; the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate the landowner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold. The landowner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established: I. Aside from the country club and golf course, there will be no land use other than for residential use and occupancy in the 1,500 acres. II. The residents of the subdivision will have unambiguous rights and access to the club and golf course facilities. III. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right to transfer his lot to a purchaser with all original benefits. IV.

        "question": "  An owner owned in fee simple three adjoining vacant lots fronting on a common street in a primarily residential section of a city which had no zoning laws. The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. The owner conveyed Lot 1 to a man and Lot 2 to a woman. The owner retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. The woman, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on her lot. The woman's house included a large window on the side facing Lot 3. The window provided a beautiful view from her living room, thereby adding value to the woman's house. The man erected a house on his lot. The owner made no complaint to either the man or woman concerning the houses they built. After both the man and woman had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that one-half of the way was located on each lot. The man and woman exchanged right-of-way deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded. After the man and woman had lived in their respective houses for thirty years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3. The man informed the woman that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected the woman to do the same. At about the same time, the owner began the erection of a six-story apartment house on Lot 3. If the apartment house is completed, it will block the view from the woman's window and will substantially reduce the value of her lot.

Goodacre had never been used as anything except a residence. The brother had been residing on Goodacre with his father at the time his father died. The sister had been residing in a distant city. After their father's funeral, the brother continued to live on Goodacre, but the sister returned to her own residence. There was no discussion between the brother and the sister concerning their common ownership, nor had there ever been any administration of their father's estate. The brother paid all taxes, insurance, and other carrying charges on Goodacre. He paid no rent or other compensation to his sister, nor did his sister request any such payment. Thirty years later, a series of disputes arose between the brother and the sister for the first time concerning their respective rights to Goodacre. The jurisdiction where the land is located recognized the usual common-law types of cotenancies, and there is no applicable legislation on the subject.

After the defendant had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The defendant used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The plaintiff notified the defendant that cracks were developing in the building situated on the plaintiff's lot. The defendant took the view that any subsidence suffered by the plaintiff was due to the weight of the plaintiff's building, and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the plaintiff's soil been in its natural state.

The windows are designed so that each insert can be easily inserted or removed from the window frame without tools to adjust to seasonal change and to facilitate the cleaning of the inserts. The new windows were expensive. The man purchased them on credit, signed a financing statement, and granted a security interest in the windows to a vendor, the supplier of the windows. The vendor promptly and properly filed and recorded the financing statement before the windows were installed. The man stored the old windows in the basement of Blackacre. This year, the man has suffered severe financial reverses and has defaulted on his mortgage obligation to the bank and on his obligation to the vendor.

The rancher lived in a distant city and was interested only in realizing a profit from the sale of the land when market conditions produced the price the rancher wanted. The farmer died intestate, survived only by the farmer's sole heir. Thereafter, the sole heir occupied Greenacre but was inexperienced in farming operations. The result was a financial disaster. The sole heir failed to pay real estate taxes for two years. The appropriate governmental authority held a tax sale to recover the taxes due. At such sale the rancher was the only bidder and obtained a conveyance from the appropriate governmental authority upon payment of an amount sufficient to discharge the amounts due for taxes, plus interest and penalties, and the costs of holding the tax sale. The amount paid was one-third of the reasonable market value of Greenacre. Thereafter, the rancher instituted an appropriate action against the sole heir to quiet title in and to recover possession of Greenacre. The sole heir asserted all defenses available to her. Except for the statutes related to real estate taxes and tax sales, there is no applicable statute. In this lawsuit, the rancher is entitled to a decree quieting title so that the rancher is the sole owner in fee simple of Greenacre",

        "question": "  A landowner owned Greenacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. The landowner entered into a valid written agreement with a purchaser under which the landowner agreed to sell and the purchaser agreed to buy Greenacre by installment purchase. The contract stipulated that the landowner would deliver to the purchaser, upon the payment of the last installment due, \"a warranty deed sufficient to convey the fee simple.\" The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The purchaser entered into possession of Greenacre. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the purchaser discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on Greenacre, securing the payment of debt in the amount of 25% of the purchase price the purchaser had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the landowner had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the landowner. The value of Greenacre now is four times the amount on the debt secured by the mortgage. The purchaser quit possession of Greenacre and demanded that the landowner repay the amounts the purchaser had paid under the contract. After the landowner refused the demand, the purchaser brought an appropriate action against the landowner to recover damages for the landowner's alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the purchaser?",

She did not conduct a title search of the land before she accepted the deed from the nephew. She promptly and properly recorded her deed. Last month, the uncle died, leaving the land to the nephew in his duly probated will. Both the nephew and the woman now claim ownership of the land.

The woman had objected to the district's plans for the stadium and was particularly upset about nighttime athletic events that attracted large crowds and that, at times, resulted in significant noise and light intensity levels. On nights of athletic events, the woman and her family members wore earplugs and could not sleep or enjoy a quiet evening until after 10 p.m. In addition, light from the stadium on those nights was bright enough to allow reading a newspaper in the woman's yard.

The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller's home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner's insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance. The buyer declared the contract voided by the fire, but the seller asserted a right to enforce the contract despite the loss. There is no applicable statute.

The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her.

The man then e-mailed the nephew informing him of the arrangement. Shortly thereafter, the nephew died testate. In his will, he devised the farm to his daughter.

The buyer purchased a title insurance policy running to both the buyer and the bank, showing no liens on the property other than the buyer's mortgage to the bank. Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances. As a result of a title examiner's negligence, this mortgage was not disclosed in the title insurance policy issued to the buyer and the bank. Following this discovery, the donee successfully sued the buyer to recover the amount of the outstanding mortgage. If the buyer sues the title insurance company to recover the amount he paid to the donee, is he likely to prevail?",

        "question": "  Under the terms of his duly probated will, a testator devised his house to his \"grandchildren in fee simple\" and the residue of his estate to his brother. The testator had had two children, a son and a daughter, but only the daughter survived the testator. At the time of the testator's death, the daughter was 30 years old and had two minor children (grandchildren of the testator) who also survived the testator. A third grandchild of the testator, who was the child of the testator's predeceased son, had been alive when the testator executed the will, but had predeceased the testator. Under the applicable intestate succession laws, the deceased grandchild's sole heir was his mother. A statute of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \"If a devisee, including a devisee of a class gift, who is a grandparent or a lineal descendant of a grandparent of the testator is dead at the time of execution of the will or fails to survive the testator, the issue of such deceased devisee shall take the deceased's share under the will, unless the will expressly provides that this statute shall not apply.

The wife later removed a light fixture in the dining room of the house and replaced it with a chandelier that was one of her family heirlooms. She then informed her nephew and her late husband's son that after her death, the chandelier should be removed from the dining room and replaced with the former light fixture, which she had stored in the basement. The wife died and under her will bequeathed her entire estate to her nephew. She also named the nephew as the personal representative of her estate. After the nephew, in his capacity as personal representative, removed the chandelier and replaced it with the original light fixture shortly after the wife's death, the son sued to have the chandelier reinstalled. Who will likely prevail?",
