        "question": "The constitution of a state authorizes a five-member state reapportionment board to redraw state legislative districts every ten years. In the last state legislative reapportionment, the board, by a unanimous vote, divided the greater metropolitan area, composed of a large city and several contiguous townships, into three equally populated state legislative districts. The result of that districting was that 40% of the area's total black population resided in one of those districts, 45% of the area's total black population resided in the second of those districts, and 15% resided in the third district. A registered voter, who is black and is a resident of the city, brings suit in an appropriate court against the members of the state reapportionment board, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that would require the boundary lines of the state legislative districts in the greater metropolitan area be redrawn. His only claim is that the current reapportionment violates the Fifteenth Amendment because it improperly dilutes the voting power of the blacks who reside in that area. If no federal statute is applicable, which of the following facts, if proven, would most strongly support the validity of the action of the state reapportionment board?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. In drawing the current district lines, the reapportionment board precisely complied with state constitutional requirements that state legislative districts be compact and follow political subdivision boundaries to the maximum extent feasible.",
            "optionB": "B. The reapportionment board was composed of three white members and two black members and both of the board's black members were satisfied that its plan did not improperly dilute the voting power of the blacks who reside in that area.",
            "optionC": "C. Although the rate of voter registration among blacks is below that of voter registrations among whites in the greater metropolitan area, two black legislators have been elected from that area during the last 15 years.",
            "optionD": "D. The total black population of the greater metropolitan area amounts to only 15% of the population that is required to comprise a single legislative district."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. Race cannot be the predominant factor in drawing the boundaries of a voting district unless the district plan can survive a strict scrutiny review. Although the strange shape of a district is not necessary for strict scrutiny to apply, a district's bizarre shape can be used to show that race was the predominant factor in drawing the district's boundaries. Answer A provides the strongest support for the validity for the argument because it provides an alternate reasoning for the redistricting in which race is not a predominate factor, and would not trigger strict scrutiny. Answers B, C, and D fail to provide any evidence that race was not the predominate factor in redrawing the state legislative districts. Answer B is not correct because the racial makeup of the reapportionment committee does not indicate that race was not used to redraw the voting districts. C is incorrect because the racial makeup of elected legislators does not indicate that race was not used to redraw the voting districts. Answer D is not correct because the small size of the black population does not indicate that race was not used to redraw the voting districts. Thus, B, C, and D are incorrect."

        "question": "A state has a statute providing that an unsuccessful candidate in a primary election for a party's nomination for elected public office may not become a candidate for the same office at the following general election by nominating petition or by write-in votes. A woman sought her party's nomination for governor in the May primary election. After losing in the primary, the woman filed nominating petitions containing the requisite number of signatures to become a candidate for the office of governor in the following general election. The chief elections officer of the state refused to certify the woman's petitions solely because of the above statute. The woman then filed suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of this state statute. As a matter of Constitutional_law, which of the following is the proper burden of persuasion in this suit?",

Candidate qualifications need to be narrowly tailored to protect a compelling state interest to not violate equal protection or the First Amendment right of association, and the state has the burden to prove that its regulation meets strict scrutiny. A is incorrect because for strict scrutiny, the burden is not on the individual, but rather on the state. B is incorrect because rational basis would not apply, since a fundamental right is at issue. D is incorrect because rational basis doesn't apply, and if it did, the plaintiff would have the burden under it."

        "question": "While the defendant was in jail on a pending charge, his landlord called the police because rent had not been paid and because he detected a disagreeable odor coming from the defendant's apartment into the hallways. The police officer who responded to the call knew that the defendant was in jail. He recognized the stench coming from the defendant's apartment as that of decomposing flesh and, without waiting to obtain a warrant and using the landlord's passkey, entered the apartment with the landlord's consent. The lease to these premises gave the landlord a right of entry, at any reasonable hour, for the purpose of making repairs. The police officer found a large trunk in the bedroom which seemed to be the source of the odor. Upon breaking it open, he found the remains of the defendant's former mistress.

A is incorrect because the injury for standing has to be to the expectation of privacy, not just to the damage the seized items could do. C is incorrect because the landlord could not waive the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. D is incorrect because even though he was not there and had not paid rent, he still had a privacy interest in the apartment."

A is incorrect because there is not a sufficiently close correlation between citizenship and language proficiency to satisfy strict scrutiny.

The employee's sister ran in a recent election against the incumbent mayor, but she lost. The employee had supported his sister in the election campaign. After the mayor found out about this, she fired the employee solely because his support for the sister indicated that he was \"disloyal\" to the mayor.

Because the city's charter provides that \"all employees of the city work at the pleasure of the mayor,\" the clerical employee does not have a property interest in his employment. Nevertheless, the mayor's action is unconstitutional, because it violates the employee's right to freedom of expression and association protected by the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the government may not fire an employee because of the employee's political views or affiliations unless certain political views or affiliations are required for the effective performance of the employee's job. The political views or affiliations of a clerical employee of a city water department are not relevant to the employee's job, and thus the employee may not be fired because of them. B is correct.

The political views or affiliations of a clerical employee of a city water department are not relevant to the employee's job, and thus the employee may not be fired because of them. C is incorrect. It is true that the employee has no property interest in his job, and therefore he is not entitled to the constitutional protections of procedural due process. Nevertheless, the mayor's action is unconstitutional, because it violates the employee's right to freedom of expression and association protected by the First Amendment.

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. The U.S. Supreme Court held, in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), that the equal protection principles of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to actions of the federal government through the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The new security measures presumptively violate equal protection because they contain a racial classification: the new security measures apply only to individuals of one race. A court therefore would uphold the new security measures only if the government could prove that they are necessary to serve a compelling public interest, a standard that the government typically cannot meet. Thus, B is correct. A is incorrect. The commerce clause grants Congress plenary power to regulate the safety of air travel because airlines are instrumentalities of interstate commerce. C is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV prohibits actions by states that improperly discriminate against the citizens of other states. The clause does not apply to actions of the federal government. D is incorrect. The privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from depriving individuals of the privileges or immunities of United States citizenship. The U.S. Supreme Court has never applied the clause to actions of the federal government."

The fire was extinguished before it caused any other damage. The protester was arrested and charged with violating a state law that prohibited igniting a fire in a public building. He claimed that his prosecution was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. May the protester constitutionally be convicted?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because he was exercising his right to freedom of speech by burning a copy of the code.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because the copy of the code belonged to him, and thus burning it did not infringe upon a legitimate government interest.",
            "optionC": "C. Yes, because the burning of the code was conduct rather than speech.",
            "optionD": "D. Yes, because the state law is narrowly drawn to further a substantial government interest in prohibiting the noncommunicative aspects of the act in question."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. The protester's burning of the tax code qualifies as expressive conduct protected by the free speech clause of the First Amendment because (1) the protester intended to communicate a message and (2) the audience was likely to understand the communication. But because the state's interest underlying the law that the protester violated (preventing the burning of public buildings) is unrelated to the message communicated by the burning of the tax code, a court will not subject the state law to strict scrutiny. Instead, the court will uphold application of the law to the protester if the law is narrowly tailored to further a substantial government interest, a standard of justification that this law should satisfy easily. Thus, D is correct. A is incorrect. It is correct that the protester's burning of the tax code qualifies as expressive conduct protected by the free speech clause of the First Amendment. However, as stated above, the statue under which the protester will be convicted is not aimed at curbing free speech. Thus, the mere fact that the protester engaged in an act of free speech will not prevent a prosecution under the statute. Likewise, C is incorrect. Regardless of whether the protester's actions are characterized as conduct or speech, the applicable statute in this case is not designed to deter free speech. B is incorrect. The legitimacy (and substantiality) of the government's interest in preventing the burning of public buildings is not undermined by the fact that the protester burned his own copy of the tax code."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. Regulations on access to the ballot must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest. Therefore, if the objectives of the statute could be satisfactorily achieved by less burdensome means, the statute is not narrowly tailored. A is incorrect because a statute may be burdensome and still pass heightened scrutiny as long as it is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest. C is incorrect because the fact that fewer candidates from one political party make it onto the ballot is irrelevant if the requirement is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest. D is incorrect because limiting the ballot to only those candidates who have strong support might be a compelling government interest."

(2) Salary supplements can be paid to teachers in public and private schools, up to ten percent of existing salary schedules, where present compensation is less than the average salary for persons of comparable training and experience, provided that no such supplement is paid to any teacher who instructs in religious subjects. (3) Construction grants can be made toward the cost of physical plant at private colleges and universities, provided that no part of the grant is used for buildings in which instruction in religious subject matters is offered.

While taxpayers generally lack standing to challenge general spending statutes, a tax payer will have standing where the spending violates the Establishment Clause.

A is incorrect because taxpayers generally do not have standing to challenge governmental expenditures.

        "explanation": "A is correct. The text of the exceptions clause of Article III does not limit congressional power to strip the U.S. Supreme Court of its appellate jurisdiction to hear particular types of cases, and the Court's own decisions arguably support the view that the exceptions clause grants Congress this power. Thus, A is correct. B is incorrect. While it is true that criminal matters are traditionally governed by state law, a decision of the highest court of a state in a criminal case is subject to appellate review in the U.S. Supreme Court if the case includes a claim arising under federal law or if the case otherwise is within the federal judicial power. C is incorrect. A habeas corpus petition is not a means of direct federal judicial review of a state criminal case but rather constitutes a separate civil suit for the release of a prisoner who has been unlawfully imprisoned. D is incorrect. While it is true that the review of state court judgments is not within the original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court can review such judgments by exercising its appellate jurisdiction."

        "question": "A federal statute prohibits the construction of nuclear energy plants without a license from the Federal Nuclear Plant Siting Commission. The statute provides that the Commission may issue a license authorizing the construction of a proposed nuclear energy plant 30 days after the Commission makes a finding that the plant will comply with specified standards of safety, technological and commercial feasibility, and public convenience. In a severable provision, the Commission's enabling statute also provides that the Congress, by simple majorities in each house, may veto the issuance of a particular license by the Commission if such a veto occurs within 30 days following the required Commission finding. Early last year, the Commission found that a particular energy company, met all statutory requirements and, therefore, voted to issue the energy company a license authorizing it to construct a nuclear energy plant. Because they believed that the issuance of a license to the energy company was not in accord with the applicable statutory criteria, a majority of each of the two houses of Congress voted, within the specified 30-day period, to veto the license. On the basis of that veto, the Commission refused to issue the license. Subsequently, the energy company sued the Commission in an appropriate federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the Commission's refusal to issue the license. In this suit, the court should hold the congressional veto of the license of the energy company to be",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. invalid, because any determination by Congress that particular agency action does not satisfy statutory criteria violates Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution because it constitutes the performance of a judicial function by the legislative branch.",
            "optionB": "B. invalid, because Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution has been interpreted to mean that any action of Congress purporting to alter the legal rights of persons outside of the legislative branch must be presented to the President for his signature or veto.",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. Article I, \u00a7 7, cl. 3 of the United States Constitution provides that any matter that the houses of Congress can accomplish by majority vote must be presented to the President for signature or veto before it can have effect. As part of our system of checks and balances, Congress can act alone, without the assistance of the Executive Branch when the Constitution allows it, and the Constitution allows Congress to act alone only when it can command a super-majority. A is incorrect because Congress isn't reviewing the decision of the agency; rather, Congress is part of the system deciding whether to issue the license at all. C is incorrect because, although Congress does have authority under the Commerce clause to regulate the construction of nuclear energy plants, its action in acting by majority vote alone was not valid. Similarly, answer D is incorrect because Congress may have a compelling interest in regulating nuclear siting for public health and safety, but its actions were invalid because it cannot act alone without a super-majority. Additionally, Congress would not have needed a compelling state interest to regulate nuclear siting, because the facts present no deprivation of a fundamental right or classification based on a protected class."

        "question": "A state grand jury investigating a murder learned that the key suspect might have kept a diary. The grand jury issued a subpoena duces tecum requiring the suspect to produce any diary. The subpoena made clear that the grand jury was seeking only the diary and not any testimony from the suspect. The suspect refused to produce the diary, citing the privilege against self-incrimination. Under what circumstances, if any, may the grand jury compel production of the diary over the suspect's assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. It may compel production without granting immunity because the suspect was not compelled to write a diary.",
            "optionB": "B. It may compel production only if the suspect is granted use and derivative use immunity from the act of production.",
            "optionC": "C. It may compel production only if the suspect is granted transactional immunity.",
            "optionD": "D. It may not compel production of a private diary under any circumstances."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination protects only testimonial or communicative evidence, and not real or physical evidence. Therefore, it protects acts of production that would have testimonial significance by authenticating documents. Thus, A is incorrect. However, a criminal defendant may be compelled to produce documents that have testimonial significance if immunity is granted to the defendant. There are two kinds of immunity that may be granted. The broader form of immunity is \"transactional immunity.\" Transactional immunity completely protects the witness from future prosecution for crimes related to his or her testimony. \"Use and derivative use\" immunity is narrower--it prevents the prosecution only from using the witness's own testimony or any evidence derived from the testimony against the witness. However, should the prosecutor acquire evidence substantiating the supposed crime--independently of the witness's testimony--the witness may then be prosecuted for the same. Here, B is correct because use and derivative use immunity sufficiently protects the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in this situation. Thus, C is incorrect because the prosecution does not need to grant the suspect transactional immunity--use and derivative use immunity sufficiently protects the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. D is incorrect because the suspect's privilege against self-incrimination may be overcome if the suspect is granted use and derivative use immunity."

The prosecutor advised the witness that he had a Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify if he so chose. The witness asked that his attorney be allowed to advise him inside the grand jury room, but the prosecutor refused to allow the attorney inside. After speaking with his attorney outside the grand jury room, the witness decided to testify. During his testimony, he made self-incriminating statements. The witness was subsequently indicted for drug crimes. The indictment was based on the witness's grand jury testimony and on evidence seized in an unconstitutional search of the witness's home. The witness has moved to dismiss the indictment. Should the court dismiss the indictment?",

            "optionC": "C. No, because the witness waived his constitutional rights by testifying.",
            "optionD": "D. No, because the witness had no right to counsel inside the grand jury room and the illegally seized evidence did not affect the validity of the indictment."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. A grand jury witness does not have a constitutional right to counsel inside a grand jury room. See Connecticut v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 292 (1999) (citing United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564 (1976)). Thus, A is incorrect. Also, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to federal grand juries and is not a basis upon which a federal indictment can be dismissed. United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338 (1974). Thus, B is incorrect, and D is correct. C is incorrect. The issue here does not turn on waiver, nor do the facts demonstrate a waiver of any constitutional rights.

        "question": "A defendant was charged with the capital offense of first-degree murder, for which the only available penalties were death or life in prison without parole. During jury selection, the trial court, over the defendant's objection, granted the prosecution's for-cause challenge of five prospective jurors who indicated upon questioning by both parties that they personally were opposed to the death penalty and were unsure if they could ever vote to impose it. The jury convicted the defendant and, following a separate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death. On appeal, the defendant's only argument was that excusing the prospective jurors violated his federal constitutional right to be tried by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of the community.

A trial court properly may excuse a juror for cause from serving in both the guilt and penalty phases of a capital case if a juror's views regarding the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the juror from impartially deciding whether the death penalty is warranted in that particular case. Exclusion of such jurors does not violate the fair cross-section right of the Sixth Amendment. To establish such a violation, the defendant must show the underrepresentation of a distinct and numerically significant group in the venire to show his jury trial right was violated.

A few minutes later, two police officers saw a pickup truck fitting the description a half block from the high school. The driver of the truck matched the description of one of the men described by the undercover officer. The only passenger was a young woman who was in the back of the truck. The police saw her get out and stand at a nearby bus stop. They stopped the truck and searched the driver. In the pocket of the driver's jacket, the police found a small bottle of pills that they recognized as narcotics. They then broke open a locked toolbox attached to the flatbed of the truck and found a small sealed envelope inside. They opened it and found marijuana. They also found a quantity of cocaine in the glove compartment. After completing their search of the driver and the truck, the police went over to the young woman and searched her purse.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. Under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, the police may properly search a vehicle, including any containers contained therein, that might contain the evidence they seek without first obtaining a warrant. Therefore, if the police have reason to believe there is illegal contraband in the car, they can search the entire car for the contraband. Here, a police officer reported that the driver of the vehicle was selling marijuana, and gave a description of the truck and the driver. This information gave the two police officers the probable cause needed to search a vehicle matching the description. The automobile exception allows the warrantless search of the vehicle, of any container in the vehicle which may contain the evidence sought, and the belongings of the people inside the vehicle. The police were thus constitutionally permitted to search the glove compartment, the locked toolbox, and the sealed envelope for more evidence of marijuana. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because the automobile exception allows for a warrantless search of the entire car and any compartment that might contain the marijuana as long as there is probable cause for the search."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. The exclusionary rule is a rule meant to deter police conduct that would violate the protections afforded to the accused in the Constitution, and suppressing the evidence in this case would serve no purpose in enforcing those constitutional rights. Because there was no coercive police conduct in obtaining the man's statement, the statement should not be suppressed, and the confession is admissible. B is incorrect because it ignores the non-coercive effect of the police conduct, and the man may well have been in custody at the time of the interrogation. C is incorrect because the scope of the exclusionary rule does not include the right of the defendant to confess to a crime only when totally rational and properly motivated. There must be some type of coercive police activity necessary to find that the man's confession was not voluntary and inadmissible. D is incorrect because the protections of Miranda, as well as the exclusionary rule, will only apply to cases involving police misconduct; the confession was voluntarily given here.

If all the evidence is in and the issue is balanced in the mind of the jury, then the party with the burden of persuasion must lose. In a criminal prosecution, each element of a crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, the prosecution must prove three things: (1) that the man had sexual intercourse with a woman (2) who was not his wife and (3) without her consent. All three must be proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, and this burden of persuasion will not be shifted onto the defendant. Therefore, the burden of persuasion about whether the woman was the man's wife must be on the prosecution, and the judge's instruction to the contrary was a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights. A jury instruction that places the burden of persuasion on the defendant regarding an affirmative defense, in this case regarding the man's reasonable belief that the woman had consented, is not improper and does not violate the man's constitutional rights. Therefore, placing the burden on the defendant to show that he reasonably believed that the woman had consented would not violate his constitutional rights. A is incorrect because placing the burden on the man to persuade the jury that he had a reasonable belief of consent does not go to the elements of the charge of rape and instead is an affirmative defense.

One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to the suspect's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to the suspect's house. The police knocked on the suspect's door and called out, \"Police. Open up. We have a search warrant.\" After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found the suspect with a large brown suitcase and put handcuffs on the suspect.

A deputy tackled him just as he entered the barn. As the rival attempted to get up, the deputy pinned his arms behind his back. Another deputy threatened, \"Tell us what you did with the marijuana farmer or we will shut you down and see your family on relief.\" The rival responded that he had killed the marijuana farmer in a fight but did not report the incident because he did not want authorities to enter his land and discover his marijuana crop. Instead, he buried him behind the barn. The rival was thereafter charged with murder.

The fields around the rival's farmhouse are considered held out to the public under the \"open fields\" doctrine, so the rival did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in them or in the scarecrow on which the victim's clothes were hanging. Because the fields were not protected by the Fourth Amendment, the police officers' search did not violate the rival's constitutional rights. The rival's motion to suppress should be denied. A is incorrect because the rival had no reasonable expectation of privacy in lands visible to the public, and the police officer's did not need to obtain a warrant to see the evidence. B is incorrect because it is a misstatement of the relevant law regarding search and seizure; answer B refers to the rival's right to due process of law, whereas search and seizure law is covered by the fourth amendment. D is incorrect because actual ownership of the searched or seized property is not the deciding factor in determining the propriety of the search. Because the clothing was on the rival's land when the search and seizure occurred, the fact that it belonged to somebody else is irrelevant. Therefore, because the rival did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the lands around his farmhouse, the clothing should not be suppressed."

        "question": "Police received information from an undercover police officer that she had just seen two men (whom she described) in a red pickup truck selling marijuana to schoolchildren near the city's largest high school. A few minutes later, two police officers saw a pickup truck fitting the description a half block from the high school. The driver of the truck matched the description of one of the men described by the undercover officer. The only passenger was a young woman who was in the back of the truck. The police saw her get out and stand at a nearby bus stop. They stopped the truck and searched the driver. In the pocket of the driver's jacket, the police found a small bottle of pills that they recognized as narcotics. They then broke open a locked toolbox attached to the flatbed of the truck and found a small sealed envelope inside. They opened it and found marijuana. They also found a quantity of cocaine in the glove compartment. After completing their search of the driver and the truck, the police went over to the young woman and searched her purse.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. Under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, the police may properly search a vehicle, including any containers contained therein, that might contain the evidence they seek without first obtaining a warrant. Therefore, if the police have reason to believe there is illegal contraband in the car, they can search the entire car for the contraband. Here, a police officer reported that the driver of the vehicle was selling marijuana, and gave a description of the truck and the driver. This information gave the two police officers the probable cause needed to search a vehicle matching the description. The automobile exception allows the warrantless search of the vehicle, of any container in the vehicle which may contain the evidence sought, and the belongings of the people inside the vehicle. The police were thus constitutionally permitted to search the glove compartment, the locked toolbox, and the sealed envelope for more evidence of marijuana. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because the automobile exception allows for a warrantless search of the entire car and any compartment that might contain the marijuana as long as there is probable cause for the search."

The defendant's motion to prevent introduction of the marijuana into evidence will most probably be",

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. The defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his back yard and porch, and the police, by entering the porch with the dogs, were conducting an illegal, warrantless search. The defendant's motion to exclude the evidence should be granted. A is incorrect because the arrest was not valid; the defendant was arrested due to the illegal, warrantless search. Furthermore, a search incident to arrest is limited to the defendant and the area within his immediate control. In this case, the evidence was found in a linen closet in the defendant's residence after the defendant had been placed under arrest. This exceeded the scope of a valid search incident to an arrest. B is incorrect because permitting police officers to enter a residence does not allow the police to search the entire residence. The police officers would have needed to obtain the consent to search as well as the consent to enter if the evidence was not in plain sight. Since the evidence was in a closet and no consent to search was given, the evidence should be excluded.

The records sought were the records of the bank, not the defendant, and the Supreme Court has held that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the bank records of their account. See U.S. v. Miller. A is incorrect because, since there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in records that belong to the bank, there is no constitutional requirement that the police obtain a search warrant before the records can be seized. B is incorrect because the period of time of the records seized is of little or no relevance to the determination of the propriety of the seizure itself. Because the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his bank records, obtaining those records, even for the previous two years, did not violate his rights. Answer C is incorrect because it misstates the reason the records can be seized. There were no exigent circumstances to authorize the seizure of the bank records.

The jury acquitted the defendant of attempted rape but convicted him of assault. While he was serving his sentence for assault, the victim, who had never recovered from the coma, died.

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. The attempted rape charge cannot be the basis for the felony-murder charge because the defendant has been acquitted of the charge and to use it would violate the double jeopardy clause. The double jeopardy clause forbids the state from prosecuting, or punishing, a defendant twice for the same action. In this case, the defendant was placed in jeopardy during the original trial for attempted rape, and to use that charge again as the underlying felony in a felony murder charge would put him in jeopardy again. Assault, at common law, is not a felony and cannot be used as the basis for a felony-murder charge. B is incorrect because it is the acquittal on the attempted rape charge that violates the defendant's rights under the double jeopardy clause and not the conviction of the assault charge. C is incorrect because the defendant is charged with felony murder based on the felony of attempted rape. He has been placed in jeopardy already for the attempted rape. Although the prosecutor may proceed on a different theory of murder, proceeding on a felony-murder charge with the underlying felony being attempted rape would violate double jeopardy. Answer D is incorrect because the conviction on the assault charge ignores the acquittal on the felony charge of attempted rape, which is the basis for the felony murder charge. The conviction for one of the charged offenses does not mean that the defendant was not subject to jeopardy on the other charge that he was acquitted of. Because the defendant was already placed in jeopardy for the attempted rape charge, it cannot be used as the basis of a new charge of felony murder."

At trial, an expert witness testified for the defense that the defendant, an athlete, was under the influence of a performance-enhancing drug at the time he committed the battery and that he would not have done so had he not been so influenced. The defendant asked for an instruction to the effect that if the jury believed that he was influenced by the drug at the time of the crime and would not have committed it otherwise, it had to acquit him. Which of the following circumstances would most aid the defendant's argument in favor of such an instruction?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another resulting in either an offensive touching or bodily injury. Battery is also a general intent crime. \"General intent\" is an awareness of all the factors constituting the crime. Voluntary intoxication is not a valid defense to a general intent crime. Thus, the most helpful fact supporting an intoxication defense would be evidence that the intoxication was involuntary, which could be shown by evidence demonstrating that the defendant was tricked into taking a substance that he did not know was an intoxicant. B is correct. As stated above, voluntary intoxication would not be a defense to the crime of battery, and the fact that a defendant was addicted to a drug does not make intoxication with that drug involuntary for purposes of the Criminal_law. Thus, A is incorrect. Nor would the victim's taunting constitute a valid defense. The victim's taunting would not support an intoxication instruction, which would be proper only if there was evidence showing that the intoxication was involuntary. Thus, C is incorrect.

        "question": "A bartender is charged with the statutory offense of \"knowingly violating a regulation of the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board\" and that he knowingly violated regulation number 345-90 issued by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. That regulation prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of 18 and also prohibits the sale of any alcoholic beverage to a person over the age of 17 and under the age of 22 without the presentation of such person's driver's license or other identification showing the age of the purchaser to be 18 or older. The evidence showed that the bartender worked in a tavern and sold a bottle of beer to a person who was 17 years old and that the bartender did not ask for or see the purchaser's driver's license or any other identification. Which of the following, if found by the jury, would be of the most help to the bartender?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The purchaser had a driver's license that falsely showed his age to be 21.",
            "optionB": "B. The bartender had never been told he was supposed to check identification of persons over 17 and under 22 before selling them alcohol.",
            "optionC": "C. The bartender did not know that the regulations classified beer as an alcoholic beverage.",
            "optionD": "D. The bartender mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. The regulation stating that bartenders must require people between the ages of 18 and 21 to show identification of their age carries with it the implication that people above the age of 21 are not required to show identification. The bartender's best argument is that, since he mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old, he was allowed to sell them beer and was not required to obtain identification; in relying on that statute, he did not ascertain the minor's age. This may allow him to argue that the regulation contains a mens rea element requiring that he knowingly violate the law. Because the bartender did not knowingly sell alcohol to the minor, he should be acquitted. A is incorrect because the fact that the purchaser could have presented a fake identification does not excuse the bartender's not asking to see it; his only legitimate excuse would be that he believed the person to be over 21 and that the statute includes a mens rea requirement. B is incorrect because ignorance of the law is generally not an excuse, and the bartender's not being told that he has to check identification does not affect the offense's mens rea requirement. When a crime requires that the defendant act knowingly, he must have been aware that his conduct was of a particular nature, or at least know that his conduct will necessarily or very likely cause a particular result. Here, he must have been aware of the fact that he was selling to a minor, or to someone between the ages of 18 and 21, not the fact that his conduct was violating that regulation. C is incorrect because, again, ignorance of the law is no excuse, and not knowing that beer is an alcoholic beverage does not excuse the bartender's actions. If the jury found that the bartender mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24-years-old, the bartender could argue that he relied on the statute's requiring identification from 18 to 21 year olds, and thus did not meet the mens rea requirement of the regulation."

Proof of malice does not need to be proof of an actual specific intent to kill or harm another; it can be implied from a defendant's gross recklessness with regard to human life shown. In this case, the homeowner fired a shotgun into bushes where he believed people were hiding. This action would support a finding of malice. The shooting caused the child to lose his sight, which is a serious injury. Therefore, the homeowner is guilty of second- degree assault. A is incorrect because the child's status as a trespasser does not automatically allow the homeowner to inflict serious bodily harm. In addition, the homeowner's belief that the force would be non-deadly would not negate the finding that he acted maliciously. B is incorrect because a finding of malice does not require the intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury. Malice can also be shown by the homeowner acting extremely recklessly with regard to human life. D is incorrect because it is a misstatement of the law regarding the use of force.

Although for public policy concerns we impose punishment without mens rea, the punishment is usually lighter than that for a crime where intent, recklessness, or knowledge has been proved.

The defendant's pointing a loaded weapon at the victim and pulling the trigger posed a great threat of serious bodily injury to the victim, and, because it resulted in the victim's death, the defendant should be convicted of murder in the second degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with malice aforethought, done without premeditation and deliberation. The defendant's actions were done with reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life, and will support a finding of malice aforethought. A is incorrect because there is no evidence that the defendant intended to kill the victim. Because the statute defines first degree murder as the premeditated and intentional killing of another, and there is no evidence that the defendant intended to kill the victim, she will not be convicted of murder in the first degree. In addition, answer A is also incorrect because the underlying felony in a felony murder charge must be sufficiently independent of the actual killing. In this case, the underlying felony of assault with a deadly weapon would merge into the homicide charge and would not be independent enough to allow for a proper felony murder charge. The defendant cannot be properly convicted of first degree murder under either theory. C is incorrect because manslaughter is not the most serious crime for which the defendant can properly be convicted. In addition, the defendant's actions were beyond mere negligence, and the killing of the victim was done with malice aforethought. The defendant should be convicted of murder in the second degree. D is incorrect because a victim's voluntarily playing the game and his assumption of risk are irrelevant to the determination of criminal responsibility.

Enraged, the man said, \"What am I going to do?\" The teller said, \"If it were my wife, I'd just march into his office and blow his brains out.\" The man grabbed a revolver and rushed to the bank. He walked into the bank, carrying the gun in his hand. One of the security guards, believing a holdup was about to occur, shot and killed the man. If charged with murder of the man, the teller should be found",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. guilty, based upon extreme recklessness.",
            "optionB": "B. guilty, based upon transferred intent.",
            "optionC": "C. not guilty, because he did not intend for the man to be shot by the security guard.",
            "optionD": "D. not guilty, because he did not shoot the man, and he was not acting in concert with the security guard."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Malice does not require the intent to kill; in some cases, there may be \"implied malice\" if there was gross or extreme recklessness to human life on the part of the defendant. In the question, the teller, knowing the man to be violent and jealous, lied to him, and suggested he commit murder. By taking actions that ensured the man would be walking into a heavily guarded bank with a gun, the teller acted with extreme recklessness; this is enough to show implied malice aforethought. Therefore, the teller should be found guilty of murder. An additional facet of the question raises the issue of whether the teller was a \"proximate cause\" of the man's death. The general test is whether the death was foreseeable; a defendant will be held criminally liable for the foreseeable consequences of their actions. In this case, by ensuring the man would enter a heavily guarded bank with the intent to kill the president and armed with a gun, it was foreseeable that the man would be killed. B is incorrect because transferred intent does not apply in cases where the actor doing the killing is different than the one who has the intent to kill the president. The teller's intent to kill the president will not transfer to the security guard's' action of killing the man. C is incorrect because the \"implied malice\" doctrine does not require that the teller have the intent that the man be killed; it is sufficient that the death of the man was a foreseeable result of the actions the teller put into motion, and that those actions were taken with extreme recklessness. Answer D is incorrect because the charge does not require that the teller be the one to shoot the man or that he act in concert with the security guard. Because the teller proximately caused the death of the man and did so with malice aforethought, the teller should be found guilty of murder."

He overheard a customer on the next barstool telling the bartender how it was necessary for companies to downsize in order to keep the economy strong. The man turned to the customer and said, \"Why don't you shut the hell up.\" The customer responded, \"This is a free country, and I can say what I want,\" all the while shaking his finger at the man. The man became enraged, snatched his revolver from his pocket, and shot the customer, killing him. A state statute defines first-degree murder as \"knowingly causing the death of another person after deliberation upon the matter.\" Deliberation is defined as \"cool reflection for any length of time, no matter how brief.\" Second-degree murder is defined as \"knowingly causing the death of another person.\" Manslaughter is defined as at common law.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. The bar patron's best argument for acquittal is that, because the accident would have occurred even if the bar patron had not been intoxicated, his reckless action giving rise to the manslaughter charge was not a cause in fact ('but for' cause) of the other driver's death. Because the action that the bar patron took was not a cause in fact, he cannot be convicted of manslaughter. A is incorrect because contributory negligence is a civil issue and does not apply to criminal manslaughter cases. C is incorrect because voluntary intoxication is only a defense to specific intent crimes, not to crimes involving criminal negligence, such as manslaughter. The bar patron's argument that he was too intoxicated to be criminally negligent will not succeed. D is incorrect because the argument that the bar patron did not commit manslaughter by virtue of there being no underlying misdemeanor ignores the possibility that the bar patron committed manslaughter by virtue of carrying out a criminally negligent act. Answer D is an ineffective defense. The bar patron's best chance for acquittal is to argue that, because the collision would have occurred even if the bar patron had not been intoxicated, the criminally negligent acts he took were not the cause in fact of the death."

An attempt charge requires that the defendant have the intent to commit the crime and that the defendant take substantial steps toward the commission of the crime. The man did not have the intent to commit rape in the second degree, and therefore, should be found not guilty. A is incorrect because, although the charge of rape in the second degree does not require the man to know that the girl is under the age of 16, he cannot be found to have committed attempted rape because he did not have the requisite intent to commit the crime. Attempt is a specific intent crime. Even if the underlying crime has a lesser mens rea requirement, the man cannot be convicted of attempt without having the specific intent that rape in the second degree be committed. B is incorrect because it ignores the specific intent requirement for an attempt charge and instead addresses the issue of whether or not the man committed a \"substantial step\" toward the commission of the offense. However, he cannot be convicted of rape in the second degree even if he is found to have committed a substantial step toward it, because he lacked the requisite mental state.

Case A illustrates the rule that a defendant is guilty as an accomplice if he provides an individual with aid in committing an offense and the assistance could not be for a legitimate purpose. In this case the surgeon is removing the fingerprints from a known safecracker. Therefore, the surgeon has given substantial aid to the burglary and the surgeon can be convicted on the authority of case A. Case B illustrates the rule that a defendant who provides substantial encouragement or assistance to an unwitting third-person in the commission of a crime will be liable as an accomplice to the crime.

A minor, who was sixteen years old, but looked four or five years older, entered a store and asked a clerk for a box of .22 caliber shells. The store owner had instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors. The clerk asked the minor his age. The minor said he was twenty. The clerk then placed a box of shells on the counter and asked, \"Anything else?\" The minor said that was all he wanted but then discovered he did not have enough money to pay for the shells, so the clerk put the box back onto the shelf.

In this case, the clerk did not have the intent to sell ammunition to minors, and the store owner, as his accessory, should be found not guilty of attempting to sell ammunition to minors. A is incorrect because it was not, in fact, impossible for the offense to occur and only legal impossibility is a defense to an attempt charge. Although the sale of the ammunition was not completed, that is insufficient for a showing of impossibility, and factual impossibility is not a defense to an attempt charge. B is incorrect because, even though she instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors, the crime is one of strict liability. For strict liability crimes, it does not matter what the store owner's, or the clerk's as her agent, state of mind was. If they sold ammunition to a minor, they would be guilty of the offense. However, for a charge of attempt, there must exist the intent to commit the offense. C is incorrect because, once again, the crime is one of strict liability. The minor's lie about his age, the clerk's belief of his age, or whether that belief was reasonable, are all irrelevant for strict liability offenses.

In any event, payment for the drugs likely would qualify as an overt act in jurisdictions imposing such a requirement. C is incorrect. Plurality of agreement is required unless the question specifically states that the jurisdiction follows the Modern Penal Code's unilateral approach to conspiracy. Because the undercover officer was feigning his agreement to purchase and sell the heroin, there was no plurality of agreement and thus no conspiracy. D is incorrect.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. The man attempted to take the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, by the threat of force. The man had the intent to commit a robbery, and took substantial steps, by putting his hand in his pocket and threatening the attendant, toward the commission of that robbery. Although it was factually impossible for the man to have committed robbery, because the attendant was not afraid and gave the money to the man out of sympathy rather than because of force or the threat of force, factual impossibility is not a defense to an attempt charge. The man committed attempted robbery. A is incorrect because the man did not commit a robbery. The attendant did not give the man the money because of force or the threat of force, but rather because he felt sorry for the man. A conviction for robbery requires the money be given due to force or the threat of force, and not because of sympathy. C is incorrect because, at common law, false pretenses requires the obtaining of the possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation. Regardless of whether the check was properly endorsed, the man did not obtain the money through fraud, but rather through the sympathy of the attendant. Therefore, he did not commit false pretenses. D is incorrect for the same reason. At common law, larceny by trick is obtaining the possession, with the owner's consent, of the property of another by fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. The attendant did not give away the property because of misrepresentation, but rather sympathy. The man, however, did have the intent to commit a robbery, and took substantial steps towards the commission of the offense, and is most likely guilty of attempted robbery."

When one of the devices broke down and the speeder was arrested, he confessed that he often sped, secure in the knowledge that his \"SuperTrucker\" would warn him of police radar in the vicinity. Held: The defendant guilty as an accomplice to speeding. CASE B: The defendant told a man that the defendant had stored some stereo equipment in a self-storage locker. He gave the man a key and asked the man to pick up the equipment and deliver it to the defendant's house. The man complied, and removed the equipment from the locker, using the key. In fact, the equipment belonged to the defendant's neighbor, whose locker key the defendant had found in the driveway. Held: The defendant guilty as an accomplice to burglary. CASE C: A city council member accepted a bribe from the defendant in exchange for his vote on the defendant's application for a zoning variance. A statute prohibits the taking of bribes by public officials. Held: The defendant not guilty as an accomplice to the city council member's violation of the bribery statute.

            "optionD": "D. acquitted on the authority of Case D."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. Case C presents an instance where the person being charged as an accomplice is not the person the statute intended to penalize. If a statue defines a crime that necessarily involves more than one person and only provides for liability for one person, it is presumed that the legislative intent was to immunize the other person from liability as an accomplice. In case C, the statute prohibits the taking of bribes by a public official. Since the defendant was only a private person giving a bribe, he would not be guilty as an accomplice under the statute. In the present case, the college student is purchasing narcotics, but is being charged as an accomplice to the sale of narcotics. Therefore, the college student is not the person that the statute intends to target, and should be acquitted of the accomplice charge based on the authority of case C. Case A illustrates the rule that a defendant is guilty as an accomplice if he provides an individual with the means to commit an offense and the assistance could not be for a legitimate purpose. The college student did not assist in the sale of narcotics, so case A is not the proper authority. Case B illustrates the rule that a defendant who provides substantial encouragement or assistance to an unwitting third-person in the commission of a crime will be liable as an accomplice to the crime. The student did not sell narcotics through a third-person, so case B is not the proper authority. Case D illustrates the rule that a defendant would not be guilty as an accomplice for providing a means for an offense to occur when there is a legitimate purpose for providing the good or service. The college student did not assist in the sale of narcotics, and had no legitimate purpose for buying narcotics off the street, so case D is not the proper authority."

The owner gave the neighbor a key to use to check on the house. The neighbor decided to have a party in the owner's house. He invited a number of friends.

The neighbor is not guilty of any crime. The pickpocket, however, took the owner's property, without the owner's consent, and put them in his pocket, and is thus guilty of larceny. A is incorrect because neither the neighbor, nor the pickpocket, committed a burglary. At common law, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony therein. The neighbor had the owner's permission to be in the residence, and there is no evidence that the neighbor had the intent to commit a felony or theft in the residence. The neighbor is not guilty of burglary. Likewise, the pickpocket had permission to be in the residence and, since he was invited into the dwelling, there is no evidence that the pickpocket broke into the house. There is also no evidence that the pickpocket entered the party with the intent to commit a felony or a theft. B is incorrect because the neighbor did not commit a burglary and is not criminally responsible for the pickpocket's actions, because he did not have the intent that the larceny occur, and he did not knowingly aid and abet the pickpocket in the commission of the crime. However, the pickpocket did take, and carry away, the owner's rings, with the intent to deprive the owner of them, and is thus guilty of larceny. C is incorrect because the neighbor had permission to be in the residence by its owner. Trespass does not appear in the area of Criminal_law as a crime on its own, but as an element of other crimes, i.e. if a taking must be by trespass, then it must occur without the victim's consent. However, trespass is only a prima facie action by itself in torts. It is true that the neighbor likely committed that tort because having a party was likely outside the scope of the owner's consent. However, since trespass is generally a tort and not a crime, the neighbor committed no crime. The pickpocket is not guilty of trespass either. The pickpocket is guilty of larceny, but the neighbor committed no crime."

The defendant in answer C took the neighbor's dog with the intent to permanently deprive ownership. Mistake of law is not a defense to larceny, so the defendant will be found guilty. A is incorrect. Larceny is a specific intent crime. If the defendant did not have the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, the defendant cannot be found guilty of larceny. B is incorrect. If the defendant honestly believes that he is entitled to the money or property of another for the payment of a debt, then the defendant will not have the intent to take the property of another. The defendant in answer B believed he had a valid claim to the property, and thus lacked the requisite intent to commit larceny. D is incorrect. Larceny is a specific intent crime.

At his trial, the evidence established the following: A man and his wife were enjoying a drink at a tavern when the defendant entered and stood near the door. The wife whispered to her husband that the defendant was the man who had insulted her on the street the day before. The husband approached the defendant and said, \"Get out of here, or I'll break your nose.\" The defendant said, \"Don't come any closer, or I'll hurt you.\" When the husband raised his fists menacingly, the defendant pulled a can of pepper spray from his pocket, aimed it at the husband's face, and sprayed. The husband fell to the floor, writhing in pain. Should the defendant be convicted?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. The majority rule is that there is no duty to retreat prior to using deadly force. The non-aggressor may use deadly force in self-defense even if the use of deadly force could be avoided by retreating. However, the question states that the jurisdiction follows the \"retreat\" rule. In such a jurisdiction, a non-aggressor may use deadly force only after making a proper retreat. No retreat is necessary if it cannot be made in complete safety. Additionally, there is no obligation to retreat unless the defender intends to use deadly force. Here, the accused used pepper spray on the victim--a nondeadly force--and therefore there was no need to retreat. B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the defendant should not be convicted, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. The reason the defendant was not required to retreat was because he used nondeadly force and not because he was in an occupied structure. C is incorrect. As explained above, even where safe retreat is possible, it is not required before using nondeadly force in self-defense. D is incorrect. A response of nondeadly force is justified where the defender reasonably believes the other is about to inflict unlawful bodily harm, which need not be deadly harm."

A is incorrect. Even if the man were considered an alter ego of the homeowner, that would not be a defense to a charge of conspiracy. Conspiracy punishes the agreement, regardless of who has proposed it. Answer C is incorrect. In some states, conspiracy requires the commission of an overt act, and the actions taken here by the man and homeowner were sufficient.

        "explanation": "A is correct. Arson is not a specific intent crime; instead it requires malice on the part of the defendant. To establish malice in an arson case, the prosecution need only show that the defendant recklessly disregarded an obvious or high risk that the burning of the structure would occur. It is important to note that questions on the MBE that are testing on other arson issues (such as malice) will often impliedly follow the modern trend that the structure does not need to be the dwelling of another. Since the answer choices focus on intent, do not get hung up on the fact that the defendant's actions do not fall within the common law definition of arson. B is incorrect because negligence alone is insufficient proof of malicious burning. However, the defendant's recklessness, combined with the obvious risk of the burning, demonstrates malice. C is incorrect because arson requires only the malicious burning of the building, not the specific intent to burn the building down. Answer D is incorrect because the burning need not be intentional, as long as it is a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions. By allowing a minor fire that he started to spread throughout the building with the intent to destroy the building, the defendant maliciously burned the property and is guilty of arson."

B is incorrect because the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule only applies if the witness is available on the stand to testify as to the sketch.

At trial, the homeowner was prepared to testify that when she first detected the flooding, she turned off the water and called the plumber at his emergency number for help and that the plumber responded, \"I'll come by tomorrow and redo the installation for free.\" Is the homeowner's testimony regarding the plumber's response admissible?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. This is a party admission, admissible as a hearsay exemption under Rule 801(d)(2)(A). A statement made by a party cannot be excluded as hearsay when offered against him by the opponent. Moreover, the statement is probative. A person who makes a statement like this is likely to think he is at fault, and this is probative evidence that indeed he is at fault. Thus, D is correct, and B is incorrect, because the statement is not hearsay. A is incorrect. Federal Rule of Evidence 408 protects statements concerning a claim that is disputed as to validity or amount. However, in this case there was no pending dispute at the time the statement was made. The homeowner was simply calling for help and had not complained about the plumber's work or in any other way indicated that there was a dispute between the parties. Accordingly, the statement does not qualify as an offer in compromise. C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the statement is admissible, but it misstates the reason why this is so. Federal Rule of Evidence 407 excludes evidence of measures taken that, had they been taken prior to the event that caused the injury, would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur. Here, no \"measure\" was taken at all. The plaintiff wants to introduce a statement, not any action that would have made the injury less likely to occur. Therefore Rule 407 is inapplicable."

The witness has also testified that the tape recording is a record, which he adopted when the matter was fresh in his memory, in which the witness's knowledge of the license plate number is correctly contained. The tape recording is therefore admissible under the recorded recollection exception to the hearsay rule. B is incorrect because records of law enforcement personnel are generally not admissible against a criminal defendant. C is incorrect because the statement, although hearsay, is admissible under the prior recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule. D is incorrect because it is the witness who had first-hand knowledge of the license plate number, and he adopted his wife's statement immediately after it was made.

If a witness is declared hostile, the examining party may be allowed to examine the witness by leading questions. But a declaration that a witness is hostile does not mean that the cross-examination can go beyond the scope of direct examination. The rule governing the scope of cross-examination is the same for hostile and non-hostile witnesses. Thus, Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 611(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting credibility. Thus, A is correct.

C is incorrect because the burden of proof does not shift to the defendant; it remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast (the plaintiff in this case). The defendant does not need to persuade the jury of non-receipt. Answer D is incorrect because the rebuttal of a presumption does not require a finding for the rebutting party. In addition, the evidence that the notice was not received was contradicted by evidence of the properly mailed notice. The jury, as fact finder, may find the notice was received, but is not required to."

        "question": "A plaintiff sued a defendant for injuries allegedly suffered when he slipped and fell on the defendant's business property. At trial, without asking that the defendant's property manager be declared a hostile witness, the plaintiff called him solely to establish that the defendant was the owner of the property where the plaintiff fell. On cross- examination of the manager, the defendant's attorney sought to establish that the defendant had taken reasonable precautions to make the property safe for business invitees. Should the defendant's cross-examination of the manager be permitted over the plaintiff's objection?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because the court has not declared the manager hostile.",
            "optionC": "C. Yes, because the cross-examiner is entitled to explore matters relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.",
            "optionD": "D. Yes, because the manager is the agent of a party, as to whom the scope of cross-examination is unlimited."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. This is a correct statement of the scope of cross-examination, as set forth by Rule 611(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, in the absence of any permission by the court to inquire into other matters. If a witness is declared hostile, the examining party may be allowed to examine the witness by leading questions. But a declaration that a witness is hostile does not mean that the cross-examination can go beyond the scope of direct examination. The rule governing the scope of cross-examination is the same for hostile and non-hostile witnesses. Thus, Answer B is incorrect. Under Rule 611(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting credibility. Thus, A is correct. Although the court has discretion under this rule to permit inquiry into additional matters, the defendant is not \"entitled\" to a wider scope of cross-examination. Thus, C is incorrect. Furthermore, there is no such rule permitting cross-examination of unlimited scope of an agent of a party. The scope of cross-examination for all witnesses is controlled by Rule 611(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Thus, D is incorrect."

After a sidebar conference at which the prosecutor gave the judge a record showing that the defendant's medical school had disciplined her for altering her transcript, the prosecutor proposes to ask the witness on cross-examination: \"Have you ever heard that the defendant falsified her medical school transcript?\" Is the prosecutor's question proper?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. The incident can be offered on cross-examination of the character witness, the proper purpose being to show that the witness's assessment of the defendant's character for honesty is not credible. The intent of the question is to test the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation on the one hand, and the quality of the community on the other. If the witness hasn't heard about the falsification, he might not be very plugged in to the community and so might be a poor reputation witness. On the other hand, if the witness answers \"yes,\" then the jury might infer that the community in which the defendant has a reputation for complete honesty may be setting the honesty bar pretty low. In either case, the alleged falsification is probative impeachment whether or not it occurred. Note that the courts require that the cross-examiner must have a good faith belief that the event actually occurred before inquiring into the act on cross-examination. In this case, that good faith standard is met by the evidence presented at the sidebar conference that the defendant was disciplined in medical school. The question does not call for a statement that would be used for its truth. Therefore, it is not hearsay. Likewise, the alleged incident is not offered to prove income tax fraud. Rather, the intent of the question is to test the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation on the one hand, and the quality of the community on the other. If the witness hasn't heard about the falsification, he might not be very plugged in to the community and so might be a poor reputation witness. On the other hand, if the witness answers \"yes,\" then the jury might infer that the community in which the defendant has a reputation for complete honesty may be setting the honesty bar pretty low. In either case, the alleged falsification is probative impeachment whether or not it occurred. Thus, answers A and B are incorrect. C is incorrect. Federal Rule of Evidence 405 prohibits evidence of specific acts indicative of a person's character when that character evidence is offered to prove that a person acted in accordance with the character trait on the occasion in question at trial. Thus, the prosecutor may not introduce the incident involving the medical school transcript for the inference that, because the defendant acted dishonestly on that occasion, she likely acted dishonestly with regard to her tax return."

Furthermore, the witness's employment by the insurance company is therefore not collateral. Thus, Answer B is incorrect. C is incorrect. The evidence is not admissible for substantive purposes. FRE 411 bars evidence of liability insurance to prove negligence or wrongful conduct. However, the rule contains an exception allowing the use of such evidence to prove bias.

The witness spouse, in this case the defendant's wife, alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely against her husband; she may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying. The choice is hers. A is incorrect because the adverse spousal privilege is the wife's, and the determination of whether to testify or not is her decision to make. The defendant cannot object and force his wife not to testify. B is incorrect because the defendant's wife can testify, if she wishes, that she saw her husband sell heroin. Her testimony about her firsthand knowledge of the sale does not require that the wife disclose any privileged marital communication from her husband. She will testify as to what she saw.

So let's agree that we'll pay your medical bills, and you release us from any claims you might have.\" The plaintiff refused the offer.

Federal Rule of Evidence 408 excludes \"[e]vidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations.\" Here, there was a dispute, and the manager's statement was made in an effort to settle that dispute. Therefore, the entire statement is inadmissible under Rule 408. While normally an admission of fact accompanying an offer to pay medical bills would be admissible, here, the offer to pay medical bills was part of a settlement negotiation, making any accompanying admissions of fact inadmissible. B is incorrect. If not for Federal Rule of Evidence 408, which protects compromise negotiations, the statement about the slippery condition would be admissible even though the manager denied that it was the cause. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A), party admissions are not considered hearsay when offered against the party who made the admission. Therefore, the plaintiff would be allowed to offer the part of the statement that favors the plaintiff's case, while the part that favors the defendant's case would be excluded as hearsay. The latter part would not be admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(A), because it would be offered by the manager who made the statement. C is incorrect. The statement was by an agent about a matter within his authority, but that only means that the statement is not excluded as hearsay. There is another ground for exclusion, so the statement is inadmissible even though it satisfies the hearsay rule. Federal Rule of Evidence 408 excludes evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations. D is incorrect. Federal Rule of Evidence 408 protects not only offers of compromise, but also \"conduct or statements made in the course of compromise negotiations.\" The rationale is to allow the parties and counsel to speak freely during settlement negotiations, without having to worry that their statements will be used against them at trial. Here, there is a dispute, and the manager's statement was made in an attempt to settle that dispute. Therefore, the statement would be excluded under Rule 408."

        "explanation": "D is correct. The testimony is not barred by the hearsay rule or any other rule and is relevant on the issue of whether the wife survived the husband. The dying woman's statement is not being offered for its truth but only to prove that she could speak and therefore was alive. The witness's testimony is based on her perception and memory and thus satisfies Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. A is incorrect. The majority common law rule, which is followed by Rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, adopts the \"bursting bubble\" view under which a presumption disappears when sufficient counterproof is offered about the presumed fact. Here the testimony of the witness, although not conclusive, is sufficient to rebut the presumption that neither spouse survived the other and to support a jury finding that the wife outlived the husband. Therefore, the presumption is no longer controlling, and the witness's testimony is admissible. B is incorrect. The testimony is not \"too speculative.\" A witness need not be absolutely certain of matters about which the witness testifies. Here the testimony is based on the perception and memory of the witness and thus satisfies Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. C is incorrect. The statement by the woman is not hearsay because it is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. It is being offered to prove that the woman was alive at the time she made the statement and hence is relevant on the issue of whether she survived her husband, even if by only a few minutes."

        "question": "A driver sued her insurance company on an accident insurance policy covering personal injuries to the driver. The insurance company defended on the ground that the driver's injuries were intentionally self-inflicted and therefore excluded from the policy's coverage. The driver testified at trial that she had inflicted the injuries, as her negligence had caused the crash in which she was injured, but that she had not done so intentionally. She then called as a witness her treating psychiatrist to give his opinion that the driver had been mentally unbalanced, but not self-destructive, at the time of the crash. Should the court admit the witness's opinion?",

        "explanation": "A is incorrect. The witness is not offering to testify that the driver is telling the truth. (If the witness were to do so, the testimony would be inadmissible, because credibility is a question for the jury to assess.) The witness is offering to testify only to the driver's pertinent mental state, which is permissible in a civil case such as this. B is incorrect. Rule 704(b), which prohibits an expert from testifying that a criminal defendant had or did not have the requisite mental state to commit the crime charged, is applicable to criminal cases only. There is no absolute bar to such testimony in a civil case such as this. C is incorrect. Under Rule 705, an expert may state an opinion without first testifying to the underlying facts or data. D is correct. The witness's opinion helps the jury understand a relevant mental state. The standard for qualification of an expert is not high; a psychiatrist is qualified to testify to a person's mental state."

        "explanation": "C is correct. Photographs are often useful evidence in establishing disputed facts. However, under FRE 403, the judge always has the right to exclude such evidence if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the photograph. In this case, the photograph is admissible. The defendant has denied that the plaintiff's injuries were severe. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to show the severity of his injuries by introducing the photograph. The evidence relates directly to the appropriate amount of damages and is not unfairly prejudicial. Thus, C is correct, and D is incorrect. Answers A and B are incorrect. A showing was made that the original videotape was erased, so it cannot be produced. The photograph offered was made from the videotape. Therefore the photograph is either a duplicate of the original or an original itself if it is found to be a print from a negative. FRE 1001(d) provides that \"[a]n 'original' of a photograph includes the negative or a print from it.\" Under this definition, if the photograph being offered is found to be a print from the negative of the videotape, then it is itself an \"original\" and no showing of unavailability is required."

        "question": "A buyer and seller entered into a valid, enforceable written contract by which the buyer agreed to purchase Blackacre, which was the seller's residence. One of the contract provisions was that after closing, the seller had the right to remain in residence at Blackacre for up to 30 days before delivering possession to the buyer. The closing took place as scheduled. Title passed to the buyer and the seller remained in possession. Within a few days after the closing, the new house next door that was being constructed for the seller was burned to the ground, and at the end of the 30-day period the seller refused to move out of Blackacre; instead, he tendered to the buyer a monthly rental payment in excess of the fair rental value of Blackacre. The buyer rejected the proposal and that day brought an appropriate action to gain immediate possession of Blackacre. The contract was silent as to the consequences of the seller's failure to give up possession within the 30-day period, and the jurisdiction in which Blackacre is located has no statute dealing directly with this situation, although the landlord-tenant law of the jurisdiction requires a landlord to give a tenant 30 days notice before a tenant may be evicted.

A license is a contractual right to use land that is owned by another party. Because it is a contractual right rather than a property right, the owner of the property is free to terminate or revoke that license at any time. While the licensee may have contractual remedies available to her where a wrongful revocation occurs, these do not affect the property rights of the owner. Therefore, answer B represents the buyer's best argument. A is incorrect because the seller was contractually entitled to enter the land.

The banker and a buyer entered into a written agreement under which the buyer agreed to buy Goldacre for $100,000, its fair market value. The agreement contained all the essential terms of a real estate contract to sell and buy, including a date for closing. The required $50,000 down payment was made. The contract provided that in the event of the buyer's breach, the banker could retain the $50,000 deposit as liquidated damages. Before the date set for the closing in the contract, the buyer died. On the day that the administratrix of the buyer's estate was duly qualified, which was after the closing date, the administratrix made demand for return of the $50,000 deposit. The banker responded by stating that she took such demand to be a declaration that the administratrix did not intend to complete the contract and that the banker considered the contract at an end. The banker further asserted that she was entitled to retain, as liquidated damages, the $50,000. The reasonable market value of Goldacre had increased to $110,000 at that time.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. A seller is entitled to keep a buyer's deposit as liquidated damages following the buyer's breach of the contract, as long as that amount appears to be reasonable in light of the seller's anticipated and actual damages. Many courts will uphold the retention of a deposit of 10% of the sale price or less without inquiry to its reasonableness. The facts indicate that the sale price of Goldacre was set at the \"reasonable market value,\" which was $100,000 at the time of contracting and had increased to $110,000 by the time set for closing. Therefore, the banker did not have actual damages, because she can sell it for $10,000 more, and the most the banker can legally retain is $11,000. Thus, she will not be able to enforce a liquidated damages clause in any higher amount. The administratrix has not sought specific performance of the contract, so the only issue being considered by the court is liquidated damages, so answer A is correct. B is incorrect because the doctrine of equitable conversion would keep the contract alive after the buyer's death, and the banker would close with the buyer's estate. D is incorrect because the banker is not seeking to prevent termination of the contract (through specific performance); she is merely seeking damages. C is incorrect because the court will not enforce an agreement that violates the law, even if both parties have assented to it."

        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. Where the government exercises its condemnation powers, the taking will affect not only the owner of the land, but also any tenants who are leasing that land. The extent of the effect on the tenant's rights depends upon whether there was a complete or partial taking. Where there has been a complete taking (meaning the government has taken all of the property that the tenant was leasing), the lease is automatically terminated, and the tenant has no further obligation to make payments. If, however, there was only a partial taking (meaning some but not all of the land being leased was taken), the tenant is still responsible for making payments, but only in an amount proportionate to the land that was not taken. Note that in the case of a partial taking, the tenant will share in the monies paid by the government to the landlord for the taking to the extent of the tenant's rent liability in the portion of land that was taken. In this case, the facts indicate that part but not all of the land the tenant was leasing was taken by the government. Because there was only a partial taking, the tenant's lease is still in effect. A is incorrect because frustration of purpose is irrelevant to the tenant's contractual obligation to pay for the land he is still leasing (whether he chooses to use that land or not). Answers B and C are incorrect because a government's exercise of its constitutional taking powers does not implicate the warranty of quiet enjoyment, nor does it make a tenant liable for the land taken."

This situation can be contrasted with one in which the buyer might have purchased \"subject to the mortgage,\" in which case only the man would be liable for any deficiency. A is incorrect. An assumption of a mortgage makes a buyer primarily liable for any deficiency. Thus, in this case, the buyer is primarily liable. Absent a release by the bank, the man also is liable, although he is only secondarily liable. This situation can be contrasted to one in which the buyer might have purchased \"subject to the mortgage,\" in which case only the man would be liable for any deficiency. B is incorrect. The agreement in the contract to assume the mortgage created the primary liability for the deficiency in the buyer. The buyer did not have to sign the promissory note to become liable. Absent a release by the bank, the man also is liable, although he is only secondarily liable for any deficiency. D is incorrect. A novation occurs when the bank agrees to substitute the personal liability of the buyer for that of the original debtor, who is then released. In that case there would be an assumption with novation. Here there was no agreement by the bank to release the man from liability and to substitute the buyer as being solely liable for the debt.

        "explanation": "A is correct. Fifteen years ago, each of the parties granted a reciprocal right of first refusal (or a preemptive right) to the other. A right of first refusal is a conditional option. It provides that if the owner ever decides to sell the property, the person or entity holding the right of first refusal has the right to purchase the property on specified terms. In this case, the purchase price was to be set by three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers and was thus fair. These rights of first refusal, however, violate the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. The right to purchase is triggered by the decision to sell the land. In this case, that decision might occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the right was granted. Thus, under the common law, the right of first refusal is struck ab initio. The question notes that the common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in this jurisdiction. Thus, there are no applicable statutory reforms to the rule. And because the daughter prevails, there must be no applicable exceptions to the common law rule. B is incorrect. Ten years ago, the grantee had the right to purchase the larger tract of land under the right of first refusal (or a preemptive right) given to the grantee. The grantee chose not to exercise that right. The fact that the grantee chose not to exercise the right of first refusal has no effect on whether the grantor can exercise the reciprocal right of first refusal regarding the grantee's land. In this case, however, the reciprocal rights of first refusal violate the common law Rule Against Perpetuities and would be struck at once, with neither party able to enforce the right. C is incorrect. Fifteen years ago each of the parties granted a reciprocal right of first refusal (or a preemptive right) to the other. A right of first refusal is a conditional option. It provides that if the owner ever decides to sell the property, the one holding the right of first refusal has the right to purchase it. A right of first refusal may have been granted as to only one of the tracts of land. Here, the rights were reciprocal as to two tracts of land. It does not matter that the tracts were not adjacent. The reciprocal rights of first refusal, however, violate the common law Rule Against Perpetuities and would be struck at once, with neither party able to enforce the right. The right of first refusal is triggered by the decision to sell the land. In this case, that decision might occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the right was granted.

Fifteen years ago each of the parties granted a reciprocal right of first refusal (or a preemptive right) to the other. The reciprocal rights of first refusal, however, violate the common law Rule Against Perpetuities and would be struck at once, with neither party able to enforce the right either for money damages or for specific performance. The right of first refusal is triggered by the decision to sell the land. In this case, that decision might occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the right was granted.

        "question": "A landowner held 500 acres in fee simple absolute. In 2010 the owner platted and obtained all required governmental approvals of two subdivisions of 200 acres each. In 2010 and 2011 commercial buildings and parking facilities were constructed on one, Royal Center, in accordance with the plans disclosed by the plat for each subdivision. Royal Center continues to be used for commercial purposes. The plat of the other, Royal Oaks, showed 250 lots, streets, and utility and drainage easements. All of the lots in Royal Oaks were conveyed during 2010 and 2011. The deeds contained provisions, expressly stated to be binding upon the grantee, his heirs and assigns, requiring the lots to be used only for single-family, residential purposes until 2035. The deeds expressly stated that these provisions were enforceable by the owner of any lot in the Royal Oaks subdivision. At all times since 1999, the 200 acres of Royal Center have been zoned for shopping center use, and the 200 acres in Royal Oaks have been zoned for residential use in a classification which permits both single-family and multiple- family use. Assume that the owner now desires to open his remaining 100 acres as a residential subdivision of 125 lots (with appropriate streets, etc.). He has, as an essential element of his scheme, the feature that the restrictions are identical with those he planned for the original Royal Oaks residential subdivision and, further, that lot owners in Royal Oaks should be able to enforce (by lawsuits) restrictions on the lots in the 100 acres. The zoning for the 100 acres is identical with that for the 200 acres of Royal Oaks residential subdivision. Which of the following best states the chance of success for his scheme?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. He can restrict use only to the extent of that imposed by zoning (that is, to residential use by not more than four dwelling units per lot).",
            "optionB": "B. He cannot restrict the 100 acres to residential use because of the conflicting use for retail commercial purposes in the 200 acres comprising the shopping center.",
            "optionC": "C. He cannot impose any enforceable restriction to residential use only.",
            "optionD": "D. Any chance of success depends upon the 100 acres being considered by the courts as part of a common development scheme which also includes the 200 acres of Royal Oaks."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. The restrictions described in the facts constitute equitable servitudes. An equitable servitude in a deed is only enforceable where a party can establish: 1) intent for the restriction to be enforceable by subsequent grantees, 2) that the subsequent grantee had notice of the servitude, and 3) that the restriction touches and concerns the land. In this case, the facts indicate that all three elements can be established. The express language of the deeds indicates that the restriction is intended to bind subsequent grantees. The recording of those deeds would provide later purchasers with record notice of the restriction. And a restriction on what can be built on the land clearly meets the requirement that the restriction touch and concern that land, so an enforceable equitable servitude was created. For an equitable servitude to bind an entire subdivision, however, it must be found in the common building plan for that subdivision. If it is, then anyone who owns a plot of land within the subdivision is bound by the restrictions and may file suit to enforce those restrictions against other owners. In this case, the facts state that a subdivision plan outlining restrictions that would apply to all plats within it was approved by the local government. But that subdivision plan was only for the original 200 acres of Royal Oaks. The only way that owners in the new 100 acre development will be able to bind owners in the original 200 acres, and vice- versa, is if they are all viewed as living in an area developed under a common plan. Therefore, answer D is correct, and the owner will only succeed if he convinces a court that the entire 300 acres is a subdivision developed under a common plan. A is incorrect because zoning is irrelevant to determining whether the restrictions are binding. Answer B is incorrect because there are two separate subdivisions, and the owner is only trying to expand one of them. Answer C is incorrect because there is no explicit limit on the types of restriction a subdivision may impose."

        "question": "A realty company developed a residential development which included single-family dwellings, town houses, and high- rise apartments for a total of 25,000 dwelling units. Included in the deed to each unit was a covenant under which the grantee's \"heirs and assigns\" agreed to purchase electrical power only from a plant the realty company promised to build and maintain within the development. The realty company constructed the plant and necessary power lines. The plant did not supply power outside the development. An appropriate and fair formula was used to determine price. After constructing and selling 12,500 of the units, the realty company sold its interest in the development to an investor company. The investor company operated the power plant and constructed and sold the remaining 12,500 units. Each conveyance from the investor company contained the same covenant relating to electrical power that the realty company had included in the 12,500 conveyances it had made. A woman bought a dwelling unit from a man, who had purchased it from the realty company. Subsequently, the woman, whose lot was along the boundary of the development, ceased buying electrical power from the investor company and began purchasing power from General Power Company, which provided such service in the area surrounding the development. Both General Power and the investor company have governmental authorization to provide electrical services to the area. The investor company instituted an appropriate action against the woman to enjoin her from obtaining electrical power from General Power.

        "correct_answer": "A",

The restriction, however, does not touch and concern the land; it does not serve to make the land more useful or valuable in any way. Therefore, the restriction will not bind the woman, and answer A is correct. B is incorrect because mixing types of residential units does not negate the provisions of a common development scheme. C is incorrect because the attempted restriction does not purport to limit an owner's alienation rights.

Under this written agreement, which was acknowledged and duly recorded, the miner, for a five-year-period, was given the privilege to enter on Stoneacre to remove sand, gravel, and stone in whatever quantities the miner desired. The miner was to make monthly payments to the owner on the basis of the amount of sand, gravel, and stone removed during the previous month. Under the terms of the agreement, the miner's privilege was exclusive against all others except the owner, who reserved the right to use Stoneacre for any purpose whatsoever including the removal of sand, gravel, and stone. One year after the agreement was entered into, the state brought a condemnation action to take Stoneacre for a highway interchange. In the condemnation action, is the miner entitled to compensation?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. The agreement between the owner and miner created a profit a prendre for the miner. A profit gives the holder a right to enter onto another's land for the purpose of removing some sort of natural resource. Rather than a license, a profit is a property right, and is thereby afforded all the usual statutory and constitutional protections associated with such rights. Because the miner has a property right in Stoneacre, a governmental taking will entitle the miner to share in any condemnation award given to the owner. Therefore, answer B is correct.

At a time when Goldacre was in the adverse possession of a stranger, the man's neighbor obtained the oral permission of the man to use as a road or driveway a portion of Goldacre to reach adjoining land, Twin Pines, which the neighbor owned in fee simple. Thereafter, during all times relevant to this problem, the neighbor used this road across Goldacre regularly for ingress and egress between Twin Pines and a public highway. The stranger quit possession of Goldacre before acquiring title by adverse possession. Without any further communication between the man and the neighbor, the neighbor continued to use the road for a total period, from the time he first began to use it, sufficient to acquire an easement by prescription. The man then blocked the road and refused to permit its continued use. The neighbor brought suit to determine his right to continue use of the road. The neighbor should",

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. The neighbor had the man's express permission to use the road, so that use was never adverse. The neighbor incorrectly argues that he has acquired an easement by prescription. To establish an easement by prescription, a party must show: 1) adverse, 2) continuous, 3) visible, and 4) unpermitted use of the area for the length of the statutory time period. Although the neighbor's use was continuous, visible, and lasted for the length of the statutory time period, that use was not adverse or unpermitted. A is incorrect because the use must be adverse to the owner of the property. B is incorrect because the man's original grant of permission was sufficient, and did not need to be renewed because the stranger never acquired title by adverse possession.

        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A is incorrect because it suggests that the girlfriend wins for being first in time. While this answer would be correct in a jurisdiction with a race recording statute, the type of statute was not provided by the question. B is incorrect because it suggests that the buyer wins because he is a bona fide purchaser who paid value and had no notice of the girlfriend's claim. Although this answer would be correct if the jurisdiction is governed by a notice statute, the facts do not provide what statute is in effect. Therefore, answer B may also be eliminated. C is incorrect. This question does involve estoppel by deed, but only as it applies between the grantor and the original grantee (i.e., the son and the girlfriend). The doctrine of estoppel by deed states that if a grantor purports to convey title that he does not actually hold, his subsequent acquisition of title to the property will automatically bring into effect the the prior benefit conveyed to the grantee. In other words, even though the son did not have title at the time of the conveyance to the girlfriend, when he did obtain title, the girlfriend\u2019s title became valid. The grantor then may be estopped by the grantee from denying he conveyed valid title. However, this right is only held by the grantee against the grantor. The grantee has no such right against a subsequent purchaser. Therefore C is incorrect because the subsequent grantee, here the buyer, is not bound by estoppel by deed. The girlfriend may only apply the doctrine against the son, not the buyer. D is correct. Under the doctrine of estoppel, if the grantor transfers his later-acquired title to a subsequent purchaser, it will also be valid title. The issue becomes whether the buyer is a subsequent bona fide purchaser, and what was his burden of searching title. To be a subsequent bona fide purchaser, the buyer must not have had notice, actual or constructive, of the original grantee. If the original grantee properly recorded, the subsequent buyer would have been on notice and therefore cannot be a valid subsequent bona fide purchaser. Thus D is correct because the issue turns on whether the girlfriend\u2019s deed was properly recorded."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. The covenant of warranty is a guarantee by the seller that the title being conveyed is marketable, and that the grantor will defend any valid claims against that title. A breach of the covenant of warranty is established when a third party interferes with possession of the land, not when a third party makes a claim against the grantee. Consequently, the grantor is not required to defend the grantee or his heirs in any action against title; rather, he must only defend against lawful or reasonable claims for title. In this case, the facts do not indicate that any valid claim existed because the teacher prevailed over the adjoining owner in an action to quiet title. Because the landowner conveyed good title, and did not fail to defend against any valid claims that existed at the time of the conveyance, the landowner should prevail, and answer C is correct. B is incorrect because, although the landowner's deed to the teacher did include the covenant of warranty, the teacher would only be entitled to recover if the adjoining owner's claim was successful.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. A deed must be delivered to be valid. Delivery is a question of intent. The words of the landowner included \"This is yours,\" showing the necessary intent to strip himself of dominion and control and to immediately transfer the title. In addition, handing the deed to the friend raises a rebuttable presumption of delivery. Recording the deed is not required to transfer title, and thus the request not to record the document until later is irrelevant so long as delivery was made. A is incorrect. The deed to the friend was valid because it was in the proper form and was delivered to him. Delivery occurred at the time the landowner handed the deed to the friend. At that time the landowner was competent. The friend's subsequent recording of the deed had no effect on the deed's validity. B is incorrect. The deed to the friend was valid because it was in the proper form and was delivered to him.

Under the UCC, a party may perform his duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform the contract. In other words, performance of the contract by the delegatee ordinarily does not require the assent of the other party to the contract. Because Miller is comparable to the flour wholesaler in terms of reputation and experience, the baked goods producer should not have a particular interest in having the flour wholesaler perform the contract. When the flour wholesaler sold its business and assigned its contracts of sale to Miller, the baked goods producer's agreement to the delegation was not necessary. Therefore A is incorrect.

The builder subsequently defaulted on the loan from the bank. The builder has no assets. It will cost the homeowner at least $8,000 to get the garage finished by another builder.

Although the painter-farmer contract is one for personal services (painting), the item to be painted is a standard barn and the work will be done by a painter of comparable experience and reputation. Therefore, the painter's delegation of the duty was not a breach, even if it was done without the consent of the farmer, and if the farmer refuses performance by the contractor, he will be in breach of contract. A and B are thus incorrect. D is incorrect because the mere delegation of a duty, does not create a novation; a novation would require an express agreement by all parties to substitute the contractor for the painter."

        "question": "On March 31, a seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement in which the seller agreed to fabricate and sell to the buyer 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by the buyer. The contract provided that the buyer would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give the seller funds to \"tool up\" for the work; that the seller would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that the buyer would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that the seller would deliver the balance of the brake linings on June 30. On May 10, the seller notified the buyer that it was doubtful whether the seller could perform because of problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however, the seller assured the buyer that the production difficulties had been overcome, and the buyer paid the seller the first 50 percent installment of the purchase price. The seller did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on May 31, or at any time thereafter; and on June 10, the seller notified that it would not perform the contract. Which of the following is NOT a correct statement of the parties' legal status immediately after the seller's notice on June 10?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The buyer has a cause of action for total breach of contract because of the seller's repudiation, but that cause of action will be lost if the seller retracts its repudiation before the buyer changes its position or manifests to the seller that the buyer considers the repudiation final.",
            "optionB": "B. The buyer can bring suit to rescind the contract even if it elects to await the seller's performance for a commercially reasonable time.",
            "optionC": "C. The buyer can await performance by the seller for a commercially reasonable time, but if the buyer awaits performance beyond that period, it cannot recover any resulting damages that it reasonably could have avoided.",
            "optionD": "D. The buyer has a cause of action for breach of contract that it can successfully assert only after it has given the seller a commercially reasonable time to perform."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. Under the UCC, when either party repudiates a contract for the sale of goods with respect to a performance whose loss will substantially affect the value of the contract, the non-repudiating party may await performance for a commercially reasonable time or immediately resort to remedies for breach of contract. The non- repudiating party, however, may not recover damages that he might have mitigated with reasonable effort. The repudiating party is still free to retract its repudiation unless the non-repudiating party has relied on it or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final. The seller's June 10 statement that it would not perform the contract, when read in light of its earlier communications and failure to make a delivery when due, amounts to a repudiation that gives the buyer the right to bring immediate action for breach. Therefore, D is correct choice because the buyer does not need to give the seller a commercially reasonable time to perform. A, B, and C are incorrect as each of the statements are accurate."

        "question": "On July 15, in a writing signed by both parties, a fixture company agreed to deliver to a druggist on August 15 five storage cabinets from inventory for a total price of $5,000 to be paid on delivery. On August 1, the two parties orally agreed to postpone the delivery date to August 20. On August 20, the fixture company tendered the cabinets to the druggist, who refused to accept or pay for them on the ground that they were not tendered on August 15, even though they otherwise met the contract specifications. Assuming that all appropriate defenses are seasonably raised, will the fixture company succeed in an action against the druggist for breach of contract?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Yes, because neither the July 15 agreement nor the August 1 agreement was required to be in writing.",
            "optionB": "B. Yes, because the August 1 agreement operated as a waiver of the August 15 delivery term.",
            "optionC": "C. No, because there was no consideration to support the August 1 agreement.",
            "optionD": "D. No, because the parol evidence rule will prevent proof of the August 1 agreement."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to fulfill a duty. Under the UCC, consideration is not required for a valid waiver. When the fixture company and the druggist agreed to postpone their delivery date under the contract from August 15 to August 20, in effect the druggist waived a non-material term of the agreement and the waiver was enforceable even without consideration. The druggist, therefore, was not justified in refusing to accept or to pay for the cabinets. A is incorrect because the July 15 agreement falls within the UCC Statute of Frauds, which requires a signed writing in order to enforce a contract for the sale of goods of $500 or more. C is incorrect because the waiver did not require consideration to be effective. D is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not apply to promises made after the adoption of a final written contract."

        "question": "A broker needed a certain rare coin to complete a set that he had contracted to assemble and sell to a collector. On February 1, the broker obtained such a coin from a hoarder in exchange for $1,000 and the broker's signed, written promise to re-deliver to the hoarder \"not later than December 31 this year\" a comparable specimen of the same kind of coin without charge to the hoarder. On February 2, the broker consummated sale of the complete set to the collector. On October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid, sustained rise; on October 15 the hoarder wrote the broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment. The broker replied, \"In view of the surprising market, it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks.\" After receiving the broker's message on October 17, the hoarder telephoned the broker, who said, \"I absolutely will not replace your coin until the market drops far below its present level.\" The hoarder then sued the broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by the broker in February. The trial began on December 1. If the broker moves to dismiss the hoarder's complaint, which of the following is the hoarder's best argument in opposing the motion.",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The hoarder's implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in enforcement of the contract required her to mitigate her losses on the rising market by suing promptly, as she did, after becoming reasonably apprehensive of a prospective breach by the broker.",
            "optionB": "B. Although the doctrine of anticipatory breach is not applicable under the prevailing view if, at the time of repudiation, the repudiatee owes the repudiator no remaining duty of performance, the doctrine applies in this case because the hoarder, the repudiatee, remains potentially liable under an implied warranty that the coin advanced to the broker was genuine.",
            "optionC": "C. When either party to a sale-of-goods contract repudiates with respect to a performance not yet due, the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may in good faith resort to any appropriate remedy for breach.",
            "optionD": "D. Anticipatory repudiation, as a deliberate disruption without legal excuse of an ongoing contractual relationship between the parties, may be treated by the repudiatee at her election as a present tort, actionable at once."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. Under the UCC, when either party to a contract for the sale of goods repudiates the contract with respect to a future performance that will substantially affect the value of that performance, the non-repudiating party may resort to any appropriate remedy for breach. A repudiation is an unequivocal statement of inability or unwillingness to perform. The broker's October 17 statement that he \"absolutely will not\" replace the hoarder's coin until the market drops manifests such an intent; therefore the hoarder is entitled to treat his statement as a total breach of contract, even though performance is not due until December 31. A is incorrect because an injured party must act reasonably to mitigate damages only after the other party commits a material breach or repudiates the contract. B is incorrect because, although the common law recognizes an exception where the non-repudiating party owes no remaining duty of performance, the UCC rule (which governs the hoarder- broker contract because it is for the sale of a good) provides for no such exception. D is incorrect because repudiation typically does not entitle the non-repudiating party to bring a tort action."

        "question": "The owner of a fleet of taxis contracted with a dealer in petroleum products for the purchase and sale of the taxi fleet owner's total requirements of gasoline and oil for one year. As part of that agreement, the petroleum dealer also agreed with the taxi fleet owner that for one year the petroleum dealer would place all his advertising with the taxi fleet owner's wife who owned her own small advertising agency. When the wife was informed of the owner-dealer contract, she declined to accept an advertising account from the soap company because she could not handle both the petroleum dealer and the soap company accounts during the same year. During the first month of the contract, the taxi fleet owner purchased substantial amounts of his gasoline from a supplier other than the petroleum dealer, and the petroleum dealer thereupon notified the wife that he would no longer place his advertising with her agency. In an action against the petroleum dealer for breach of contract, the wife probably will",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. succeed, because she is a third-party beneficiary of the owner-dealer contract.",
            "optionB": "B. succeed, because the taxi fleet owner was acting as the wife's agent when he contracted with the petroleum dealer.",
            "optionC": "C. not succeed, because the failure of a constructive condition precedent excused the petroleum dealer's duty to place his advertising with the wife.",
            "optionD": "D. not succeed, because the wife did not provide any consideration to support the petroleum dealer's promise to place his advertising with her."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one performance will take a period of time to complete while the other can be completed in an instant, completion of the longer performance is a condition precedent to the shorter performance. A party's obligation to perform a contractual duty is excused if the other party fails to satisfy a condition precedent. Implicit in a requirements contract for the purchase and sale of a good is the buyer's obligation to purchase all of its requirements for the good exclusively from the seller for the duration of the contract. Because the taxi fleet owner agreed to purchase its total requirements for gasoline and oil from the petroleum dealer for one year, its purchase of substantial amounts of gasoline from a competitor amounted to a material breach, thereby justifying the petroleum dealer's repudiation of its obligation to place advertising with the wife. Choice A is incorrect because even if the wife was an intended beneficiary, the petroleum dealer can raise any defense against her that he can raise against the taxi fleet owner (i.e., that the taxi fleet owner committed a material breach). Choice B is incorrect because the facts show that only the taxi fleet owner was party to the contract with the petroleum dealer; the wife was, if anything, only an incidental beneficiary. Choice D is incorrect because the consideration supporting the petroleum dealer's obligation to the wife was the taxi fleet owner's promise pursuant to the requirements contract."

The contract contained the following provision: \"It is understood and agreed that the purchaser's obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of said apartment house.\" Which of the following statements concerning the order of performances is LEAST accurate?",
        "options": {

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. This question deals with the distinction between conditions precedent, conditions concurrent, and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions that can occur together with both parties bound to perform at the same time. Therefore, each condition acts as a condition precedent to the other. Finally, a condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance when it occurs. Here, the building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser, and at the same time the purchaser must convey the farm to the building owner, or no further duty arises for either party. After the purchaser conveys the farm (but no more than three months after), the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment. Therefore, the building owner's conveyance of the apartment and the purchaser's tender of the farm are concurrent conditions, and in effect each is a condition \"precedent\" to the other. Thus, A, B, and D are all accurate statements. C is the least accurate statement because the purchaser's tendering of good title to the farm does not excuse the building owner's duty to convey good title to the apartment house.

Conditions concurrent are conditions the can occur together with both parties bound to perform at the same time. A condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance when it occurs. Here, the obligation to remove the shed will give rise to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000. Therefore, it functions as a condition precedent to that duty.

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating that the son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate.

Partial payment of an original debt will satisfy as an accord and satisfaction if there is a bona fide dispute about the validity of the claim. Here, the father honestly did not believe that he owed the creditor.

B is incorrect because the creditor's honest belief will not prevent the discharge of the original debt by accord and satisfaction if the creditor accepts the payment without reservation.

In this case, the dispositive issue is whether the parties' oral agreement is enforceable. Under UCC \u00a7 2-201(1), a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is a writing indicating the contract that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the absence of such a writing signed by the jewelry maker renders the parties' oral agreement unenforceable. An exception to the writing requirement arises when a seller delivers goods that are accepted by the buyer, but in this case, the jewelry maker did not accept the gold. B is correct.

All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before May 1. A student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, \"I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer.\" This note was inadvertently placed in a student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. The student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000.

        "explanation": "B is correct. An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter a bargain, which is made in such a way that the offeree is justified in thinking that her assent will conclude a bargain. Advertisements or announcements directed to the public at large typically are construed as invitations to deal and not as offers, in part out of concern that an open- ended offer to the public would expose the offeror to excessive liability. This rationale will not apply, however, if the language in the announcement is qualified with limiting language such as \"first come first served.\" Because the faculty's $500 offer was limited to the winner of the competition, the public posting of the faculty's notice may reasonably be construed to be an offer. A and C are incorrect because, as explained above, an advertisement or announcement may be construed as an offer where the language of the offer is sufficiently definite. D is incorrect because the offer is not merely gratuitous but seeks the return performance of competing in and winning the writing competition."

The retailer immediately telegraphed the manufacturer: \"Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties.\" The retailer, however, did not ship the ties back to the manufacturer. The manufacturer replied by telegram: \"Will deliver proper ties before July 1.\" The retailer received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it. On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No. V34, but the retailer refused to accept them.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. The retailer satisfied its duty to promptly notify the manufacturer that the goods were rejected as nonconforming. B and C are incorrect because pursuant to UCC 2-206, a seller accepts whether it ships conforming or nonconforming goods. If the seller's shipment, however, is accompanied by notice that the goods are nonconforming and are offered as an accommodation, the seller has not accepted but has made a counter offer, which the retailer could have accepted or rejected. The manufacturer's shipment without notice constituted an attempted acceptance and simultaneously a breach of contract. The retailer was entitled to perfect tender of the goods under UCC 2-601 and was free to reject goods that failed \"in any respect to conform to the contract.\" D is incorrect because the retailer did not waive his rights upon rejection and retention of the goods.

In early 2007 the city's City Council adopted this resolution: The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here. The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 \"for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire.\" Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store's president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective's investigation, the store's employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward. In which of the following ways could the city reward offer be effectively accepted?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. The resolution is an offer of a reward made to the general public. A reasonable interpretation of its words and the circumstances surrounding its broadcast on television indicate that it is inviting anyone to provide the information necessary to arrest and convict. Therefore, an acceptance of this offer made by the city would be any information given that would lead to an arrest of the arsonist. A is incorrect because the language of the reward and the nature of a reward indicate that performance is invited and not promissory acceptance. B is incorrect because it is not reasonable to interpret the words of the reward as requiring actual arrest and participation in the prosecution of an individual when the offer of reward receives such widespread broadcast to the general public. D is incorrect because in order for an offer to require a particular mode of acceptance, it must be clearly stated in the offer. If the offer is silent as to mode of acceptance, a test of reasonableness applies. It would not be reasonable to require such an unorthodox and unavailable mode of acceptance. In this case, a reasonable interpretation of the offer is to require performance, not a promissory acceptance."

        "explanation": "B is correct. If the reward were characterized as a government bounty, the detective's knowledge of the reward after obtaining the confession and the earlier attempted revocation would not be determinative. A is incorrect because although the city benefited, the detective had no reasonable expectation of payment from the city due to his lack of knowledge of the offer, the prior revocation, and the fact that his expectation of payment was from the huge store. C is incorrect. The city was free to revoke the offer for any reason so long as the city revoked by means of general notification equal to that given to the offer. D is also incorrect because even if the reward would create a moral obligation, the city made no subsequent promise to pay the detective. If the reward itself comprised the promise upon which a moral obligation might arise, such an obligation would not arise for an individual who remained unaware of the promise."

The general contractor used the wallpaper hanger's $14,000 figure in preparing and submitting her own sealed bid on Doctors' Building. Before the bids were opened, the wallpaper hanger truthfully advised the general contractor that the former's telegraphic sub-bid had been based on a $4,000 computational error and was therefore revoked. Shortly thereafter, the general contractor was awarded the Doctors' Building construction contract and subsequently contracted with another paperhanger for a price of $18,000. The general contractor now sues the wallpaper hanger to recover $4,000. Which of the following, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor's prospect of recovery?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. After the wallpaper hanger's notice of revocation, the general contractor made a reasonable effort to subcontract with another paperhanger at the lowest possible price.",

            "optionD": "D. The general contractor dealt with all of her subcontractors in good faith and without seeking to renegotiate (lower) the prices they had bid."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. Unless the promisor has given an option promise supported by consideration, generally an offer is freely revocable until the time of acceptance. However, an offer may be irrevocable to the extent necessary to avoid injustice if the offeror should reasonably expect the offer to induce substantial reliance on the part of the offeree and where there is reliance in fact. The terms of the wallpaper hanger's offer suggest that the wallpaper hanger expected the general contractor to rely on his bid by utilizing it in calculating the general contractor's overall bid, and the general contractor in fact did rely on his bid. The fact that the general contractor was required to submit a bid bond to guarantee her bid demonstrates the substantial nature of the general contractor's reliance, because it shows the general contractor cannot pass the additional wallpapering cost on to the owner. Therefore this fact, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor's case for recovery. A, C and D are incorrect because, although each of these factors (mitigation of damages, the wallpaper hanger's negligence and the general contractor's good faith) may weigh in the general contractor's favor, the wallpaper hanger revoked her bid prior to the general contractor's acceptance. Therefore the general contractor cannot recover from the wallpaper hanger for breach of contract unless she can demonstrate that the wallpaper hanger's bid was irrevocable on a reliance theory."

        "question": "A developer, needing a water well on one of his projects, met several times about the matter with a well driller. Subsequently, the well driller sent a developer an unsigned typewritten form captioned \"WELL DRILLING PROPOSAL\" and stating various terms the two had discussed but not agreed upon, including a \"proposed price of $5,000.\" The form concluded, \"This proposal will not become a contract until signed by you [the developer] and then returned to and signed by me [the well driller].\" The developer signed the form and returned it to the well driller, who neglected to sign it but promptly began drilling the well at the proposed site on the developer's project. After drilling for two days, the well driller told the developer during one of the developer's daily visits that he would not finish unless the developer would agree to pay twice the price recited in the written proposal. The developer refused, the well driller quit, and the developer hired substitute to drill the well to completion for a price of $7,500. In an action by the developer against the well driller for damages, which of the following is the probable decision?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The developer wins, because his signing of the well driller's form constituted an acceptance of an offer by the well driller.",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. An offer is a manifestation of a willingness to bargain that creates a capacity in the offeree to form a contract by consent. Since the form that the well driller sent to the developer stated that the proposal would not be a contract until signed by both parties, it is not an offer because it does not manifest an intent to conclude a contract upon mere signing by the developer. However, after the developer signed the form, the form became an offer that the well driller could accept either by signing the form or by manifesting assent in some other way (such as by commencing performance). A is incorrect because the developer's signing of the form amounted to an offer and not an acceptance. C is incorrect because the well driller manifested assent by commencing performance. D is incorrect because the offer sought a return promise, which the well driller implicitly made by commencing performance."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of mutual mistake where the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract that has a material effect on the exchange, and where the party seeking rescission is found by the court not to bear the risk of the mistake. If in his first race after the sale, the horse dropped dead of a rare, undiscoverable heart condition, the trainer could make a plausible argument that the contract be rescinded on grounds of mistake. The condition related to a fundamental assumption (the horse's suitability for racing) that destroyed the subject matter of the contract, and since the heart condition was not expected or discoverable, a court might find that the trainer should not bear the risk of the mistake. B and C are incorrect because neither of these factors relate to a fundamental assumption of the contract, since the facts suggest that the horse was purchased as a racehorse and not a breeder. D is incorrect because the risk that the horse might go beserk was one of which the trainer had notice, and was therefore a risk that he should bear."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of supervening impracticability where a party's performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. Such event may include the destruction or deterioration of a specific thing necessary for the performance of a duty or the necessity to comply with a governmental order. Because the breeder undertook to exhibit his world champion animal(and not any other hog), the animal's availability for exhibition is a basic assumption of the contract. The animal's illness, which requires him to be quarantined for a month under state law, renders the breeder's performance impracticable. Therefore the manager should treat both parties' obligations under the contract as discharged. A, B and D are incorrect because the animal's illness provides a basis for excuse of the breeder's obligation. Specifically, as explained above, the breeder is not obligated to provide a substitute hog because the contract only contemplated exhibiting the champion animal."

        "question": "A computer company contracted in writing with a bank to sell and deliver to the bank a mainframe computer using a new type of magnetic memory, then under development but not perfected by the computer company, at a price substantially lower than that of a similar computer using current technology. The contract's delivery term was \"F.O.B. the bank, on or before July 31.\" Assume that the computer company tendered the computer to the bank on August 15, and that the bank rejected it because of delay. If the computer company sues the bank for breach of contract, which of the following facts, if proved, will best support a recovery by the computer company?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The delay did not materially harm the bank.",
            "optionB": "B. The computer company believed, on the assumption that the bank was getting a \"super deal\" for its money, that the bank would not reject because of the late tender of delivery.",
            "optionC": "C. The computer company's delay in tender was caused by a truckers' strike.",
            "optionD": "D. A usage in the relevant trade allows computer sellers a 30-day leeway in a specified time of delivery, unless the usage is expressly negated by the contract."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. Under the UCC, any trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity in a place, vocation, or trade so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it can be introduced to interpret the parties' agreement, so long as the usage can be reasonably construed as being consistent with the express terms of the contract. Indeed, the UCC defines \"agreement\" as including the parties' express terms as well as those that are implied by applicable trade usage. Although the written contract between the computer company and the bank called for delivery \"on or before July 31,\" the trade usage that the computer company seeks to introduce suggests that buyers should allow for up to 30-days' leeway beyond that date. If the contract were construed in light of this usage, then the August 15 delivery would not be a breach of the contract and the bank would be in breach for refusing to take delivery on that date. The fact that buyers and sellers typically negate the usage with express language if the delivery date is to be construed strictly suggests that the trade usage is fairly persuasive evidence of the parties' intent. A is incorrect because even an immaterial delay in delivery would entitle the bank to reject delivery of the computer. B is incorrect because such an inference would not be reasonable if the contract is literally construed as requiring delivery \"on or before July 31.\" C is incorrect because a truckers' strike would not justify excuse on grounds of impracticability, because the facts do not suggest that the availability of ground shipment is a basic assumption on which the contract was made."

        "question": "A buyer purchased a new car from a dealer under a written contract that provided that the price of the car was $20,000 and that the buyer would receive a \"trade-in allowance of $7,000 for the buyer's old car.\" The old car had recently been damaged in an accident. The contract contained a merger clause stating: \"This writing constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and there are no other understandings or agreements not set forth herein.\" When the buyer took possession of the new car, she delivered the old car to the dealer. At that time, the dealer claimed that the trade-in allowance included an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company for damage to the old car. The buyer refused to provide the assignment. The dealer sued the buyer to recover the insurance payment.

            "optionA": "A. No, because the dealer's acceptance of the old car bars any additional claim by the dealer.",

        "explanation": "A is incorrect. A buyer's mere acceptance of goods does not waive its potential claims against a seller. The dispositive issue here is whether the parol evidence rule will allow the proffered evidence. Under that rule, a merger clause does not conclusively determine that an agreement is completely integrated. Moreover, a finding that an agreement is completely integrated does not necessarily bar the admission of extrinsic evidence. Although extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement or contradict the express terms of a completely integrated agreement, such evidence is admissible to explain the terms of an agreement. In this case, evidence of the parties' discussions during their negotiations is admissible to aid in explaining whether they intended \"trade-in allowance\" to include an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company.

The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to prove that the written agreement is to take effect only upon the occurrence of a stated condition (even if the condition is for only one party's benefit). Because the buyer-shareholder agreement will only take effect upon approval by the parent company, extrinsic evidence of this oral understanding is admissible notwithstanding the parol evidence rule. A is incorrect because the condition appears to be an integral part of the contract of sale.

        "question": "On March 2, a landowner and a builder orally agreed that the builder would erect a boathouse on the landowner's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse, across a neighbor's lot, to a lake. The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10,000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel. Assume that the landowner paid the $2,500 on March 15 and that the builder completed the boathouse according to specifications, but that the landowner then refused to pay the second installment and repudiated the contract. Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense. Which of the following is correct?",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, an unequivocal statement of unwillingness or inability to perform a future contractual obligation, if material, may be treated as a total breach of that obligation. Once a repudiation occurs, the non-repudiating party is discharged from any further performance under the contract and may immediately recover damages for total breach. When a contractor is injured due to an owner's total breach of a construction contract, the contractor generally can recover his expected profit on the entire contract along with any labor and material expenses incurred up until the time that he learned of the owner's breach, minus any progress payments made by the owner. Although the landowner repudiated the agreement just after the second $2,500 progress payment became due, the builder would be entitled to obtain as damages not only the progress payment but also his expected profit on the entire contract. Because these damages would exceed $2,500, answers A and C are incorrect. The builder is also entitled to withhold his remaining performance under the contract and will not be considered in breach. Therefore, answer D is incorrect, making B the correct answer."

The gallery then sold the painting to a third party. It informed the collector that it would pick up the painting within a couple of weeks. Two weeks later, before the gallery picked up the painting, the collector sold and delivered the painting to an art admirer for $550,000 cash, after notifying the admirer about the damage.

However, the collector's exercise of ownership by selling the painting, after his rejection, was wrongful against the gallery and constituted conversion.

The collector's exercise of ownership by selling the painting, after his rejection, was wrongful against the gallery and constituted conversion.

        "question": "A tenant rented a commercial building from a landlord, and operated a business in it. The building's large front window was smashed by vandals six months before expiration of the tenant-landlord lease. The tenant, who was obligated thereunder to effect and pay for repairs in such cases, promptly contracted with a window company to replace the window for $2,000, due 30 days after satisfactory completion of work. The landlord was then unaware of the tenant-window company contract. The window company was aware that the building was under lease, but dealt entirely with the tenant. Sixty days after the window company's satisfactory completion of the window replacement, and prior to the expiration of the tenant's lease, the tenant, then insolvent, ceased doing business and vacated the building. In so doing, the tenant forfeited under the lease provisions its right to the return of a $2,000 security deposit with the landlord. The deposit had been required, however, for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the leased property except ordinary wear and tear. The only such damage occurring during the tenant's occupancy was the smashed window. The window company's $2,000 bill for the window replacement is wholly unpaid. Assuming that the window company has no remedy quasi in rem under the relevant state mechanic's lien statute, which of the following would provide the window company's best chance of an effective remedy in personam against the landlord?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. Generally, a party that has made a contract with another cannot later disregard the contract and bring suit in restitution against a third person, even if that third person has received a benefit from the contract. For example, where the window company has conferred a benefit (replaced the glass in the window) pursuant to its contract with the tenant, it normally would not be able to recover in restitution from the landlord. However, sometimes recovery in restitution is possible, especially where the third person (the landlord) has not already paid someone else for the work and the claimant's (the window company's) avenues to bring suit to enforce the contract have been exhausted. These and other factors suggest that restitution against the landlord would be just in this case: the tenant is insolvent, the landlord collected on a $2,000 deposit that the tenant forfeited because of the broken window, and the fact that the lease expressly contemplated the tenant fixing any damage to the property suggests that the landlord would have requested the work if given the opportunity. B is incorrect because the landlord made no promise on which the window company relied. C is incorrect because the landlord had no knowledge of the window company-tenant contract and therefore could not have implicitly promised to do anything. D is incorrect because on these facts, the window company would be, if anything, an incidental beneficiary of the landlord-tenant contract."

UCC \u00a7 2-709 B is incorrect. UCC \u00a7 2-708(1) gives a seller the right to recover the difference between the contract price and the market price of goods when a buyer has wrongfully rejected the goods.

When a party exercises an option, that party in effect accepts the offer and binds himself to the contract. The friend paid the neighbor $10,000 in exchange for the neighbor's promise not to revoke his offer to sell. When the friend exercised the option, he became obligated to purchase Broadacres for $325,000, and his failure to consummate his purchase entitled the neighbor to pursue remedies for breach of contract. Specific performance generally will be awarded for breach of contract where an award of monetary damages would be inadequate or impracticable. Contracts involving the sale of land historically have been regarded as unique, and therefore equitable relief traditionally has been allowed, even where the breaching party is the buyer. Because the obligation that the neighbor seeks to enforce is the friend's obligation to purchase Broadacres (a contract to purchase land), specific performance will be awarded. A is incorrect because the contract involves the sale of land, and therefore the neighbor will be awarded specific performance. C is incorrect because the neighbor not only is entitled to retain the option price, but he is also entitled to a remedy for the friend's breach. D is incorrect because the friend paid the $10,000 in exchange for the option. Even if the friend failed to exercise the option, he cannot seek return of the purchase price once the option has been given to him."

        "question": "A buyer purchased 100 bolts of standard blue wool, No. 1 quality, from a seller. The sales contract provided that the buyer would make payment prior to inspection. The 100 bolts were shipped, and the buyer paid the seller. Upon inspection, however, the buyer discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. The buyer thereupon tendered back the wool to the seller and demanded return of his payment. The seller refused on the ground that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool. What is the buyer's remedy because the wool was nonconforming?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Specific performance",
            "optionB": "B. Damages measured by the difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming goods",
            "optionC": "C. Damages measured by the price paid plus the difference between the contract price and the cost of buying substitute goods",
            "optionD": "D. None, since he waived his remedies by agreeing to pay before inspection"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct because a buyer is entitled to reject nonconforming goods and to obtain damages pursuant to UCC 2-712(2), which is calculated as the difference between the cost of cover for substitute goods and the contract price. A is incorrect because there are no facts to support a conclusion that blue wool No. 1 quality is unique or that there are other proper circumstances pursuant to UCC 2-716(1), such as an inability to cover. B is incorrect. The difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming goods is the appropriate remedy under UCC 2-714 for accepted goods. This would be the remedy if the buyer kept the No. 2 wool; however, the buyer tendered the goods back to the seller. D is also incorrect because payment prior to inspection does not constitute an acceptance or a waiver of any contract remedies under UCC 2-512(2)."

        "question": "On March 1, a computer programming company orally agreed with a department store to write a set of programs for the department store's computer and to coordinate the programs with the department store's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety: The department store will pay the computer programming company $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store's Zenon 747 computer; the computer programming company to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6, the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After the department store denied liability, the parties orally agreed that the department store should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of the department store's computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by the computer programming company and the department store's computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with the department store's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47 percent. They would, however, save the department store $12,000 a year. Further, if the department store would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by the computer programming company, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent, saving the department store another $8,000 a year. The department store's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs. Assume that the computer programming company's delay in completion did not give the department store the right to renounce the contract and that the parties' escrow agreement was enforceable. Is the computer programming company entitled to recover damages for breach of the contract?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Yes, because the computer programming company had substantially performed.",
            "optionB": "B. Yes, because the program would save the department store $12,000 a year.",
            "optionC": "C. No, because shortening the processing time by one-half was an express condition subsequent.",
            "optionD": "D. No, because the department store's computer systems manager did not certify satisfactory completion of the programs."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. For this question, it is assumed that the contract was not renounced because of the time delay and that the escrow agreement was enforceable. The escrow agreement contained the express condition precedent that the work must be completed to the satisfaction of the department store's computer systems manager. Generally, failure to satisfy an express condition discharges performance. However, when the condition is one of personal satisfaction from one of the parties, and the contract involves personal judgment, the party whose satisfaction is required must act honestly and in good faith. Here, the programming company performance was not to the satisfaction of the store's computer systems manager, and the facts state that his refusal to certify satisfactory completion was done in good faith. Therefore, the programming company failed to meet a valid express condition precedent and the department store is excused from paying. Therefore, the programming company is not entitled to recover damages for breach of contract, as the department store did not breach. A is incorrect because substantial performance will not satisfy as contract performance where an express condition precedent has not been met. B is incorrect because the call of the question asks if the computer programming company can recover damages for breach of contract, and there was no breach of contract by the department store. While the computer programming company would be entitled to some compensation, possibly $12,000, in a quasi-contract action under the theory of unjust enrichment, the question is asking about entitlement to damages based on breach of contract, not about restitution where a contract has been held unenforceable. C is incorrect because the condition of shortening the processing time by one-half was waived when the parties made the escrow agreement, and was replaced with the condition that the work be completed to the satisfaction of the department store's computer systems manager."

        "question": "A woman owns an exceptionally seaworthy boat that she charters for sport fishing at a $500 daily rate. The fee includes the use of the boat with the woman as the captain, and one other crew member, as well as fishing tackle and bait. On May 1, a father agreed with the woman that the father would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for himself and his family for $500. The father paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by the woman as liquidated damages in the event the father canceled or failed to appear. At the time of contracting, the woman told the father to be at the dock at 5 a.m. on May 15. The father and his family, however, did not show up on May 15 until noon. In the meantime, the owner of the boat agreed at 10 a.m. to take a second family out fishing for the rest of the day. The second family happened to come by and inquire about the possibility of such an outing. In view of the late hour, the owner of the boat charged the family $400 and stayed out two hours beyond the customary return time. The father's failure to appear until noon was due to the fact that he had been trying to charter another boat across the bay at a lower rate and had gotten lost after he was unsuccessful in getting such a charter. Which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the rights of the parties?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The woman can retain the $200 paid by the father, because it would be difficult for the woman to establish her actual damages and the sum appears to have been a reasonable forecast in light of anticipated loss of profit from the charter.",
            "optionB": "B. The woman is entitled to retain only $50 (10% of the contract price) and must return $150 to the father.",
            "optionC": "C. The woman must return $100 to the father in order to avoid her own unjust enrichment at the father's expense.",
            "optionD": "D. The woman must return $100 to the father, because the liquidated-damage clause under the circumstances would operate as a penalty."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. A party in breach generally is entitled to restitution of any benefit that he has conferred in the way of part performance in excess of the loss resulting from the breach. Where the parties have agreed that the breaching party's performance is to be retained as liquidated damages, the breaching party is not entitled to restitution if the liquidated damages clause is reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual damages resulting from the breach and the difficulty of proving damages. Although the father may argue that the woman was unjustly enriched to the extent that the deposit exceeded her actual loss, the woman should be able to retain the $200 deposit. Damages representing the inconvenience to the woman resulting from the father's failure to appear are difficult to estimate, and $200 was a reasonable estimate of the anticipated opportunity cost to the woman of not taking other potential customers. B is incorrect because the common law rule on liquidated damages does not specify any maximum percentage. C and D are incorrect because the liquidated damages clause may be enforceable even if the amount of damages specified in the clause exceeds the woman's actual loss."

        "question": "On April 1, an owner and a buyer signed a writing in which the owner, in consideration of $100 to be paid to the owner by the buyer, offered the buyer the right to purchase Greenacre for $100,000 within 30 days. The writing further provided, \"This offer will become effective as an option only if and when the $100 consideration is in fact paid.\" On April 20, the owner, having received no payment or other communication from the buyer, sold and conveyed Greenacre to a citizen for $120,000. On April 21, the owner received a letter from the buyer enclosing a cashier's check for $100 payable to the owner and stating, \"I am hereby exercising my option to purchase Greenacre and am prepared to close whenever you're ready.\" Assume that, for whatever reason, the buyer prevails in the suit against the owner. Which of the following is the buyer entitled to recover?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Nominal damages only, because the remedy of specific performance was not available to the buyer.",
            "optionB": "B. The fair market value, if any, of an assignable option to purchase Greenacre for $100,000.",
            "optionC": "C. $20,000, plus the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of Greenacre on the date of the owner's breach exceeded $120,000.",
            "optionD": "D. The amount, if any, by which the fair market value of Greenacre on the date of the owner's breach exceeded $100,000."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is correct. Although breach of a contract for real estate typically would entitle the buyer to specific performance, specific performance is not possible in this case because the property has been sold to the citizen. As a substitute for specific performance, the buyer may recover expectation damages, or damages that are intended to give the injured party the value of the promise. Damages to an injured buyer in a contract for the sale of real estate are usually measured by the difference between the contract price and the market value of the property as of the time that the buyer learned of the breach, plus any incidental or consequential damages. So if the buyer prevails in her suit against the owner, she may recover damages equal to the excess of the market value of Greenacre over the contract price. A is incorrect because the buyer is entitled to recover either specific performance or expectation damages. B is incorrect because the owner's breach ultimately has caused the buyer to lose Greenacre itself and not just an option to purchase Greenacre. C is incorrect because typically expectation damages are not measured by the better of the contract price-resale price differential and the contract price-market value differential (although each of these is a theoretically possible method of measuring expectation damages)."

        "question": "A victim, injured by a driver in an auto accident, employed an attorney to represent him in the matter. The victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim \"to pay from any settlement with the driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's injuries.\" The contract also provided that the attorney's duties were \"non-assignable.\" The attorney immediately filed suit against the driver. The victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at $1,000, from the doctor, but failed to inform the doctor of the attorney's promise. After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1,000, the victim immediately wrote the doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney. The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill, but the attorney requested a release from their employment contract, stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague was willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit. The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him from their contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor. The colleague subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of the victim's claim against the driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other than the doctor. The victim remains insolvent. In an action by the doctor against the attorney upon the attorney's employment contract with the victim, if the attorney attempted to use the victim's release as a defense, the doctor is likely to argue that",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. the release was ineffective, because the doctor had impliedly assented to the victim-attorney contract.",
            "optionB": "B. the release was ineffective, because the victim would thereby be unjustly enriched.",
            "optionC": "C. there was no consideration for the victim's release of the attorney.",
            "optionD": "D. the attorney's contract duties were too personal to be effectively delegated to the colleague."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A is correct. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary until the beneficiary's rights vest. Rights vest when the beneficiary: (1) manifests assent to the promise, (2) sues to enforce the promise, or (3) materially changes position in reliance on the promise. Here, the doctor was an intended beneficiary of the agreement between the victim and the attorney. Although the doctor received notice of the promise before the victim and the attorney executed the release, he never expressly assented to the promise. However, the doctor can argue that by not pursuing the victim and waiting to collect from the attorney, the doctor impliedly assented to the contract and that assent made the release ineffective. B is incorrect because unjust enrichment is not relevant to the question of whether the attorney was released, and would only be relevant in a quasi-contract action against the victim. C is incorrect because the colleague's promise to represent the victim supplied sufficient consideration to support the promise to release the attorney. D is incorrect because the question of whether the attorney's duties may be freely delegated is irrelevant since the victim assented to the delegation."
