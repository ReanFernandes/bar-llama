            "Rule_Application": "The doctrine of transferred intent applies when the defendant mistakenly targets an individual they believe to be the intended victim, transferring the intent to the mistaken target. In this case, the defendant\u2019s intent to kill the neighbor transfers to the man. However, there was no intent to harm the child, only an accident resulting from the defendant\u2019s actions.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "The correct answer is option B, as the defendant intended to kill the man, not the neighbor or the child, and took voluntary actions to carry out the crime, meeting the requirements of attempt to commit murder."

The statute makes it a misdemeanor to \"knowingly fail to file\" such a report. The defendant, who is licensed to sell prescription drugs, sold $63,000 worth of prescription drugs during 2006 but did not file the report. Charged with the misdemeanor, the defendant testifies that he did a very poor job of keeping records and did not realize that his sales of prescription drugs had exceeded $50,000. If the jury believes the defendant, he should be found",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. guilty, because this is a public welfare offense.",

            "Rule_Application": "The statute punishes 'knowingly fail[ing] to file' the report, which implies a mens rea requirement of knowledge or intent. If the defendant was indeed unaware of his sales exceeding the threshold, he did not 'knowingly fail' to file the report, and thus does not meet the mens rea requirement.",

            "Rule_Application": "Involuntary manslaughter is a form of criminal homicide that involves criminal negligence, which is a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in a similar situation. Here, the father's failure to seek medical attention, driven by pride rather than malice, constitutes such negligence.",

            "Rule_Application": "For a murder to be classified as first-degree, it must be committed with premeditation and deliberation. In this case, the defendant's actions demonstrate a clear intent to kill and deliberate planning, as evidenced by the purchase of rat poison and its use to poison the victim.",

            "Rule_Application": "In larceny cases, courts presume that the statute requires an intentional act by the defendant, implying a specific intent crime. This means the defendant must have acted with the intention of taking the property, rather than merely believing it was abandoned.",

Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found",

When the neighbor refused, the husband escalated further by drawing a knife and lunging at him.",
            "Rule_Application": "Self-defense allows an individual to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. In this scenario, the neighbor\u2019s use of a lamp to strike the husband, who was armed with a knife and lunging towards him, would likely be considered a reasonable response under imminent threat.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "Given that the neighbor was defending himself against an unlawful and immediate threat posed by the husband with a deadly weapon, he acted within the bounds of self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict would be not guilty based on self-defense, supporting option B."

Fearing a hold up, the shopkeeper produced a gun from under the counter, pointed it at the man, and yelled, \"Stop!\" The man ran to the door and the toy gun fell from his pocket. The shopkeeper fired. The shot missed the man, but struck and killed a passerby outside the store.

The evidence showed that the bartender worked in a tavern and sold a bottle of beer to a person who was 17 years old and that the bartender did not ask for or see the purchaser's driver's license or any other identification.

In the application, the officer stated under oath that he believed there was cocaine at that location because of information supplied to him on the morning of October 22 by an informant. He described the informant as a cocaine user who had previously supplied accurate information concerning the use of cocaine in the community and summarized what the informant had told him as follows: the previous night, October 21, the informant was in the defendant's house at the particular address. The defendant gave her cocaine. She also saw three cellophane bags containing cocaine in his bedroom. The warrant was issued and a search of the address was conducted on October 22. The search turned up a quantity of marijuana but no cocaine. The defendant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. The defendant moved to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence contending that the informant was not in the particular address on October 21 or at any other time.

A statute in the jurisdiction requires all day-care workers to report to the police cases where there is probable cause to suspect child abuse and provides for immediate removal from the home of any suspected child abuse victims. The employee was not aware of this statute. Nevertheless, he did report the child's condition to his supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day-care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent. About two weeks after the the employee first noticed the child's condition, the child was beaten to death by his father. The employee has been charged with murder in the death of the child. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the child had been the victim of beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that the employee had seen.

        "question": "  A husband and wife took their 12-year-old son to a political rally to hear a controversial United States senator speak. The speaker was late, and the wife stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. While there, she saw a man placing what she believed to be a bomb against a wall at the back of the building. She went back inside and told her husband what she had seen. Without alerting anyone, they took their son and left. Some 20 minutes later, the bomb exploded, killing eight persons and injuring 50. In the jurisdiction, murder in the first degree is defined as an intentional homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation; murder in the second degree is defined as all other murder at common law; and manslaughter is defined as either a homicide in the heat of passion arising from adequate provocation or a homicide caused by gross negligence or reckless indifference to consequence. As to the deaths of the eight persons, what crime, if any, did the wife commit?",

One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the license number of the driver's car. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her and the car, and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat of the car. Later it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding.

        "question": "  A woman who is a computer whiz decided to dedicate herself to exposing persons who traffic in child pornography. She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?",

At his trial, the evidence established the following: A man and his wife were enjoying a drink at a tavern when the defendant entered and stood near the door. The wife whispered to her husband that the defendant was the man who had insulted her on the street the day before. The husband approached the defendant and said, \"Get out of here, or I'll break your nose.\" The defendant said, \"Don't come any closer, or I'll hurt you.\" When the husband raised his fists menacingly, the defendant pulled a can of pepper spray from his pocket, aimed it at the husband's face, and sprayed. The husband fell to the floor, writhing in pain. Should the defendant be convicted?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because he had no obligation to retreat before resorting to nondeadly force.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because there is no obligation to retreat when one is in an occupied structure.",

            "Rule_Application": "In jurisdictions following the retreat doctrine, the duty to retreat only applies when the defender intends to use deadly force. Since the defendant used nondeadly force (pepper spray), there was no obligation to retreat prior to using force in self-defense.",

        "question": "  A defendant was lawfully arrested without a warrant for bank robbery. He was not given Miranda warnings, but was immediately taken to a police station where he and five other men were placed in a lineup to be viewed by the bank teller. Each man was required to say the words spoken by the bank robber: \"Give me all your money. I've got a gun.\" After all the men in the lineup spoke those words, the teller identified the defendant as the robber. The defendant subsequently moved to suppress the testimony of the teller, claiming the lineup violated his privilege against self-incrimination. At a suppression hearing, the teller testified that she had not gotten a good look at the robber's face, because the robber had been wearing a hat pulled down over most of his face, but that she was certain the defendant was the robber because she had recognized his voice at the lineup. Should the defendant's motion be granted?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because being required to speak at the lineup, while compelled, was not testimonial or communicative.",

The woman was charged in federal court with bank robbery. She moved to suppress the diary. Should the court suppress the diary?",

In this case, the neighbor was already dead when the hitman shot him, so the woman cannot be convicted of murder.

        "question": "  The police suspected a woman of growing marijuana in her private residence. Narcotics officers went to her neighborhood in the middle of the night. Nothing unlawful could be seen from the street, so the officers walked into the neighbors' yard and looked through the woman's kitchen window, which had neither drapes nor shades. The officers observed what appeared to be marijuana plants being cultivated under grow lights in the kitchen. Using this information, the officers obtained a search warrant. The execution of that warrant netted numerous marijuana plants. The woman was charged with possession of marijuana. She moved to suppress the marijuana plants recovered when the warrant was executed, claiming that the evidence supporting the warrant was obtained through a search that violated the Fourth Amendment. Should the marijuana plants be suppressed?",
        "options": {

            "Rule_Application": "The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures, and one has a reasonable expectation of privacy in their home and the activities occurring within. However, this expectation is not absolute and can be diminished or lost if one exposes the activities to the public view, such as through an unobstructed window.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "In this scenario, since the woman did not take any measures to conceal the marijuana plants and they were visible through an unobstructed window, she could have no reasonable expectation of privacy concerning these activities. Therefore, the police observation did not violate the Fourth Amendment, and the evidence obtained through the subsequent search warrant should not be suppressed, supporting option B."

The friend agreed but made the woman promise not to hurt anyone during the robbery. The woman then drove to a sporting goods store, where she explained to the store owner that she needed a small firearm for use in a bank robbery. The store owner responded that he would charge extra because the woman was so unwise as to confide her unlawful plans for using the weapon, and he sold her a handgun at four times the regular price. During the robbery, the woman used the gun to threaten a bank teller into handing over the money. The gun discharged by accident and killed a bank customer.

At trial, an expert witness testified for the defense that the defendant, an athlete, was under the influence of a performance-enhancing drug at the time he committed the battery and that he would not have done so had he not been so influenced. The defendant asked for an instruction to the effect that if the jury believed that he was influenced by the drug at the time of the crime and would not have committed it otherwise, it had to acquit him. Which of the following circumstances would most aid the defendant's argument in favor of such an instruction?",

Intending to cause her boss discomfort, the employee secretly dropped into his coffee three over-the-counter laxative pills. The boss drank the coffee containing the pills.

Returning the envelope to its place, the agent located and interviewed the executive, who admitted that he had paid the man $5,000 to settle a gambling debt; the executive also disclosed that the man regularly took illegal bets from the executive and several of his acquaintances. The agent then interviewed the acquaintances, who confirmed what the executive had told him. The agent then arranged to be introduced to the man at a local bar. After a few drinks, the man, unaware of the agent's identity, boasted that he was one of the biggest bookmakers in the state. The agent testified to all of his investigation's discoveries before a grand jury, which returned an indictment against the man for illegal gambling activities, based solely on the agent's testimony.

The jury convicted the defendant and, following a separate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death.

About two weeks after the the employee first noticed the child's condition, the child was beaten to death by his father. The employee has been charged with murder in the death of the child. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the child had been the victim of beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that the employee had seen. The child's mother had been aware of the beatings but had not stopped them because she was herself afraid of the child's father. The employee's best argument that he is NOT guilty of murder is",

One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to the suspect's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to the suspect's house. The police knocked on the suspect's door and called out, \"Police. Open up. We have a search warrant.\" After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found the suspect with a large brown suitcase and put handcuffs on the suspect. A search of his person revealed a switchblade knife and a .45-caliber pistol. The suspect cursed the police and said, \"You never would have caught me with the stuff if it hadn't been for that lousy snitch Harvey!\" The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every room and closet. They found no one else, but one officer found an Uzi automatic weapon in a box on a closet shelf in the suspect's bedroom. In addition to charges relating to the cocaine in the suitcase, the suspect is charged with unlawful possession of weapons.

        "question": "  A woman who is a computer whiz decided to dedicate herself to exposing persons who traffic in child pornography. She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?",

He took his revolver, went to a bar, and drank until he was very intoxicated.

The hallway floor was covered with vinyl tile. The defendants were the owner of the hotel building and the lessee of the restaurant. The evidence showed that the hallway floor had been waxed approximately an hour before the plaintiff slipped on it, and although the wax had dried, there appeared to be excessive dried wax caked on several of the tiles. The hotel owner's defense was that the hallway was a part of the premises leased to the lessee of the restaurant over which he retained no control, and the lessee denied negligence and alleged contributory negligence. If the plaintiff offered to prove that the day after she fell, the hotel owner had the vinyl tile taken up and replaced with a new floor covering, the trial judge should rule the evidence",

The plaintiff sought discovery of any accident report the employee might have made to the defendant, but the defendant responded that no such report existed. Before trial, the defendant moved to preclude the plaintiff from asking the defendant in the presence of the jury whether he destroyed such a report, because the defendant would then invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. Should the court allow the plaintiff to ask the defendant about the destruction of the report?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because a report that was prepared in anticipation of litigation is not subject to discovery.",
            "optionB": "B. No, because no inference may properly be drawn from invocation of a legitimate privilege.",
            "optionC": "C. Yes, because a party in a civil action may not invoke the privilege against self-incrimination.",

The defendant seeks to avoid testifying about the destruction of the report by invoking the privilege against self-incrimination in a civil trial.",
            "Rule_Application": "In civil cases, a party\u2019s assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination can lead to an adverse inference being drawn by the jury. Additionally, the destruction of evidence can also lead to an adverse inference that the destroyed evidence was unfavorable to the party that destroyed it. Here, the defendant\u2019s invocation of the privilege raises suspicions about the existence and destruction of the report.",

However, if the contractor has not substantially performed, the owner is justified in withholding performance.

The landowner told the purchaser to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his decision and then to record the deed. The purchaser visited the development the next day and completely changed his mind selecting Lot 25. He filled in Lot 25 and duly recorded the deed. The price of Lot 25 and its fair market value was $7500. Before the landowner had time to learn of the purchaser's actions the purchaser sold Lot 25 to a neighbor for $6000 by a duly and properly executed delivered and recorded warranty deed. The neighbor knew that the landowner had put a price of $7500 on Lot 25 but he knew no other facts regarding the landowner-purchaser transaction. The neighbor's attorney accurately reported the purchaser's record title to be good marketable and free of encumbrances.

The son having no assets died as a result of his injuries.

On July 5 the computer programming company completed the programs having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by the computer programming company and the department store\u2019s computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs not being perfectly coordinated with the department store\u2019s billing methods cut processing time by only 47 percent. They would however save the department store $12000 a year. Further if the department store would spend $5000 to change its invoice preparation methods as recommended by the computer programming company the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent saving the department store another $8000 a year. The department store\u2019s computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs. Assume that the computer programming company was in breach of contract because of its four-day delay in completion and that an express condition precedent to the department store\u2019s duty to pay the contract price has failed. Can the computer programming company nevertheless recover the reasonable value of its service?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Yes because continued use of the programs by the department store would save at least $12000 a year.",
            "optionB": "B. Yes because the department store was continuing to use programs created by the computer programming company for which as the department store knew the computer programming company expected to be paid.",
            "optionC": "C. No because failure of an express condition precedent excused the department store from any duty to compensate the computer programming company.",
            "optionD": "D. No because such a recovery by the computer programming company would be inconsistent with a claim by the department store against the computer programming company for breach of contract."

The company completed the programs, but the department store refused to pay due to the breach of the four-day delay in completion.",
            "Rule_Application": "Under quasi-contract, a breaching party may recover the reasonable value of the benefit conferred on the non-breaching party as long as there is no seriously wrongful or unconscionable conduct. In this case, the computer programming company conferred a benefit on the department store by creating the programs, had a reasonable expectation of payment, and the department store requested and accepted the benefit.",

Under state law he cannot acquire tenure until after five consecutive annual contracts. In his third year the assistant professor was notified that he was not being rehired for the following year. Applicable state law and college rules did not require either a statement of reasons or a hearing and in fact neither was offered to the assistant professor.

Under proper management the farm was capable of producing an adequate family income but the widower was unable to do farm work or even to provide for his own personal needs. The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower operated the farm and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed. The nephew who lived about fifty miles away where he was operating a small business of his own terminated his business and moved in with the widower. With the assistance of his wife the nephew gave the widower excellent care until the widower died intestate about five years after the date of the contract. In his final years the widower was confined to his bed and required much personal service of an intimate and arduous sort. The widower was survived by his only son who was also the widower's sole heir. The son resided in a distant city and gave his father no attention in his father's final years. The son showed up for the widower's funeral and demanded that the nephew vacate the farm immediately. Upon the nephew's refusal to do so the son brought an appropriate action for possession. The nephew answered by way of a counterclaim to establish the nephew's right to possession and title to the farm. If the court's decision is in favor of the nephew it will be because",

        "question": "  A man saved the life of his friend's wife who thereafter changed her will to leave the man $1000. However upon the wife's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety of the husband. The property had been purchased by the husband from an inheritance. After the wife died the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: \"In consideration of [the man]'s's saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will I hereby promise to pay [the man] $1000.\" Upon the husband's death the man filed a claim for $1000. The husband's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. On which of the following theories would it be most likely that the man could recover?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The husband and the man have made a compromise.",

The wife had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety with the husband, which he had purchased with an inheritance.",
            "Rule_Application": "Forbearance to assert a claim can be valid consideration for a promise, as long as the claimant had a good faith belief in their right to make such a claim. Here, the man's agreement not to pursue claims against the husband's estate based on the wife's will constitutes consideration for the husband's promise to pay $1,000.",

On March 1 the homeowner's property was inundated by flood waters which did not abate until March 15. The homeowner could not get the house in a condition which would permit the carpenter to begin the repairs until March 31. On that date the carpenter notified the homeowner that he would not repair the house. Which one of the following facts if it was the only one true and known to both parties on January 15 would best serve the carpenter as the basis for a defense in an action brought against him by the homeowner for breach of contract?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The carpenter's busy schedule permitted him to work on the homeowner's house only during the month of March.",

        "question": " A woman who is a chemical engineer has no interest in or connection with Chemco. The engineer noticed that Chemco's most recent publicly issued financial statement listed as part of Chemco's assets a large inventory of a certain special chemical compound. This asset was listed at a cost of $100000 but the engineer knew that the ingredients of the compound were in short supply and that the current market value of the inventory was in excess of $1000000. There was no current public quotation of the price of Chemco stock. The book value of Chemco stock according to the statement was $5 a share; its actual value was $30 a share. Knowing these facts the engineer offered to purchase from a stockholder at $6 a share the 1000 shares of Chemco stock owned by the stockholder. The stockholder and the engineer had not previously met. The stockholder sold the stock to the engineer for $6 a share. If the stockholder asserts a claim based on misrepresentation against the engineer will the stockholder prevail?",

Unless there is a misrepresentation or partial disclosure, the party with superior knowledge can take advantage of the situation, as long as they do not make any affirmative misstatements.",

She handed him the passbook and verbally conveyed her intent, with disinterested witnesses present. She later attempted to revoke the gift in writing, but the stepson ignored the revocation and she died shortly after.",
            "Rule_Application": "In property law, a gratuitous assignment or gift is irrevocable once it has been completed, i.e., once the owner has relinquished control and the recipient has accepted. The widow's initial verbal gift was an effective transfer of her rights, making it irrevocable. The later revocation was ineffective, as the widow had already lost control of the account.",

On February 1 the builder notified the landowner that he (the builder) would lose money on the job at that price and would not proceed with the work unless the landowner would agree to increase the price to $90000. The landowner thereupon without notifying the builder agreed in writing with a third-party for the third-party commencing April 1 to build the house for $75000 which was the fair market cost of the work to be done. On April 1 both the builder and the third-party showed up at the building site to begin work the builder telling the landowner that he had decided to \"take the loss\" and would build the house for $60000 as originally agreed. The landowner dismissed the builder and allowed the third-party to begin work on the house. The third-party finished the house on schedule and then showed the landowner that he (the third-party) had spent $85000 on the job.

Before the lease was executed the landowner orally promised to have a five-acre parcel surveyed before the end of the lease term. The farmer took possession of the farm and paid for the rent for five years. During the fifth year having decided that he would exercise the purchase option the farmer planted several fruit trees and built a large grain silo on the property. At the end of the term the farmer tendered the landowner $10000 and demanded a conveyance but the landowner repudiated the option agreement and retook possession of the farm. He had never had the five-acre parcel surveyed.  The landowner is not liable to the farmer for breach of land-sale contract.

The homeowner however told the builder on January 2 before the contract was signed that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1. Because she was overextended on other construction jobs the builder did not complete the house until October 15. The landowner returned on November 1 as planned and occupied the house. Ten days later after making the $40000 final payment to the builder the landowner learned for the first time that the house had not been completed until October 15.

Typed conspicuously across the front of the order form was the following: \"[the wholesaler] reserves the right to cancel this order at any time before September 1.\" The manufacturer's mailed response saying \"We accept your order\" was received by the wholesaler on July 21. The wholesaler did not cancel the order and the manufacturer shipped the shovels to the wholesaler on September 15. When the shovels conforming to the order in all respects arrived on October 10 the wholesaler refused to accept them. Which of the following is an accurate statement as of October 10 after the wholesaler rejected the shovels?",

        "question": "  A developer needing a water well on one of his projects met several times about the matter with a well driller. Subsequently the well driller sent a developer an unsigned typewritten form captioned \"WELL DRILLING PROPOSAL\" and stating various terms the two had discussed but not agreed upon including a \"proposed price of $5000.\" The form concluded \"This proposal will not become a contract until signed by you [the developer] and then returned to and signed by me [the well driller].\" The developer signed the form and returned it to the well driller who neglected to sign it but promptly began drilling the well at the proposed site on the developer's project. After drilling for two days the well driller told the developer during one of the developer's daily visits that he would not finish unless the developer would agree to pay twice the price recited in the written proposal. The developer refused the well driller quit and the developer hired substitute to drill the well to completion for a price of $7500. In an action by the developer against the well driller for damages which of the following is the probable decision?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The developer wins because his signing of the well driller's form constituted an acceptance of an offer by the well driller.",

            "optionC": "C. The well driller wins because he never signed the proposal as required by its terms.",
            "optionD": "D. The well driller wins because his commencement of performance merely prevented the developer from revoking his offer made on a form supplied by the well driller and did not obligate the well driller to complete the well."

The developer signed the form and returned it, but the well driller did not sign it. Nonetheless, the well driller began drilling the well, only to later demand a higher price and quit when refused.",
            "Rule_Application": "Since the form sent by the well driller did not constitute an offer, but rather a proposal, the developer\u2019s signing of the form became an offer that the well driller could accept. By commencing performance, the well driller manifested assent and implicitly agreed to complete the well, creating a contract. The well driller\u2019s subsequent demand for a higher price and quitting the project breached this implied contract.",

Shortly before the agreement was signed the owner and landscape architect orally agreed that the writing would not become binding on either party unless the owner's spouse should approve the landscaping design.

Nevertheless the owner ordered the landscape architect to proceed with the work and the landscape architect reluctantly did so.

        "question": "  A landowner contracted in a signed writing to sell Greenacre a 500-acre tract of farmland to a farmer. The contract provided for exchange of the deed and purchase price of $500000 in cash on January 15. Possession was to be given to the farmer on the same date. On January 15 the landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30 the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. When the landowner tendered the deed and possession on January 30 the farmer refused to accept either and refused to pay the $500000. Throughout the month of January the market value of Greenacre was $510000 and its fair monthly rental value was $5000. Will the landowner probably succeed in an action against the farmer for specific performance?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Yes because the court will excuse the delay in tender on the ground that there was a temporary impossibility caused by the tenant's holding over.",
            "optionB": "B. Yes because time is ordinarily not of the essence in a land-sale contract.",
            "optionC": "C. No because the landowner breached by failing to tender the deed and possession on January 15.",
            "optionD": "D. No because the landowner's remedy at law for monetary relief is adequate."

            "Legal_Concept": "Specific Performance in Land-Sale Contracts, particularly the impact of partial breach and the exception to the general rule that time is of the essence in contractual obligations.",
            "Fact_Analysis": "The landowner breached the contract by failing to tender the deed and possession on January 15, due to the tenant's refusal to vacate the premises. However, the landowner assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on January 30, which he eventually did.",
            "Rule_Application": "In a land-sale contract, time is not typically of the essence, which means a partial breach due to a brief delay does not excuse the other party's performance. The farmer's refusal to accept the deed and pay the purchase price on January 30 constituted a repudiation of the contract, entitling the landowner to specific performance.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "Given the partial breach and the farmer's subsequent repudiation, the landowner will likely succeed in an action for specific performance, supporting option B."

On January 15 landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30 the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. Throughout the month of January the market value of Greenacre was $510000 and its fair monthly rental value was $5000. On January 30 the farmer accepted a conveyance and possession of Greenacre and paid the $500000 purchase price but notified the landowner that he was reserving any rights he might have to damages caused by the landowner's breach. The farmer intended to use the land for raising cattle and had entered into a contract for the purchase of 500 head of cattle to be delivered to Greenacre on January 15. Because he did not have possession of Greenacre on that date he had to rent another pasture at a cost of $2000 to graze the cattle for 15 days. The landowner had no reason to know that the farmer intended to use Greenacre for raising cattle or that he was purchasing cattle to be grazed on Greenacre. In an action by the farmer against the landowner for damages the farmer is entitled to recover",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. nothing because by paying the purchase price on January 30 he waived whatever cause of action he may have had.",

        "question": "  On December 1 a broker contracted with a collector to sell her one of a certain type of rare coin for $12000 delivery and payment to occur on the next March 1. To fulfill that contract and without the collector's knowledge the broker contracted on January 1 to purchase for $10000 a specimen of that type of coin from a hoarder delivery and payment to occur on February 1. The market price of such coins had unexpectedly fallen to $8000 by February 1 when the hoarder tendered the coin and the broker repudiated. On February 25 the market in such coins suddenly reversed and had stabilized at $12000 on March 1. The broker however had failed to obtain a specimen of the coin and repudiated his agreement with the collector when she tendered the $12000 agreed price on March 1. Later that day after learning by chance of the broker's dealing with the collector the hoarder telephoned the collector and said: \"Listen the broker probably owes me at least $2000 in damages for refusing wrongfully to buy my coin for $10000 on February 1 when the market was down to $8000. But I'm in good shape in view of the market's recovery since then and I think you ought to get after the so-and-so.\" If the collector immediately sues the broker for his breach of the broker-hoarder contract which of the following will the court probably decide?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The broker wins because the collector if a beneficiary at all of the broker-hoarder contract was only an incidental beneficiary.",
            "optionB": "B. The broker wins because as of March 1 neither the hoarder nor the collector had sustained any damage from the broker's repudiation of both contracts.",
            "optionC": "C. The collector wins because she was an intended beneficiary of the broker-hoarder contract under which damages for the broker's repudiation became fixed on February 1.",
            "optionD": "D. The collector wins because she took an effective assignment of the hoarder's claim for damages against the broker when the hoarder suggested that the collector \"get after the so-and-so.\""

The hoarder tendered the coin on February 1, but the broker repudiated, and the market price had fallen to $8,000. Later, the market recovered, and the broker breached the contract with the collector",
            "Rule_Application": "To have standing to enforce a promise, a third-party must be an intended beneficiary, meaning recognition of their right to performance is necessary to effectuate the parties' intent. An incidental beneficiary, on the other hand, does not have this right",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "Given the facts, it is unlikely that the hoarder intended to confer a benefit on the collector in the broker-hoarder contract.

        "question": " For an agreed price of $20 million a builder contracted with a property owner to design and build on the property owner's commercial plot a 15-story office building. In excavating for the foundation and underground utilities the builder encountered a massive layer of granite at a depth of 15 feet. By reasonable safety criteria the building's foundation required a minimum excavation of 25 feet. When the contract was made neither the property owner nor the builder was aware of the subsurface granite for the presence of which neither party had hired a qualified expert to test. Claiming accurately that removal of enough granite to permit the construction as planned would cost him an additional $3 million and a probable net loss on the contract of $2 million the builder refused to proceed with the work unless the property owner would promise to pay an additional $2.5 million for the completed building. If the property owner refuses and sues the builder for breach of contract which of the following will the court probably decide?",

            "optionA": "A. The builder is excused under the modern doctrine of supervening impossibility which includes severe impracticability.",
            "optionB": "B. The builder is excused because the contract is voidable on account of the parties' mutual mistake concerning an essential underlying fact.",
            "optionC": "C. The property owner prevails because the builder assumed the risk of encountering subsurface granite that was unknown to the property owner.",

In this case, the builder, as an excavation expert, should have known to investigate the ground conditions and assume the risk of unknown subsurface conditions.",

On May 1 the widow wrote Nirvana a signed letter offering to buy \"one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment for $180000 cash on delivery not later than June 1.\" By coincidence Nirvana wrote the widow a signed letter on May 1 offering to sell her \"one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment for $180000 cash on delivery not later than June 1.\" These letters crossed in the mail and were respectively received and read by the widow and Nirvana on May 2.

        "question": "  A construction company contracted with a warehouse owner to construct for $500000 a warehouse and an access driveway at highway level. Shortly after commencing work on the driveway which required for the specified level some excavation and removal of surface material the construction company unexpectedly encountered a large mass of solid rock. Upon encountering the rock formation the construction company instead of incurring additional costs to remove it built the access driveway over the rock with a steep grade down to the highway. The warehouse owner who was out of town for several days was unaware of this nonconformity until the driveway had been finished. As built it is too steep to be used safely by trucks or cars particularly in the wet or icy weather frequently occurring in the area. It would cost $30000 to tear out and rebuild the driveway at highway level. As built the warehouse including the driveway has a fair market value of $550000. The warehouse owner has paid $470000 to the construction company but refuses to pay more because of the nonconforming driveway which the construction company has refused to tear out and rebuild. If the construction company sues the warehouse owner for monetary relief what is the maximum amount that the construction company is entitled to recover?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. $30000 because the fair market value of the warehouse and driveway \"as is\" exceeds the contract price by $50000 (more than the cost of correcting the driveway).",

The warehouse owner paid $47,000 but refused to pay more due to the nonconforming driveway, which the construction company refused to tear out and rebuild.",
            "Rule_Application": "Under the general damages rule, the owner is entitled to damages equal to the cost to complete the work as promised, which in this case is $30,000 to tear out and rebuild the driveway.

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": {
            "Legal_Concept": "Waiver of condition, which is a type of contractual waiver that occurs when a party entitled to enforce a condition of a contract relinquishes that right, allowing the contract to remain valid despite the non-occurrence of the condition.",
            "Fact_Analysis": "The man and the distributor had an oral agreement that the contract would be effective only if the man notified the distributor in writing by January 2 of a resale agreement. The man failed to provide written notice but verbally informed the distributor on December 16 and the distributor agreed to proceed with delivery without the written notice.",
            "Rule_Application": "When one party waives a condition, they relinquish their right to enforce it, and the contract remains valid. In this scenario, the distributor's verbal agreement on December 16 waived the condition of written notice, making the contract effective despite the non-occurrence of the condition.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "Given that the distributor waived the condition of written notice, the man's claim for breach of contract is supported by the concept of waiver of condition, as stated in option C."

The son sold the colt for $1500 to an experienced racehorse-trainer who knew of the son's ignorance about horses. At the time of the sale the son said to the trainer \"I hate to say it but this horse is bad-tempered and nothing special.\" Assume that soon after the sale the horse won three races and earned $400000 for the trainer. Which of the following additional facts if established by the son would best support his chance of obtaining rescission of the sale to the trainer? ",
        "options": {

            "Fact_Analysis": "The son sold the thoroughbred colt to an experienced trainer for $15,000, unaware of its true potential. The trainer, aware of the son's ignorance, did not disclose the horse's capabilities. Soon after, the horse won three races, earning $400,000 for the trainer.",
            "Rule_Application": "Nondisclosure of a material fact can be tantamount to a misrepresentation of fact, justifying rescission of a contract. This is especially true where one party has a duty to act in good faith and the nondisclosure corrects the other party's mistake about a basic assumption of the contract.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "If the son can establish that the trainer knew the horse's true abilities and failed to disclose them, he may be able to rescind the sale. Therefore, the additional fact that best supports the son's chance of obtaining rescission is the trainer's knowledge of the horse's record-setting time, supporting option B."

The trainer is now seeking to rescind the sale based on the discovery of a rare congenital heart defect that caused the horse's death in its first race.",
            "Rule_Application": "A contract can be rescinded due to mutual mistake if the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption with a material effect on the exchange, and the party seeking rescission does not bear the risk of the mistake.

The fee includes the use of the boat with the woman as the captain and one other crew member as well as fishing tackle and bait. On May 1 a father agreed with the woman that the father would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for himself and his family for $500. The father paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by the woman as liquidated damages in the event the father canceled or failed to appear. At the time of contracting the woman told the father to be at the dock at 5 a.m. on May 15. The father and his family however did not show up on May 15 until noon. In the meantime the owner of the boat agreed at 10 a.m. to take a woman and her family out fishing for the rest of the day. The woman had happened to come by and inquire about the possibility of such an outing. In view of the late hour the owner of the boat charged the woman $400 and stayed out two hours beyond the customary return time. The father's failure to appear until noon was due to the fact that he had been trying to charter another boat across the bay at a lower rate and had gotten lost after he was unsuccessful in getting such a charter. Which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the rights of the parties?",
        "options": {

The original flour wholesaler informed the baked goods producer of this transaction. Assume that the baked goods producer accepted Miller's delivery of the first installment under the flour wholesaler-baked goods producer contract but that the baked goods producer paid the contract price for that installment to the flour wholesaler and refused to pay anything to Miller. In an action by Miller against the baked goods producer for the contractual amount of the first installment which of the following if any will be an effective defense for the baked goods producer? I. The baked goods producer had not expressly agreed to accept Miller as her flour supplier. II. The baked goods producer's payment of the contractual installment to the flour wholesaler discharged her obligation. III. The flour wholesaler remained obligated to the baked goods producer even though the flour wholesaler had assigned the contract to Miller.",

The baked goods producer accepted Miller's delivery of the first installment but paid the contract price to the original flour wholesaler and refused to pay Miller.",
            "Rule_Application": "Under the UCC, a party may perform their duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform. In this case, Miller is comparable to the flour wholesaler, and the baked goods producer should not have a particular interest in having the flour wholesaler perform. Once the assignor receives notice of the assignment, the obligor (baked goods producer) discharges their obligation only by paying the assignee (Miller).",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "None of the defenses are effective. The baked goods producer's payment to the original flour wholesaler did not discharge their obligation, and they should have paid Miller. Therefore, the correct answer is D, neither I nor II nor III."

        "question": "  A client consulted a lawyer about handling the sale of the client's building and asked the lawyer what her legal fee would be. The lawyer replied that her usual charge was $100 per hour and estimated that the legal work on behalf of the client would cost about $5000 at that rate. The client said \"Okay let's proceed with it\" and the lawyer timely and successfully completed the work. Because of unexpected title problems the lawyer reasonably spent 75 hours on the matter and shortly thereafter mailed the client a bill for $7500 with a letter itemizing the work performed and time spent. The client responded by a letter expressing his good-faith belief that the lawyer had agreed to a total fee of no more than $5000. The client enclosed a check in the amount of $5000 payable to the lawyer and conspicuously marked \"Payment in full for legal service in connection with the sale of the client's building.\" Despite reading the \"Payment in full. . .\" language the lawyer without any notation of protest or reservation of rights endorsed and deposited the check to her bank account. The check was duly paid by the client's bank. A few days later the lawyer unsuccessfully demanded payment from the client of the $2500 difference between the amount of her bill and the check and now sues the client for that difference. What if anything can the lawyer recover from the client?",

            "Rule_Application": "Under the accord and satisfaction doctrine, a creditor's acceptance of a lesser payment, marked 'payment in full', without protest, implies acceptance of the offer, discharging the debt. The client's good-faith belief in the validity of their claim provides sufficient consideration to support the modification.",

On February 2 the broker consummated sale of the complete set to the collector.  On October 1 the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid sustained rise; and on October 15 the hoarder wrote the broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment. The broker replied \"In view of the surprising market it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks.\" Having received the broker's message on October 17 the hoarder sued the broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by the broker in February.

On February 1 the broker obtained such a coin from a hoarder in exchange for $1000 and the broker's signed written promise to re-deliver to the hoarder \"not later than December 31 this year\" a comparable specimen of the same kind of coin without charge to the hoarder. On February 2 the broker consummated sale of the complete set to the collector. On October 1 the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid sustained rise; on October 15 the hoarder wrote the broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment. The broker replied \"In view of the surprising market it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks.\" After receiving the broker's message on October 17 the hoarder telephoned the broker who said \"I absolutely will not replace your coin until the market drops far below its present level.\" The hoarder then sued the broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by the broker in February. The trial began on December 1. If the broker moves to dismiss the hoarder's complaint which of the following is the hoarder's best argument in opposing the motion.",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The hoarder's implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in enforcement of the contract required her to mitigate her losses on the rising market by suing promptly as she did after becoming reasonably apprehensive of a prospective breach by the broker.",
            "optionB": "B. Although the doctrine of anticipatory breach is not applicable under the prevailing view if at the time of repudiation the repudiatee owes the repudiator no remaining duty of performance the doctrine applies in this case because the hoarder the repudiatee remains potentially liable under an implied warranty that the coin advanced to the broker was genuine.",
            "optionC": "C. When either party to a sale-of-goods contract repudiates with respect to a performance not yet due the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other the aggrieved party may in good faith resort to any appropriate remedy for breach.",
            "optionD": "D. Anticipatory repudiation as a deliberate disruption without legal excuse of an ongoing contractual relationship between the parties may be treated by the repudiatee at her election as a present tort actionable at once."

            "Rule_Application": "Under the UCC, when either party repudiates a contract with respect to a future performance that will substantially impair the contract's value, the non-repudiating party may resort to any appropriate remedy for breach.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "Given the broker's clear repudiation, the hoarder is entitled to treat it as a total breach of contract and seek remedies. This supports option C as the hoarder's best argument in opposing the motion to dismiss."

On learning of the rejection does the glove manufacturer have a cause of action against the ski-shop operator for breach of contract?",

The collector who had insured the painting for $300000 with an insurance company promised to pay $25000 to a full-time investigator for the insurance company if he effected the return of the painting to her in good condition. By company rules the insurance company permits its investigators to accept and retain rewards from policyholders for the recovery of insured property. The investigator by long and skillful detective work recovered the picture and returned it undamaged to the collector.

On March 2 the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a knitwear company on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the knitwear company order was for a rush job the knitwear company and the textile company included in their contract a liquidated damages clause providing that the textile company would pay $5000 for each day's delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine and as a result the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the knitwear company. The textile company paid $25000 to the knitwear company as liquidated damages and now sues the mechanic for $25000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain little or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair.

A month later the president handed the manager a written signed resolution of the company's Board of Directors stating that when and if the manager should decide to retire at his option the company in recognition of his past service would pay him a $2000-per-month lifetime pension. (The company had no regularized retirement plan for at-will employees.) Shortly thereafter the manager retired and immediately bought a $30000 recreational vehicle for his planned travels. After receiving the promised $2000 monthly pension from the insurance company for six months the manager now unemployable elsewhere received a letter from the insurance company advising him that the pension would cease immediately because of recessionary budget constraints affecting in varying degrees all managerial salaries and retirement pensions. In a suit against the insurance company for breach of contract the manager will probably",

The car dealer then asked the bank whether the bank would accept payments of $1000 per month for 10 months beginning June 1 without interest in payment of the debt. The bank agreed to that arrangement and the car dealer then directed the buyer to make the payments to the bank. When the buyer tendered the first payment to the bank the bank refused the payment asserting that it would accept payment only from the car dealer. On June 2 the bank demanded that the car dealer pay the debt in full immediately. The car dealer refused to pay and the bank sued the car dealer to recover the $10000. In this suit which of the following arguments best supports the bank's claim for immediate payment?",

The same delivery procedure and invoice were used in the present contract as had been used previously. The present contract called for a single delivery of wheat at a price of $300000. The seller delivered the wheat and the buyer then signed the invoice.

In return the client agreed to pay the architect a fee of $10000 to be paid upon the house's completion. After completion the client claimed erroneously but in good faith that the architect's plans were defective. The client orally offered to pay the architect $7500 in full settlement of the claim for the fee. The architect orally accepted that offer despite the fact that the reasonable value of his services was in fact $10000. The client paid the architect $7500 pursuant to their agreement. The architect subsequently sued the client for the remaining $2500. In a preliminary finding the trier of fact found that there were no defects in the architect's plans. Will the architect be likely to prevail in his action against the client for $2500?",

Two weeks later before the gallery picked up the painting the collector sold the painting to an art admirer for $120000 cash after notifying her about the damage. If the collector's sale of the painting was NOT an acceptance of the goods what is the maximum amount that the gallery is entitled to recover from the collector?",

The gallery had already sold the painting to another buyer, and the collector's actions caused the gallery to lose the opportunity to recover the painting.",
            "Rule_Application": "Under UCC, when a buyer rightfully rejects goods, the seller's remedy is to recover the market value of the goods at the time of conversion, not the contract price. In this case, the collector's sale of the painting for $12,000 provides evidence of the painting's fair market value at the time of conversion.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "Given the collector's conversion of the painting, the gallery is entitled to recover $12,000 in damages, which is the fair market value of the painting at the time of conversion, supporting option A."

The clerk confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100000 to fund the annuity but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50000.

On March 2 the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer's order was for a rush job the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause providing that the textile company would pay $5000 for each day's delay in delivery after March 15.  The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine and as a result the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic's best defense to the textile company's action?",

The seller then sent an acknowledgment by fax. The acknowledgment repeated the terms of the buyer's offer and stated that shipment would occur within five days. Among 12 printed terms on the acknowledgment was a statement that any dispute about the cotton's quality would be submitted to arbitration. Neither the buyer nor the seller said anything further about arbitration. The seller shipped the cotton and it was accepted by the buyer. A dispute arose between the buyer and the seller as to the quality of the cotton and the seller asserted that the dispute had to be submitted to arbitration. The buyer instead sued the seller in court. In that suit which of the following arguments best supports the seller's position that the buyer must submit the dispute to arbitration?",

He therefore wrote a letter on July 1 to the subcontractor demanding that the subcontractor provide assurance of its ability to meet the September 1 deadline.

The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15 and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2500 on March 15; $2500 when the boathouse was completed; $5000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel. Assume that the landowner paid the $2500 on March 15 and that the builder completed the boathouse according to specifications but that the landowner then refused to pay the second installment and repudiated the contract. Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense. Which of the following is (are) correct? I.

Pursuant to that promise the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on May 1 2001 and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof: The contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by the father and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders Inc. for a construction price of $18000. The father agreed to make payments of $2000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1 2001 upon monthly presentation of certificate by Builders Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001 when he also began building the house. The father made three $2000 payments for the work done in July August and September 2001 without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October but no work was done from November 1 2001 to the end of February 2002 because of bad weather and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1 2002 the contractor demanded payment of $2000 but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement.

Further under a \"liquidated damages\" clause in the agreement the builder promised to pay the landowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1.

The builder completed the house on October 14 and when the landowner returned on November 1 requested the final payment of $40000 and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. The landowner however refused to pay any part of the final installment after the architect told him that the builder \"did a great job and I find no defects worth mentioning; but the builder's contract price was at least $40000 too high especially in view of the big drop in housing values within the past ten months.

The owner of the manufacturing firm repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that \"the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid,\" and that \"I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live.\" After about fifteen minutes the owner of the milk container manufacturing firm stopped speaking, and the amused crowd dispersed. There are three relevant statutes of the state. The first statute prohibits \"all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m.-8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m.-1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m.-5:15 p.m. on Capitol working days.\" A second state statute punishes \"any person who shall intentionally threaten the life or safety of any public official for any act which he performed as part of his public office.\" A third state statute, enacted in 1880, makes criminal \"the utterance in any public place of any blasphemy or sacrilege.\" Assume that there have been only a few recorded prosecutions under the 1880 statute. The milk container manufacturing firm owner is charged with violating its proscriptions. The charge is based wholly on the speech he delivered on the steps of the State Capitol. Which of the following constitutional defenses to this prosecution under the 1880 statute would be the LEAST likely to succeed?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. This statute is vague and, therefore, violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",
            "optionB": "B. This statute is an establishment of religion and, therefore, violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",
            "optionC": "C. Application of this statute to the owner of the manufacturing firm denies him equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.",
            "optionD": "D. Application of this statute to the owner of the manufacturing firm denies him freedom of speech in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment."

The speech did not cause any disturbance and the crowd dispersed after 15 minutes.",
            "Rule_Application": "The prosecution of the owner under the 1880 statute raises constitutional issues, including the vagueness of the terms 'blasphemy or sacrilege', potential establishment of religion, and limitation of free speech. However, an equal protection defense is unlikely to succeed due to the difficulty in proving selective prosecution.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "The least likely defense to succeed is option C, which argues that the application of the statute denies the owner equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment."

        "question": " A state statute makes fraud for personal financial gain a crime. The defendant was convicted of violating this statute on three separate occasions. Following his most recent conviction, he professed to have undergone a religious conversion and proclaimed himself to be the divine minister of \"St. Rockport,\" an alleged messiah who would shortly be making his appearance on earth. The defendant solicited cash donations from the public to support his efforts to spread the word of St. Rockport and his coming appearance on earth. Following complaints by several contributors who claimed he defrauded them, the defendant was again charged with fraud under this state statute. The charge was that the defendant \"should have known that his representations about St. Rockport were false and, therefore, that he made them solely to collect cash donations for his personal gain.\" A witness for the prosecution in the defendant's trial stated that the defendant had admitted that, at times, he had doubts about the existence of St. Rockport.

Public schools also receive other revenue from private gifts, federal grants, student fees, and local sales taxes. For many years, the state has distributed additional funds, which come from the state treasury, to local school districts in order to equalize the funds available on a per-student basis for each public school district. These additional funds are distributed on the basis of a state statutory formula that considers only the number of students in each public school district and the real estate tax revenue raised by that district. The formula does not consider other revenue received by a school district from different sources. The school boards of two school districts, together with parents and schoolchildren in those districts, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the state from allocating the additional funds from the state treasury to this formula. They allege that the failure of the state, in allocating this additional money, to take into account a school district's sources of revenue other than revenue derived from taxes levied on real estate located there violates the Fourteenth Amendment.

The concessionaire operated his concession stand out of the federally owned facilities in the park. The federal statute authorizing the Interior Department to grant such concession stands provided that the grantees would pay only a nominal rental fee for use of these federal facilities because of the great benefit their concession stands would provide to the people of the United States. The legislature of the state enacted a statute imposing an occupancy tax on the occupants of real estate within that state that is not subject to state real estate taxes. The statute was intended to equalize the state tax burden on such occupants with that of people occupying real estate that is subject to state real estate taxes. Pursuant to that statute, the state Department of Revenue attempted to collect the state occupancy tax from the concessionaire because the federal facilities occupied by the concessionaire were not subject to state real estate taxes.

A state statute requires occupants of residences with basements susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences tested for the presence of radon and to take specified remedial steps if the test indicates the presence of radon above specified levels. The statute also provides that the testing for radon may be done only by testers licensed by a state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards relating to the accuracy of its testing. These standards may easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology required to meet them is 50% more expensive than the technology required to measure radon accumulations in a slightly less accurate manner. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not license radon testers. However, a federal statute authorizes the EPA to advise on the accuracy of various methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably accurate. A recently established state firm uses a testing method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. The firm is also included by the EPA on a list of testers using methods of testing it believes to be reasonably accurate. The firm applies for a state radon testing license, but its application is denied because the firm cannot demonstrate that the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate to meet the rigorous state statutory standards.

Although the rule had not yet been enforced against them, companies that would be adversely affected by the rule filed a petition for review of the rule in a court of appeals, seeking a declaration that the rule was invalid solely because it was beyond the statutory authority of the EPA.

The companies filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court requesting immediate review of this case by the Supreme Court before the court of appeals has actually decided the case.

In an effort to preserve jobs in the state and to protect its domestic corporations against their sudden acquisition by out-of-state purchasers, the state legislature enacts a statute governing acquisitions of shares in all corporations incorporated in the state.

Components for these computers are manufactured elsewhere in the state and in other states, then shipped to this city, where the computers are assembled. An ordinance of the city imposes a special license tax on all of the many companies engaged in the business of assembling computers in that city. The tax payable by each such company is a percentage of the company's gross receipts. The state statute that authorizes municipalities to impose this license tax has a \"State content\" provision. To comply with this provision of state law, the city license tax ordinance provides that the tax paid by any assembler of computers subject to this tax ordinance will be reduced by a percentage equal to the proportion of computer components manufactured in the state. A prominent company assembles computers in the city and sells them from its offices in the city to buyers throughout the United States. All of the components of its computers come from outside the state. Therefore, the company must pay the city license tax in full without receiving any refund. Other city computer assemblers use components manufactured in the state in varying proportions and, therefore, are entitled to partial reductions of their city license tax payments.

        "question": "  The state of Red sent three of its employees to a city located in the state of Blue to consult with a chemical laboratory there about matters of state business. While in the course of their employment, the three employees of Red negligently released into local Blue waterways some of the chemical samples they had received from the laboratory in Blue. Persons in Blue injured by the release of the chemicals sued the three Red state employees and the state of Red in Blue state courts for the damages they suffered. After a trial in which all of the defendants admitted jurisdiction of the Blue state court and fully participated, plaintiffs received a judgment against all of the defendants for $5 million, which became final. Subsequently, plaintiffs sought to enforce their Blue state court judgment by commencing a proper proceeding in an appropriate court of Red. In that enforcement proceeding, the state of Red argued, as it had done unsuccessfully in the earlier action in Blue state court, that its liability is limited by a law of Red to $100,000 in any tort case. Because the three individual employees of Red are able to pay only $50,000 of the judgment, the only way the injured persons can fully satisfy their Blue state court judgment is from the funds of the state of Red. Can the injured persons recover the full balance of their Blue state court judgment from the state of Red in the enforcement proceeding they filed in a court of Red?",

In the midst of the trial, the judge prohibited any further televising of the defendant's trial because he concluded that the presence of television cameras was disruptive. The student brought an action in federal district court against the judge in the defendant's case asking only for an injunction that would require the judge to resume the televising of the defendant's trial. The student alleged that the judge's order to stop the televising of the defendant's trial deprived him of property--his investment in cable television service--without due process of law. Before the student's case came to trial, the defendant's criminal trial concluded in a conviction and sentencing. There do not appear to be any obvious errors in the proceeding that led to the result in the defendant's case.

        "question": "  A toy manufacturer that has its headquarters and sole manufacturing plant in a particular state developed a \"Martian\" toy that simulates the exploration of Mars by a remote-controlled vehicle. It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside the state, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in the state. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in the state. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in the state. The state legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of the state from faulty science and to protect in-state toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in the state of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in the state satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the state law constitutional?",

Students, staff, and faculty convicted by campus tribunals of violating the regulation were made subject to penalties that included fines, suspensions, expulsions, and termination of employment. The regulation was widely unpopular and there was a great deal of public anger directed toward the professors who drafted it. The following year, the state legislature approved a severable provision in the appropriations bill for the university declaring that none of the university's funding could be used to pay the two professors, who were specifically named in the provision.

The National Park Service entered into a contract with an independent antique collector to acquire items owned by residents of the city during the president's lifetime. According to the contract, the collector purchases items and then sells them to the Park Service at a price equal to the collector's cost plus a 10% commission. Purchases by antique collectors are ordinarily subject to the sales tax of the state in which the city is located. The collector files suit in state court to enjoin collection of the tax on these purchases, claiming that the sales tax is unconstitutional as applied to them. Should the state court issue the injunction?",

The statute also provided that public proceedings must precede adoption of the standards, and that once they were adopted, the standards would be subject to judicial review. No standards have yet been adopted. Several officials of the National Bureau of Standards have indicated their personal preference for beer produced by a special brewing process commonly referred to as pasteurization. However, these officials have not indicated whether they intend to include a requirement for pasteurization in the minimum beer quality standards to be adopted by the Bureau. A brewery that produces an unpasteurized beer believes that its brewing process is as safe as pasteurization. The brewery is concerned that, after the appropriate proceedings, the Bureau may adopt quality standards that will prohibit the sale of any unpasteurized beer. As a result, the brewery sued in federal district court to enjoin the Bureau from adopting any standards that would prohibit the sale of unpasteurized beer in this country. How should the district court dispose of the suit?",

The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state.

Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization's request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization's placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator's decision was final.

The investigation revealed that the sun's glare off of these trucks blinded the drivers of other vehicles. The state's legislature then enacted a law prohibiting commercial trucks with polished aluminum trailer exteriors from traveling on the state's highways. Litigation over the state law resulted in a final decision by the United States Supreme Court that the law impermissibly burdened interstate commerce and, therefore, was unconstitutional.

The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community's residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens' group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill.

A state statute requires occupants of residences with basements susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences tested for the presence of radon and to take specified remedial steps if the test indicates the presence of radon above specified levels. The statute also provides that the testing for radon may be done only by testers licensed by a state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards relating to the accuracy of its testing. These standards may easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology required to meet them is 50% more expensive than the technology required to measure radon accumulations in a slightly less accurate manner. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not license radon testers. However, a federal statute authorizes the EPA to advise on the accuracy of various methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably accurate. A recently established state firm uses a testing method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. The firm is also included by the EPA on a list of testers using methods of testing it believes to be reasonably accurate. The firm applies for a state radon testing license, but its application is denied because the firm cannot demonstrate that the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate to meet the rigorous state statutory standards.

The easement permitted the Water District to enter Barrenacres for only the stated purposes. The Water District promptly and properly recorded the deed. In 1961, the Water District installed a water main which crossed Barrenacres within the described strip; the Water District has not since entered Barrenacres. In 1965, the landowner sold Barrenacres to a purchaser, but the deed, which was promptly and properly recorded, failed to refer to the Water District easement. The purchaser built his home on Barrenacres in 1965, and since that time he has planted and maintained, at great expense in money, time, and effort, a formal garden area which covers, among other areas, the surface of the twenty-foot easement strip. In 2006, the Water District proposed to excavate the entire length of its main in order to inspect, repair, and replace the main, to the extent necessary.

It is in an area that for fifteen years has been zoned for small retail businesses, apartment buildings, and one-and two-family residences. The zoning code specifies that \"small retail business\" includes \"businesses where food and drink are dispensed for consumption on the premises.\" The diner was the first drive-in in the town. For seven years, a husband and wife have owned and lived in their single-family residence, which is across the street from the diner. The diner is heavily patronized during the day and night by high school students. The noise and lights of the cars, the lights illuminating the diner's parking lot, and the noise from the loudspeaker of the ordering system prevented the homeowners from sleeping before midnight. Paper cups, napkins, and other items from the drive-in are regularly blown into the homeowners' front yard by the prevailing wind. The traffic to and from the diner is so heavy on the street in front of their house that the homeowners are afraid to allow their small children to play in the front yard. The homeowners have asserted a claim against the diner based on private nuisance. The most likely effect of the fact that the homeowners were in the area before the diner is that it",

He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club; the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate the landowner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold. The landowner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established: I. Aside from the country club and golf course, there will be no land use other than for residential use and occupancy in the 1,500 acres. II. The residents of the subdivision will have unambiguous rights and access to the club and golf course facilities. III. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right to transfer his lot to a purchaser with all original benefits. IV.

        "question": "  Two friends, a man and a woman, owned a large tract of land, Blackacre, in fee simple as joint tenants with right of survivorship. While the woman was on an extended safari in Kenya, the man learned that there were very valuable coal deposits within Blackacre, but he made no attempt to inform the woman. Thereupon, the man conveyed his interest in Blackacre to his wife who immediately reconveyed that interest to the man. The common-law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Shortly thereafter, the man was killed in an automobile accident. His will, which was duly probated, specifically devised his one-half interest in Blackacre to his wife. The woman then returned from Kenya and learned what had happened. The woman brought an appropriate action against the wife, who claimed a one-half interest in Blackacre, seeking a declaratory judgment that she, the woman, was the sole owner of Blackacre. In this action, who should prevail?",

The seller at that time also executed and delivered an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Whiteacre to the buyer. The seller thought she had title to Whiteacre but did not; therefore, no titled passed by virtue of the Whiteacre deed. Whiteacre consisted of three acres of brushland adjoining the west boundary of Blackacre. The buyer has occasionally hunted rabbits on Whiteacre, but less often than annually. No one else came on Whiteacre except occasional rabbit hunters. Twenty years ago, the buyer planted a row of evergreens in the vicinity of the opposite (east) boundary of Blackacre and erected a fence just beyond the evergreens to the east. In fact both the trees and the fence were placed on Greenacre, owned by a neighbor, which bordered the east boundary of Blackacre. The buyer was unsure of the exact boundary, and placed the trees and the fence in order to establish his rights up to the fence. The fence is located ten feet within Greenacre. Now, the buyer has had his property surveyed and the title checked and has learned the facts. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 15 years.

Six years ago, the leasing company leased a one-acre parcel, located in the northeasterly corner of Blackacre, for a term of 30 years, to a restaurant. The restaurant intended to and did construct a fast-food restaurant on the one-acre parcel. The lease provided that: I. The restaurant was to maintain the one-acre parcel and improvements thereon, to maintain full insurance coverage on the one-acre parcel, and to pay all taxes assessed against the one-acre parcel. II. The leasing company was to maintain the access roads and the parking lot areas platted on those portions of Blackacre that adjoined the one-acre parcel and to permit the customers of the restaurant to use them in common with the customers of the other commercial users of the remainder of Blackacre.

About a year later, the businessman borrowed $100,000 from an elderly widow and gave her a mortgage on Blackacre to secure repayment of the loan. The elderly widow did not know about the mortgage held by the woman. The understanding between the businessman and the elderly widow was that the businessman would use the $100,000 to pay off the mortgage held by the man and that the elderly widow would, therefore, have a first mortgage on Blackacre.

The friend paid the landowner $5,000 down in cash and agreed to pay the balance of $45,000 at an agreed closing time and place. Before the closing, the friend inherited another home and asked the landowner to return his $5,000.

The easement was granted to the religious group by deed from a businesswoman, the owner of one of the adjacent residential properties. The religious group built a driveway on the strip, and the easement was used for 20 years without incident or objection. Last year, as permitted by the applicable zoning ordinance, the religious group constructed a 200-bed nursing home and a parking lot on Blackacre, using all of Blackacre that was available for such development. The nursing home was very successful, and on Sundays visitors to the nursing home overflowed the parking facilities on Blackacre and parked all along the driveway from early in the morning through the evening hours. After two Sundays of the resulting congestion and inconvenience, the businesswoman erected a barrier across the driveway on Sundays preventing any use of the driveway by anyone seeking access to Blackacre.

The lease made the farmer responsible for structural repairs to the barn, unless they were made necessary by actions of the neighbor. One year later, the farmer conveyed the barn and its associated land to a buyer \"subject to the lease to [the neighbor].\" The neighbor paid the next month's rent to the buyer. The next day a portion of an exterior wall of the barn collapsed because of rot in the interior structure of the wall. The wall had appeared to be sound, but a competent engineer, on inspection, would have discovered its condition. Neither the buyer nor the neighbor had the barn inspected by an engineer. The neighbor was injured as a result of the collapse of the wall. The farmer had known that the wall was dangerously weakened by rot and needed immediate repairs, but had not told the neighbor or the buyer. There is no applicable statute. The neighbor brought an appropriate action against the farmer to recover damages for the injuries he sustained. The buyer was not a party. Which of the following is the most appropriate comment concerning the outcome of this action?",

The brother pretended that he was the friend, and he signed the friend's name to all the required documents. The woman provided the entire $50,000 consideration for the transaction. The deed was promptly and properly recorded. Unknown to the woman or her brother, the friend had died several months before the closing. The friend's will, which was duly probated, devised \"All my real estate to my nephew\" and the residue of his estate to the woman. The woman and the nephew have been unable to agree as to the status or disposition of Blackacre.

        "question": "  A banker owned a commercial property, Eastgate, consisting of a one-story building rented to various retail stores and a very large parking lot. Two years ago, the banker died and left Eastgate to her nephew for life, with remainder to her godson, his heirs and assigns. The nephew was 30 years old and the godson was 20 years old when the banker died. The devise of Eastgate was made subject to any mortgage on Eastgate in effect at the time of the banker's death. When the banker executed her will, the balance of the mortgage debt on Eastgate was less than $5,000. A year before her death, the banker suffered financial reverses; and in order to meet her debts, she had mortgaged Eastgate to secure a loan of $150,000. The entire principal of the mortgage remained outstanding when she died. As a result, the net annual income from Eastgate was reduced not only by real estate taxes and regular maintenance costs, but also by the substantial mortgage interest payments that were due each month. The nephew was very dissatisfied with the limited benefit that he was receiving from the life estate. When, earlier this year, Acme, Inc., proposed to purchase Eastgate, demolish the building, pay off the mortgage, and construct a 30-story office building, the nephew was willing to accept Acme's offer. However, the godson adamantly refused the offer, even though he, as the remainderman, paid the principal portion of each monthly mortgage amortization payment. The godson was independently wealthy and wanted to convert Eastgate into a public park when he became entitled to possession. When Acme realized that the godson would not change his mind, Acme modified its proposal to a purchase of the life estate of the nephew. Acme was ready to go ahead with its building plans, relying upon a large life insurance policy on the nephew's life to protect it against the economic risk of his death. The nephew's life expectancy was 45 years. When the godson learned that the nephew had agreed to Acme's modified proposal, the godson brought an appropriate action against them to enjoin their carrying it out. There is no applicable statute. The best argument for the godson is that",

            "Rule_Application": "A life tenant has a duty to avoid voluntary and permissive waste. Demolishing the existing building and constructing a new one, thereby changing the basic use of the land, constitutes voluntary waste, even if the land value increases. The life tenant is liable to the remainderman for any waste during their life tenancy.",

After six months of the tenant's occupancy, the landlord suggested to the tenant that she could buy Blackacre for a monthly payment of no more than her rent. The landlord and the tenant orally agreed that the tenant would pay $25,000 in cash, the annual real estate taxes, the annual fire insurance premiums, and the costs of maintaining Blackacre, plus the monthly mortgage payments that the landlord owed on Blackacre. They further orally agreed that within six years the tenant could pay whatever mortgage balances were then due and the landlord would give her a warranty deed to the property. The tenant's average monthly payments did turn out to be the same as her monthly rent. The tenant fully complied with all of the obligations she had undertaken. She made some structural modifications to Blackacre. Blackacre is now worth 50% more than it was when the landlord and the tenant made their oral agreement.

They expressly agreed that the neighbor would not assume and agree to pay the investor's debt to the partner. The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating in pertinent part \" . . . , subject to a mortgage to [the partner],\" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage. The neighbor took possession of the land and made several mortgage payments, which the partner accepted. Now, however, neither the neighbor nor the investor has made the last three mortgage payments.

The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance.

Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office.

The applicable zoning ordinance requires a minimum of two acres and 100 feet of frontage for buildable lots.",
            "Rule_Application": "Partition in kind, or physical division, is generally preferred, but partition by sale is allowed if a fair and equitable physical division is impossible. The zoning ordinance's requirement of 100 feet of frontage makes it impossible to divide the land fairly, as the brother's proposed lot would have only 50 feet of frontage.",

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\" Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor's intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor's proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. No, because the owners of lots in the subdivision own property benefitted by the original residential covenant and have the sole right to enforce it.",

            "optionC": "C. Yes, because the original restrictive covenant violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.",

A doctor wishes to convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office, which is permitted by the zoning ordinance, but objected to by the man who owns the five-acre tract benefitted by the covenant.",
            "Rule_Application": "A restrictive covenant is a promise that runs with the land, binding on all subsequent owners. The covenant's enforcement is tied to the ownership of the benefitted property.

The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000. The buyer knew nothing of the friend's mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot. Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her bank of the mortgage claimed by the investor's friend, the bank loaned her $15,000, and she gave the bank a note for $15,000 due in two years secured by a mortgage on the lot. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. At that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" Both notes are now due and both the investor and the buyer have refused to pay.

Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee's will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract.

One of the contract provisions was that after closing, the seller had the right to remain in residence at Blackacre for up to 30 days before delivering possession to the buyer. The closing took place as scheduled. Title passed to the buyer and the seller remained in possession. Within a few days after the closing, the new house next door that was being constructed for the seller was burned to the ground, and at the end of the 30-day period the seller refused to move out of Blackacre; instead, he tendered to the buyer a monthly rental payment in excess of the fair rental value of Blackacre. The buyer rejected the proposal and that day brought an appropriate action to gain immediate possession of Blackacre. The contract was silent as to the consequences of the seller's failure to give up possession within the 30-day period, and the jurisdiction in which Blackacre is located has no statute dealing directly with this situation, although the landlord-tenant law of the jurisdiction requires a landlord to give a tenant 30 days notice before a tenant may be evicted.

        "question": "  Blackacre is a three-acre tract of land with a small residence. The owner of Blackacre rented it to a tenant at a monthly rental of $200. The tenant and the owner orally agreed that the tenant would purchase Blackacre from the owner for the sum of $24,000, payable at the rate of $200 a month for ten years and also would pay the real estate taxes and the expenses of insuring and maintaining Blackacre. The owner agreed to give the tenant a deed to Blackacre after five years had passed and $12,000 had been paid on account and to accept from the tenant a note secured by a mortgage for the balance. The tenant continued in possession of Blackacre and performed his obligations as orally agreed. The tenant, without consulting the owner, made improvements for which he paid $1,000. When the tenant had paid $12,000, he tendered a proper note and mortgage to the owner and demanded the delivery of the deed as agreed. The owner did not deny the oral agreement but told the tenant that she had changed her mind, and she refused to complete the transaction. The tenant then brought an action for specific performance. The owner pleaded the Statute of Frauds as her defense. If the owner wins, it will be because",

        "question": "  In 1997 a landowner held Blackacre, a tract of land, in fee simple absolute. In that year he executed and delivered to a purchaser a quitclaim deed which purported to release and quitclaim to the purchaser all of the right, title and interest of the owner in Blackacre. The purchaser accepted the quitclaim and placed the deed in his safety deposit box. The owner was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $35,000. In September, 2001, the owner executed and delivered to the creditor a warranty deed, purporting to convey the fee simple to Blackacre, in exchange for a full release of the debt he owed to the creditor. The creditor immediately recorded his deed. In December, 2001, the purchaser caused his quitclaim deed to Blackacre to be recorded and notified the creditor that he (the purchaser) claimed title. Assume that there is no evidence of occupancy of Blackacre and assume, further, that the jurisdiction where Blackacre is situated has a recording statute which required good faith and value as elements of the junior claimant's priority. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the conflicting claims of the purchaser and the creditor?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The purchaser cannot succeed, because the quitclaim through which he claims prevents him from being bona fide (in good faith).",

The landowner then executed a warranty deed to the creditor in 2001, who recorded it immediately. The creditor is unaware of the purchaser's prior deed, while the purchaser has record notice of the creditor's deed",

        "question": "  A landowner held 500 acres in fee simple absolute. In 1990 the owner platted and obtained all required governmental approvals of two subdivisions of 200 acres each. In 1990 and 1991 commercial buildings and parking facilities were constructed on one, Royal Center, in accordance with the plans disclosed by the plat for each subdivision. Royal Center continues to be used for commercial purposes. The plat of the other, Royal Oaks, showed 250 lots, streets, and utility and drainage easements. All of the lots in Royal Oaks were conveyed during 1990 and 1991. The deeds contained provisions, expressly stated to be binding upon the grantee, his heirs and assigns, requiring the lots to be used only for single-family, residential purposes until 2015. The deeds expressly stated that these provisions were enforceable by the owner of any lot in the Royal Oaks subdivision. At all times since 1979, the 200 acres of Royal Center have been zoned for shopping center use, and the 200 acres in Royal Oaks have been zoned for residential use in a classification which permits both single-family and multiple-family use. Assume that the owner now desires to open his remaining 100 acres as a residential subdivision of 125 lots (with appropriate streets, etc.). He has, as an essential element of his scheme, the feature that the restrictions are identical with those he planned for the original Royal Oaks residential subdivision and, further, that lot owners in Royal Oaks should be able to enforce (by lawsuits) restrictions on the lots in the 100 acres. The zoning for the 100 acres is identical with that for the 200 acres of Royal Oaks residential subdivision. Which of the following best states the chance of success for his scheme?",

            "optionA": "A. He can restrict use only to the extent of that imposed by zoning (that is, to residential use by not more than four dwelling units per lot).",
            "optionB": "B. He cannot restrict the 100 acres to residential use because of the conflicting use for retail commercial purposes in the 200 acres comprising the shopping center.",
            "optionC": "C. He cannot impose any enforceable restriction to residential use only.",
            "optionD": "D. Any chance of success depends upon the 100 acres being considered by the courts as part of a common development scheme which also includes the 200 acres of Royal Oaks."

The 100 acres now being developed have the same zoning and restrictions as Royal Oaks.",
            "Rule_Application": "For an equitable servitude to be enforceable, it must be shown that the restriction was intended to bind subsequent grantees, they had notice of the servitude, and it touches and concerns the land. To bind an entire subdivision, the servitude must be part of a common building plan.",

The defendant used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The plaintiff notified the defendant that cracks were developing in the building situated on the plaintiff's lot.

The business woman, her heirs or assigns, as the case may be, shall have ten days from said offer to accept said offer and thereby to exercise said option. Three years after delivery and recording of the deed and payment of the purchase price, the buyer became ill and moved to a climate more compatible with his health.

Further, the conversion was in violation of the building code. The banker and an employee entered into a valid written contract for the purchase and sale of Whiteacre. The contract provided that the banker was to convey to the employee a marketable title. The contract was silent as to zoning. The employee had fully inspected Whiteacre.

The owner later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a private lender, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the owner defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose on the mortgage on the owner's hotel at that time, but instead brought an action, appropriate under the laws of the jurisdiction and authorized by the mortgage loan documents, for the full amount of the defaulted loan.

A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments.

The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller's alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the buyer?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.",
            "optionB": "B. Yes, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a mortgage and the outstanding mortgage impairs the buyer's equity of redemption.",
            "optionC": "C. No, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a security device.",
            "optionD": "D. No, because the time for the seller to deliver marketable title has not arrived."

            "Legal_Concept": "The obligation to convey marketable title in an installment purchase contract, particularly when the seller still has time to clear any defects in title before the closing date.",
            "Fact_Analysis": "The buyer entered into an installment purchase contract and made 10 out of 300 payments, discovering a mortgage on the land that the seller had been paying timely. The land's value was four times the debt owed, and there was no evidence of the seller's insolvency.",
            "Rule_Application": "An installment purchase contract implies an obligation to convey marketable title upon completion of all payments. However, until the closing date, the seller is not required to provide marketable title. As the seller has made timely payments on the mortgage, it is likely that the debt will be cleared by the time the warranty deed is due.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "Given that the seller still has 290 payments to receive before being obligated to provide marketable title, and considering the timely payments on the mortgage, the buyer is not entitled to damages at this time. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."

        "question": " A man contacted his lawyer regarding his right to use a path that was on his neighbor's vacant land. Fifteen years ago, after a part of the path located on his land and connecting his cabin to the public highway washed out, the man cleared a small part of his neighbor's land and rerouted a section of the path through the neighbor's land. Twelve years ago, the neighbor leased her land to some hunters. For the next 12 years, the hunters and the man who had rerouted the path used the path for access to the highway. A month ago, the neighbor discovered that part of the path was on her land. The neighbor told the man that she had not given him permission to cross her land and that she would be closing the rerouted path after 90 days. The man's land and the neighbor's land have never been in common ownership. The period of time necessary to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The period of time necessary to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. What should the lawyer tell the man concerning his right to use the rerouted path on the neighbor's land?",

The sister and the cousin are longtime residents of another state. One year ago, the man moved to an apartment and rented the house to a tenant for three years under a lease that the man and the tenant both signed. The tenant has since paid the rent each month to the man. Recently, the sister and the cousin learned about the rental. They brought an appropriate action against the tenant to have the lease declared void and to have the tenant evicted. The tenant raised all available defenses. What will the court likely decide?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The lease is void, and the tenant is evicted.",

The sister and the cousin, also tenants in common, were not aware of the lease until recently and are now seeking to have it declared void and to evict the tenant.",
            "Rule_Application": "A tenant in common may transfer their interest in the property by lease, but this does not extinguish the rights of the other cotenants. The tenant obtains only the transferor's concurrent right of possession with the other tenants in common, and the cotenants must share the right of possession for the term of the lease.",

        "question": "  A woman died, devising land that she owned in another state to her daughter, who was then 17 years old. A neighbor who owned the property immediately adjacent to the land wrongfully began to possess the land at that time. For 24 of the next 25 years, the neighbor planted and harvested crops on the land, hunted on it, and parked cars on it. However, in the sixth year after he first took possession of the land, the neighbor neither planted crops nor hunted nor parked cars on the land because he spent that entire year living in Europe. The neighbor built a small gardening shed on the land, but he never built a residence on it. When the daughter was 28, she was declared mentally incompetent and had a conservator appointed to oversee her affairs. Since then, she has continuously resided in a care facility. The applicable statute of limitations provides as follows: \"An ejectment action shall be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues, but if the person entitled to bring the cause of action is under age 18 or mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues, it may be brought by such person within 10 years after attaining age 18 or after the person becomes competent.\" If the daughter's conservator wins an ejectment action against the neighbor, what will be the most likely explanation?",

The daughter became mentally incompetent at the age of 28 and has had a conservator appointed since then.",
            "Rule_Application": "Adverse possession requires continuous and hostile possession of the land for the statutory period. In this case, the neighbor's absence for one year breaks the continuity of possession, making it less than the 21-year requirement. The tolling statute for minors would not assist the daughter in this case, as her minority ended when she turned 18 and the extension period would not be sufficient to meet the 21-year requirement.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "The correct explanation for the conservator winning the ejectment action is that the neighbor did not have continuous possession of the land for the entire 21-year period, supporting option D."

College Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent one-acre parcel owned by a woman. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. The woman sold Whiteacre to a friend.

        "question": "  A landowner died, validly devising his land to his wife \"for life or until remarriage, then to\" their daughter. Shortly after the landowner's death, his daughter executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey the land to her friend. A year later, the daughter died intestate, with her mother, the original landowner's wife, as her sole heir. The following month, the wife re-married. She then executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey the land to her new husband as a wedding gift. Who now owns what interest in the land?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The daughter's friend owns the fee simple.",
            "optionB": "B. The wife owns the fee simple.",

The daughter then executed a deed conveying the land to her friend, and later died intestate. The wife remarried, and attempted to convey the land to her new husband as a wedding gift.",
            "Rule_Application": "A determinable life estate ends automatically upon the occurrence of the stated condition, in this case the remarriage of the wife. The vested remainder and executory interests can be assigned to another party, as the daughter did with her friend. The wife's attempt to convey the land to her new husband was invalid, as she had no remaining interest in the land.",

The landowner handed the instrument to the friend, saying, \"This is yours, but please do not record it until after I am dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives.\" Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed. The friend said that he would destroy the deed and a day or so later falsely told the landowner that the deed had been destroyed. Six months later, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestate, survived by a daughter as his sole heir at law. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him.

The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller's home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner's insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance.

A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her.

The easement permitted the Water District to enter Barrenacres for only the stated purposes. The Water District promptly and properly recorded the deed. In 1961, the Water District installed a water main which crossed Barrenacres within the described strip; the Water District has not since entered Barrenacres. In 1965, the landowner sold Barrenacres to a purchaser, but the deed, which was promptly and properly recorded, failed to refer to the Water District easement. The purchaser built his home on Barrenacres in 1965, and since that time he has planted and maintained, at great expense in money, time, and effort, a formal garden area which covers, among other areas, the surface of the twenty-foot easement strip. In 2006, the Water District proposed to excavate the entire length of its main in order to inspect, repair, and replace the main, to the extent necessary. At a public meeting, at which the purchaser was present, the Water District announced its plans and declared its intent to do as little damage as possible to any property involved. The purchaser objected to the Water District plans. The purchaser asked his attorney to secure an injunction against the Water District and its proposed entry upon his property.

The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. The owner conveyed Lot 1 to a man and Lot 2 to a woman. The owner retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. The woman, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on her lot. The woman's house included a large window on the side facing Lot 3. The window provided a beautiful view from her living room, thereby adding value to the woman's house. The man erected a house on his lot. The owner made no complaint to either the man or woman concerning the houses they built. After both the man and woman had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that one-half of the way was located on each lot. The man and woman exchanged right-of-way deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded. After the man and woman had lived in their respective houses for thirty years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3. The man informed the woman that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected the woman to do the same.

At the same time, the farmer also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to his son by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property. One year later, the son entered into a lease with the businessman to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, the son remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre. At that time the businessman conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to a friend. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years.

The defendant used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The plaintiff notified the defendant that cracks were developing in the building situated on the plaintiff's lot. The defendant took the view that any subsidence suffered by the plaintiff was due to the weight of the plaintiff's building, and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the plaintiff's soil been in its natural state. The defendant continued to excavate. The building on the plaintiff's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the plaintiff's action to recover damages from the defendant?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The defendant is liable, because she removed necessary support for the plaintiff's lot.",
            "optionB": "B. The defendant cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.",
            "optionC": "C. Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the common-law right of lateral support.",
            "optionD": "D. The defendant's only obligation was to satisfy all local, state, and federal safety regulations."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": {
            "Legal_Concept": "The concept of lateral support in property law, which concerns the right of a landowner to have the neighboring lands provide support to their land, especially in excavations.",
            "Fact_Analysis": "The defendant excavated deeper on their lot, which caused cracks in the plaintiff's office building. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff's building weight caused the subsidence, and the plaintiff sought damages.",
            "Rule_Application": "Under the common law of lateral support, a landowner has a duty to provide lateral support to neighboring lands, unless the neighboring land would have collapsed even without the weight of any structures. The defendant's compliance with safety regulations is not enough to exempt them from liability.",

The small house on Greenacre was occupied, with the farmer's oral permission, rent-free, by the farmer's son, and the college classmate of the farmer's son. The farmer's son was then 21 years old. The farmer, by properly executed instrument, conveyed Greenacre to \"my beloved son, his heirs and assigns, upon the condition precedent that he earn a college degree by the time he reaches the age of 30. If, for any reason, he does not meet this condition, then Greenacre shall become the sole property of my beloved daughter, her heirs and assigns.\" At the time of conveyance, the farmer's son and the college classmate attended a college located several blocks from Greenacre. Neither had earned a college degree. One week after the delivery of the deed to the farmer's son, the farmer's son recorded the deed and immediately told the college classmate that he was going to begin charging the college classmate rent since \"I am now your landlord.\" There is no applicable statute. The farmer's son and the college classmate did not reach an agreement, and the farmer's son served the appropriate notice to terminate whatever tenancy the college classmate had. The farmer's son then sought, in an appropriate action, to oust the college classmate. Who should prevail?",

        "question": "  A little more than five years ago, a businessman completed construction of a single-family home located on Homeacre, a lot that the businessman owned. Five years ago, the businessman and a scientist entered into a valid five-year written lease of Homeacre that included the following language: \"This house is rented as is, without certain necessary or useful items. The parties agree that the scientist may acquire and install such items as she wishes at her expense, and that she may remove them if she wishes at the termination of this lease.\" The scientist decided that the house needed, and she paid cash to have installed, standard-sized combination screen/storm windows, a freestanding refrigerator to fit a kitchen alcove built for that purpose, a built-in electric stove and oven to fit a kitchen counter opening left for that purpose, and carpeting to cover the plywood living room floor. Last month, by legal description of the land, the businessman conveyed Homeacre to a new owner for $100,000. The new owner knew of the scientist's soon-expiring tenancy, but did not examine the written lease. As the lease expiration date approached, the new owner learned that the scientist planned to vacate on schedule, and learned for the first time that she claimed and planned to remove all of the above-listed items that she had installed. The new owner promptly brought an appropriate action to enjoin the scientist from removing those items. The court should decide that the scientist may remove",

            "Fact_Analysis": "The scientist installed various items in the rented home, including windows, a refrigerator, stove, oven, and carpeting. The lease agreement permitted her to install and remove these items at her expense. The new owner of the property is attempting to enjoin the scientist from removing these items.",
            "Rule_Application": "Generally, fixtures are improvements that become part of the property and may not be removed, while chattels are personal property that remain with the owner. However, contractual agreements can supersede these general rules. In this case, the lease agreement explicitly allows the scientist to remove the installed items, indicating that they should be treated as chattels rather than fixtures.",

The owner told her nephew, who was then 19, about the deed and said that she would give it to him when he reached 21 and had received his undergraduate college degree. Shortly afterward the nephew searched the owner's desk, found and removed the deed, and recorded it. A month later, the nephew executed an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey Richacre to his fiancee. He delivered the deed reciting that it was given in exchange for \"$1 and other good and valuable consideration,\" and explained that to make it valid the fiancee must pay him $1. The fiancee, impressed and grateful, did so. Together, they went to the recording office and recorded the deed. The fiancee assumed the nephew had owned Richacre, and knew nothing about the nephew's dealing with the owner. Neither the owner's deed to the nephew nor the nephew's deed to his fiancee mentioned anything about any conditions. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" Two years passed. The nephew turned 21, then graduated from college.

For five years the farmer occupied Greenacre and conducted farming operations. The farmer never accounted to the rancher for any income, but the farmer did pay all real estate taxes when the taxes were due and kept the buildings located on Greenacre insured against loss from fire, storm, and flood. The rancher lived in a distant city and was interested only in realizing a profit from the sale of the land when market conditions produced the price the rancher wanted. The farmer died intestate, survived only by the farmer's sole heir. Thereafter, the sole heir occupied Greenacre but was inexperienced in farming operations. The result was a financial disaster. The sole heir failed to pay real estate taxes for two years. The appropriate governmental authority held a tax sale to recover the taxes due. At such sale the rancher was the only bidder and obtained a conveyance from the appropriate governmental authority upon payment of an amount sufficient to discharge the amounts due for taxes, plus interest and penalties, and the costs of holding the tax sale. The amount paid was one-third of the reasonable market value of Greenacre. Thereafter, the rancher instituted an appropriate action against the sole heir to quiet title in and to recover possession of Greenacre. The sole heir asserted all defenses available to her.

As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land. For whom should the court hold?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The daughter, because the death of the landowner deprived the subsequent recordation of any effect.",

            "Rule_Application": "A deed is considered delivered when the grantor intends to transfer title and relinquish control over the deed. In this case, the landowner's words and actions demonstrate the necessary intent to deliver the deed to the friend. The friend's later recording of the deed is not a requirement for delivery, but rather a separate act that perfects the transfer.",

The aunt failed to make a title search before making the loan. The debtor made no payment to the creditor and defaulted on the mortgage loan from his aunt. A valid judicial foreclosure proceeding was held, in which the creditor, the aunt, and the debtor were named parties. A dispute arose as to which lien has priority. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" A second statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" Who has the prior lien?",

The price was paid, the warranty deed was delivered, and the deed was promptly and properly recorded. Neither the niece nor the colleague had, at that point, ever seen the land. After recording the deed, the colleague visited the land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to any public right-of-way and that none of the surrounding lands had ever been held in common ownership with any previous owner of the tract of land. The colleague sued the niece for damages. For whom will the court find?",
        "options": {
            "optionA": "A. The colleague, because lack of access makes title unmarketable.",
            "optionB": "B. The colleague, because the covenants of warranty and quiet enjoyment in the deed were breached.",

            "Rule_Application": "The covenants of warranty and quiet enjoyment in a deed imply that the seller guarantees the buyer's peaceful and uninterrupted possession of the land. However, they do not guarantee the land's usability or marketability. The lack of access to a public right-of-way is a latent defect that does not breach these covenants.",
            "Legal_Conclusion": "As the colleague accepted the deed, the contract of sale was completed, and the lack of access did not breach any covenants. Therefore, the court will find for the niece, supporting option C."

The mortgage provided that the bank could, at its option, declare the entire loan due and payable if all or any part of the land, or an interest therein, was sold or transferred without the bank's prior written consent. Subsequently, the landowner wanted to sell the land to a neighbor by an installment land contract, but the bank refused to consent. The neighbor's credit was good, and all mortgage payments to the bank were fully current. The landowner and the neighbor consulted an attorney about their proposed transaction, their desire to complete it, and the bank's refusal to consent. What would the attorney's best advice be?",

The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession. The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?",

The cousin then entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to an investor with the closing to take place \"one week after [the cousin's] next birthday.\" The man failed to convey the farm to the cousin on her birthday. One week after the cousin's birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin's inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise. The investor considered suing the cousin but realized that she could not compel the cousin to convey the farm because it was still owned by the man. Two weeks after the cousin's birthday, the man died. Under his valid will, the man devised the farm to the cousin. Within a week, the executor of the man's estate gave the cousin an executor's deed to the farm in compliance with state law.

The mortgage was properly described in the deed, and the deed was properly executed by the landowner; however, because there was no provision or place in the deed for the developer to sign, he did not do so. The developer promptly recorded the deed. The developer made the monthly mortgage payments of principal and interest for six payments but then stopped payments and defaulted on the mortgage obligation. The lender properly instituted foreclosure procedures in accordance with the governing law. After the foreclosure sale, there was a $10,000 deficiency due to the lender.

Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances. As a result of a title examiner's negligence, this mortgage was not disclosed in the title insurance policy issued to the buyer and the bank.
