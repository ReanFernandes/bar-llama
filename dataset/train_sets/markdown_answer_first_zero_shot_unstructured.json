He set out for the neighbor's house. Before he got there he saw a man who resembled the neighbor. Thinking the man was his neighbor, the defendant shot at the man.

In a prosecution under a statute that proscribes attempt to commit murder, the district attorney should indicate that the intended victim(s) was (were)\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the neighbor only.\nB. the man only.\nC. the child only.\nD. the neighbor and the man.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The defendant's intention to kill his neighbor does not amount to an attempt to commit murder without a voluntary action; thus, A and D are wrong. The mistake of fact that the man was not his neighbor is crucial in this fact pattern. Because of the doctrine of transferred intent, the defendant's intent to kill his neighbor transfers to the man when the defendant mistakes the man for the neighbor. Thus, the defendant had the intent to kill the man AND took affirmative steps to carry out the crime by shooting at him (mens rea AND actus reus). Therefore, the man was an intended victim. With regard to the child, the defendant can likely be prosecuted for shooting the child but not for attempted murder because the defendant did not have the requisite intent. Unlike with the man, where he intended to shoot him, the defendant shot the child purely because of distance and bad aim. Thus, C is incorrect.\n</s>"

The statute makes it a misdemeanor to \"knowingly fail to file\" such a report. The defendant, who is licensed to sell prescription drugs, sold $63,000 worth of prescription drugs during 2006 but did not file the report. Charged with the misdemeanor, the defendant testifies that he did a very poor job of keeping records and did not realize that his sales of prescription drugs had exceeded $50,000. If the jury believes the defendant, he should be found\nAnswer Choices:\nA. guilty, because this is a public welfare offense.\nB. guilty, because he cannot be excused on the basis of his own failure to keep proper records.\nC. not guilty, because the statute punishes omissions and he was not given fair warning of his duty to act.\nD. not guilty, because he was not aware of the value of the drugs he had sold.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The statute itself defines the required mental state by stating that the defendant must \"knowingly\" fail to file the required report. Here, if the jury believes the defendant did not know that he had sold over $50,000 worth of prescription drugs, and thus he did not know that he had to file the report, they should find him not guilty. The mens rea requirement was not met in this case. Answer D is correct.\n</s>"

First degree murder is defined as murder with premeditation and deliberation or a homicide in the commission of arson, rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping. Second degree murder is all other murder at common law. In which of the following situations is the defendant most likely to be guilty of first degree murder?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Immediately after being insulted by the victim, the defendant takes a knife and stabs and kills him.\nB. Angered over having been struck by the victim, the defendant buys rat poison and puts it in the victim's coffee. The victim drinks the coffee and dies as a result.\nC. Intending to injure the victim, the defendant lies in wait and, as the victim comes by, the defendant strikes him with a broom handle. As a result of the blow, the victim dies.\nD.

There are two qualifications for a homicide to fall into the category of first degree murder: specific intent and premeditation or deliberation (as required by the statute). The preceding purchase of rat poison, the implied intent to commit murder, and the inherent deliberation necessary for a poisoning clearly show the defendant's premeditation and deliberation.\n</s>"

She is charged with violation of a state statute which provides, \"Any person who appropriates to his own use property owned by the state shall be guilty of a crime and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for not more than five years, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\" At trial, the camper admits taking the signs but says she believed they had been thrown away. In fact, the signs had not been abandoned. The camper should be found\nAnswer Choices:\nA. guilty, because this is a public welfare offense.\nB. guilty, because she should have inquired whether the signs were abandoned.\nC. not guilty if the jury finds she honestly believed the signs had been abandoned.\nD. not guilty unless the jury finds that the state had taken adequate steps to inform the public that the signs had not been abandoned.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Although there is no mental state requirement for the offense listed in the statute, one will be presumed by the courts to avoid strict liability offenses. In larceny cases, courts will presume the statute requires an intentional act on the part of the defendant. If the jury finds that the camper honestly believed the signs had been abandoned, the camper will not have the presumed requisite mental state and should be found not guilty. Larceny is generally a specific intent crime and, even if the statute does not specifically list it, it will be presumed to require intent as the mental state. If the camper honestly believed the signs had been abandoned, she did not have the requisite mental state to be found guilty. Answer C is correct.\n</s>"

The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found\nAnswer Choices:\nA. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.\nB. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.\nC. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.\nD. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.\n</s>"

The defendant locked the woman in the bathroom while he accepted the jewelry from the maid when she arrived.\nD. The defendant unbuttoned the vest of a man too drunk to notice and removed his wallet.

The defendant pretended to be insulted, slapped the victim, and went off with the wallet.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Robbery is defined at common law as the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. There must be a nexus between the use or threat of force, and the taking. The defendant's unbuttoning of his victims vest is insufficient to be considered the taking by force, and his later slap did not coincide with the taking, but rather was done to aid in his pretending to be insulted. Of the answer choices, choice D has the most tenuous connection between the force or threat of force and the taking of the property.\n</s>"

Factual impossibility arises when the defendant unsuccessfully takes a criminal action, whereas legal impossibility arises when the intended action is not actually a crime. Answer C is the only example of legal impossibility given and is the correct answer. In answer C, it was not illegal to take the actions the defendant did, so, regardless of his intent to commit a crime, it was legally impossible for him to commit the crime. Codeine could be legally purchased, so attempting to purchase it would not be a crime, even if the defendant believed it was.\n</s>"

He got into his car and drove away. Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped his car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store. As he was reaching for a bottle, the night watchman arrived. Startled, the defendant turned and struck the watchman on the head with the bottle, killing him. Only vaguely aware of what was happening, the defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed. He ran a red light and struck and killed a pedestrian who was crossing the street. Relevant statutes define burglary to include \"breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein.\" Manslaughter is defined as the \"killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner.\" Criminal recklessness is \"consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct.\" Murder is defined as the \"the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another during the commission of a rape, robbery, burglary, or arson.\" Another statute provides that intoxication is not a defense to crime unless it negates an element of the offense.

At the defendant's trial for the murder of the watchman, the court should in substance charge the jury on the issue of the defense of intoxication that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. intoxication is a defense to the underlying crime of burglary if the defendant, due to drunkenness, did not form an intent to commit a crime within the building, in which case there can be no conviction for murder unless the defendant intentionally and with premeditation killed the watchman.\nB. voluntary intoxication is not a defense to the crime of murder.\nC. The defendant is guilty of murder despite his intoxication only if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing of the watchman was premeditated and intentional.\nD. voluntary intoxication is a defense to the crime of murder if the defendant would not have killed the watchman but for his intoxication.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The defendant is charged with murder, which means the state must prove either 1) the defendant premeditated and intentionally killed the watchman, or, 2) the murder occurred in the commission of a burglary. As the statute outlines, intoxication is not a defense to a crime unless it negates an element of the offense. Therefore, intoxication would be available as a defense to the burglary charge if it negated the element that the defendant had the intent to commit a theft when he broke and entered the building. Since there are two ways for the jury to possibly find the defendant guilty of murder, the jury must be instructed that the felony-murder way of charging would be unproven if they believed that the defendant was not guilty, by reason of his intoxication, of the burglary, AND the jury must be instructed that, if they so find, the state must prove the defendant premeditated and intentionally killed the watchman. Thus, answer A is correct. The statute regarding intoxication, which controls over common law, indicates it could be a defense to the specific intent crime of burglary, so the jury must be instructed as to the possibility of that defense on the underlying charge of burglary. Without the underlying felony burglary charge, the defendant cannot be found guilty of felony murder.\n</s>"

They customarily sold to anyone unless they suspected the person of being a revenue agent or an informant. One day when one of the brothers was at the distillery alone, he was approached by a buyer who asked to buy a gallon of liquor. The buyer was in fact a revenue officer. After the brother had sold him the liquor, the buyer revealed his identity. The brother grabbed one of the rifles that the brothers kept handy in case of trouble with the law, and shot and wounded the buyer. Other officers, hiding nearby, overpowered and arrested the brother who had shot the buyer. Shortly thereafter, the second brother came on the scene. The officers in hiding had been waiting for him. One of them approached him and asked to buy liquor. The second brother was suspicious and refused to sell. The officers nevertheless arrested him. Both brothers were charged with conspiracy to violate revenue laws, illegal selling of liquor, and battery of the officer. On the charge of battery, which statement concerning the brothers is true?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Neither is guilty.\nB. Both are guilty.\nC. The brother who shot the buyer is guilty but the second brother is not, because the conspiracy had terminated with the arrest of the brother who shot the buyer.\nD. The brother who shot the buyer is guilty but the second brother is not, because the act of the brother who shot the buyer was outside the scope of the conspiracy.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Conspirators are liable for all foreseeable crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. The brothers conspired to operate a distillery, and the battery of a revenue officer was a foreseeable act in furtherance of the conspiracy. The fact that the brothers kept rifles handy in case of trouble with the law shows that the possibility of battery was foreseeable, and therefore the second brother will bear criminal responsibility for the battery. The second brother is criminally responsible for the actions of his brother in committing the battery. Both are guilty.\n</s>"

The defendant's driver's license had expired three months previously; the defendant had neglected to check when it was due to expire.

It is irrelevant that the owner's possession of the property was likely illegal because to commit larceny, the person from whom the property is taken only needs to have ownership, which does not have to be legal. The defendant should be found guilty of larceny. Burglary is defined as the crime of breaking and entering into a structure for the purpose of committing a crime therein. Because the door was open, and the defendant had the owner's permission to be there, he did not break into the dormitory room, and should be found not guilty of burglary.

A person can properly claim self-defense if the action taken is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent harm to himself from the use of unlawful force. In this case, the force the defendant used, a blow to the head, was reasonable in light of the colleague's attacking him with a metal bar. Although he could have escaped, the defendant was not required to do so before using this reasonable force, in part because it wasn't traditionally deadly force. Finally, although the aggressor is not allowed to claim self-defense, in this question the defendant was using words and not a physical attack, so he can properly claim self-defense. The defendant had a proper claim to self-defense and should not be convicted of any crime.\n</s>"

Commonwealth v. Mason. Two sisters see a wealthy neighbor's pedigreed dog on the street. They take the dog home, intending to conceal it until the owner offers a reward. Held, guilty of larceny.\nB. Saferite v. State. Two young men saw a motor car on the street with the keys in the ignition lock.

Using a prior judicial decision as binding authority requires that the two cases be factually analogous and involve the same legal issues. The case in the question involves the taking of property of another when the ultimate intent of the thief is to obtain money. The legal issue is whether the intent to convert the property taken to money is sufficient for a larceny conviction. In answer A, the factual situation involves the taking of another's property with the intent to convert that property into something else with monetary value. The legal issue was whether a conviction is proper when the property taken was taken in an attempt to obtain further money. Answer A is correct.\n</s>"

He frequently experienced hallucinations in the form of hearing divine commands. The man believed God told him several times that the local Roman Catholic bishop was corrupting the diocese into heresy, and that the bishop should be \"done away with.\" The man, a devout Catholic, conceived of himself as a religious martyr. He knew that shooting bishops for heresy is against the criminal law. He nevertheless carefully planned how he might kill the bishop. One evening the man shot the bishop, who was taken to the hospital where he died two weeks later. The man told the police he assumed the institutions of society would support the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and he expected to be persecuted for his God-inspired actions. A psychiatrist examined the man and found that the man suffered from schizophrenic psychosis, that in the absence of this psychosis he would not have shot the bishop, and that because of the psychosis the man found it extremely difficult to determine whether he should obey the specific command that he do away with the bishop or the general commandment \"Thou shalt not kill.\" The man was charged with murder. If the man interposes an insanity defense, and the jurisdiction in which he is tried has adopted only the M'Naghten test of insanity, then the strongest argument for the defense under that test is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The man did not know the nature of the act he was performing.\nB. The man did not know that his act was morally wrong.\nC. The man did not know the quality of the act he was performing.\nD.

The test is whether at the time of committing the act, the accused was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.

A student at the state university offered his English teacher $50 in exchange for a good grade in his English course. The teacher agreed and took the money. The teacher and the student are tried jointly for violation of the state statute. The teacher is charged with violating the statute and the student with aiding and abetting him. The student's best argument for a dismissal of the charge against him is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. a principal and an accessory cannot be tried together, since the principal must be convicted first.\nB. he cannot be an accessory, since he is the victim of the crime.\nC. the legislature did not intend to punish the person giving the thing of value.\nD. he did not assist the teacher in violating the statute.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The best argument the student has is that the statute, by its wording, excludes him as a possible party to the crime, so he cannot be held criminally responsible. For this argument to work, the statute must, by its nature, involve two necessary parties to the crime, with only one of the parties identified in the statute. If the statute leaves the other one unnamed and unpunished, courts will hold that the legislature did not intend to punish the second necessary party, and he thus cannot be liable as an accessory. When a statute specifically names only one party as being criminally liable when there must be at least 2 or more actors to commit the offense, there is a clear indication that the legislature did not intend the other actor to be punished, and a court will not hold that other actor criminally liable. That is the student's best argument for a dismissal here. Answer C is correct.\n</s>"

The witness said, \"No, I have never been convicted of any crime.\" In fact, the witness had pleaded guilty to such a charge and had been placed on probation. The witness was then charged with perjury on the ground that his statement denying the conviction was false. A statute in the jurisdiction defines perjury as knowingly making a false statement while under oath. At trial, the state proved the witness's statement and the prior conviction. The witness testified that the attorney who represented him in the theft case had told him that, because he had been placed on probation, he had not been convicted of a crime.

Acting pursuant to a police department plan to combat crime by randomly stopping automobiles in the area between midnight and 6:00 a.m., a police officer stopped the defendant and asked him for identification. As the defendant handed the officer his license, the officer directed a flashlight into the automobile and saw what appeared to be the barrel of a shotgun protruding from under the front seat on the passenger side of the car.

At the defendant's trial for unlawful possession of narcotics, his motion to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. sustained, because the marijuana was discovered as a result of the unlawful stopping of the defendant's automobile.\nB. sustained, because the use of the flashlight constituted a search of the interior of the defendant's automobile without probable cause.\nC. denied, because the officer's conduct was consistent with the established police plan.\nD. denied, because the discovery of the gun in plain view created the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify the arrest and search of the defendant.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Random stopping of automobiles, even if done in a high crime area, is a violation of the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Since the initial stop of the defendant's vehicle was improper, evidence found as a result of that police misconduct will be suppressed, including the marijuana found on his person. Answer D is incorrect because it ignores the illegality of the initial seizure of the defendant's vehicle. Although the discovery of the gun in plain view may well have justified the search and arrest of the defendant, the marijuana should still be suppressed because of the illegality of the initial stop.\n</s>"

The defendant in answer B is the most likely to be found guilty of common-law murder. The defendant brought a loaded weapon into a liquor store in order to rob it, and because the defendant created a violent situation in which death is foreseeable, the defendant bears criminal responsibility for murder if somebody gets shot, even if the defendant did not intend to kill the person.

After the defendant had been drinking continuously for a three-day period, an elderly woman began to reproach him about his drunken condition, slapping him on the face and shoulders as she did so. The defendant believed that he was being unmercifully attacked and heard the hallucinatory voice telling him to strangle his assailant. He did so, and she died. If the defendant is charged with second degree murder, the defendant's best chance of acquittal would be to rely on a defense of\nAnswer Choices:\nA. intoxication.\nB. lack of malice aforethought.\nC. self-defense.\nD. insanity.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n At common law, second degree murder is the killing of a human being with malice aforethought but without premeditation and deliberation. The defendant's best defense to a charge of second degree murder is that he was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was insane at the time of the killing. Auditory hallucinations and the belief that he was being unmercifully attacked may show that he was acting under a mental illness which caused a defect in reasoning such that the defendant did not know that his actions were wrong. The defendant believed, because of the hallucinations, that he was properly acting in self-defense and that he should kill his assailant. He could properly raise an insanity defense, and it is his best chance of acquittal.\n</s>"

He pushed the wife against the wall of a nearby building, held the gun to her head, and demanded money from the husband. The husband handed over his cash. The defendant grabbed the cash and ran away.

Robbery is the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. In this question, the defendant, having the clear intent to deprive the husband of his money, used the threat of force against the wife to obtain the property. The threatened force need not be toward the owner of the property; it may also be toward another party. Answer A is the most serious offense listed and is correct.\n</s>"

He decided to go into Walters' house to take Walters' silverware and then to sell it. That night, while Walters' was away, Damson entered by picking the lock on the front door. He picked up a chest of silverware from the dining room and went out the front door of the house to his car. As he was putting the chest of silverware into the trunk, he had second thoughts and decided that he did not wish to become a thief. He reentered the house and replaced the chest of silverware where he had found it. As he came out of the house the second time, he was arrested by the police, who had been called by a neighbor. Damson is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. guilty of burglary and larceny.\nB. guilty of burglary and attempted larceny.\nC. guilty of burglary but not guilty of any larceny offense.\nD. not guilty of burglary or any larceny offense.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Damson broke and entered Walter's dwelling at night with the intent to commit a felony and larceny, so he is guilty of burglary. Damson also took the property of another, Walter's silverware, and carried it away with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, so he is guilty of larceny. The fact that Damson changed his mind about crime after he had committed them does not negate any of the offenses of either charge, because when Damson broke and entered, and took and carried away the property, he had the intent to permanently deprive the owner. Withdrawal may be a defense to a part of a conspiracy charge, but not to a substantive charge, such as larceny and burglary, where the crime had already been committed. Answer B is incorrect because when Damson committed the larceny, the charge of attempted larceny merged into the larceny charge. Answer C is incorrect because Damson did commit both burglary, for breaking and entering with the intent to commit the larceny, and the larceny itself, by taking the property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner. Whereas the attempted larceny and larceny will merge, the burglary and larceny will not merge, because they are separate offenses, with different elements in each one. Answer D is incorrect because the crimes were committed, and later reconsideration of the crimes is not a proper defense. Damson is guilty of both burglary and larceny.\n</s>"

The courts have interpreted this statute as creating a strict liability offense that does not require knowledge of the age of the purchaser and as creating vicarious liability. A minor, who was sixteen years old, but looked four or five years older, entered a store and asked a clerk for a box of .22 caliber shells. The store owner had instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors. The clerk asked the minor his age. The minor said he was twenty. The clerk then placed a box of shells on the counter and asked, \"Anything else?\" The minor said that was all he wanted but then discovered he did not have enough money to pay for the shells, so the clerk put the box back onto the shelf. If the owner of the store is charged with attempting to violate the statute, her best argument would be that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. it was impossible for the sale to have occurred.\nB. she had strictly instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors.\nC. the minor lied about his age.\nD. the clerk did not have the mental state needed for attempt.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n To be convicted of attempt, a person must have the intent that the crime be committed, and take a substantial step toward the commission of the offense.

It was the action of having the friend set fire to the building, and not the conspiracy or the fraud, which resulted in the vagrant's death. Although common law required the burning to be of a dwelling of another, most states extend arson to structures other than a dwelling, even if the defendant owns it.

To improve the appearance of his office, he decided to purchase some new furniture and to pay for it out of future earnings. Wearing an expensive suit borrowed from a friend, the lawyer went to a furniture store and asked to purchase on credit a desk and various other items of furniture. The lawyer told the store owner that he was a very able lawyer with a growing practice and that he expected to do very well in the future. The store owner agreed to sell him the items on credit, and the lawyer promised to make monthly payments of $800. The lawyer has never had an income from his practice of more than $150 a month. The lawyer's business did not improve, and he did not make any payments to the furniture store. After three months, the store owner repossessed the items.

The stranger had been drinking and mistakenly thought the police officer was a man who was having an affair with his wife. Intending to frighten the police officer but not to harm him, the stranger pulled out a knife, screamed obscenities, and told the police officer he was going to kill him. Frightened and reasonably believing the stranger was going to kill him and that using deadly force was his only salvation, the police officer took out his service revolver and shot and killed the stranger. The police officer is charged with murder. The police officer's claim of self-defense should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. sustained, because the police officer reasonably believed the stranger was planning to kill him and that deadly force was required.\nB. sustained, because the killing was in hot blood upon sufficient provocation.\nC. denied, because the stranger did not in fact intend to harm the police officer and the police officer was incorrect in believing that he did.\nD. denied, because the police officer was not defending his home and had an obligation to retreat or to repel with less than deadly force.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n In order to succeed in a claim of self-defense to a murder charge, the defendant must show that the defendant believed that the action taken was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself from unlawful force, and that the belief was reasonable.

When one of the devices broke down and the speeder was arrested, he confessed that he often sped, secure in the knowledge that his \"SuperTrucker\" would warn him of police radar in the vicinity. Held: The defendant guilty as an accomplice to speeding. CASE B: The defendant told a man that the defendant had stored some stereo equipment in a self-storage locker. He gave the man a key and asked the man to pick up the equipment and deliver it to the defendant's house. The man complied, and removed the equipment from the locker, using the key. In fact, the equipment belonged to the defendant's neighbor, whose locker key the defendant had found in the driveway. Held: The defendant guilty as an accomplice to burglary. CASE C: A city council member accepted a bribe from the defendant in exchange for his vote on the defendant's application for a zoning variance. A statute prohibits the taking of bribes by public officials. Held: The defendant not guilty as an accomplice to the city council member's violation of the bribery statute. CASE D: The defendant, an innkeeper, sometimes let his rooms to prostitutes, whom he knew to be using the rooms to ply their trade. He charged the prostitutes the same price as other guests at his inn. Held: The defendant not guilty as an accomplice to prostitution. A college student purchased narcotics from a dealer whom he believed to be a \"street person\" but who was in fact an undercover police agent. The student has been charged as an accomplice to the sale of narcotics.

Each of the four decisional law cases listed in the question have different relationships between the parties and emphasize a different aspect of accomplice liability. Case A involves a provider/customer relationship and illustrates that the defendant is guilty as an accomplice if he provides a customer direct means to avoid detection in the commission of an offense. Case B involves a case where the defendant aids an unwitting person, who lacks the requisite mental state, but takes actions that would have been a crime had the defendant done it himself. Case B illustrates that a defendant can be found guilty as an accomplice even though the person taking the actions would be not guilty of the offense. Case C involves a co-conspirator relationship and illustrates that a defendant cannot be found guilty as an accomplice to a crime that the co-conspirator would be found guilty of committing. Case D involves a provider/customer relationship, and illustrates that the defendant would not be guilty as an accomplice for providing a place for an offense to occur.\n</s>"

A few minutes later, two police officers saw a pickup truck fitting the description a half block from the high school. The driver of the truck matched the description of one of the men described by the undercover officer. The only passenger was a young woman who was in the back of the truck. The police saw her get out and stand at a nearby bus stop. They stopped the truck and searched the driver. In the pocket of the driver's jacket, the police found a small bottle of pills that they recognized as narcotics.

The fuse failed to ignite and the building was not harmed.Arson is defined in this jurisdiction as \"the intentional burning of any building or structure of another, without the consent of the owner.\" The warehouse owner believed, however, that burning one's own building was arson, having been so advised by his lawyer. Has the warehouse owner committed attempted arson?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because factual impossibility is no defense.\nB.

Because he owned the building and consented to the burning, it was legally impossible for him to commit the crime of arson. Legal impossibility is a defense to an attempt charge, so the owner did not commit attempted arson.\n</s>"

The defendant mistakenly thought the victim had raised his hand to shoot, when, in fact, the victim was shaking his fist at the defendant to frighten him.\nC. The defendant was charged with assault with intent to rape a woman whom he mistakenly believed had agreed to have sexual intercourse with him.\nD. The defendant was charged with burglary. He had broken into an office where he once worked and had taken a typewriter that he erroneously believed had been given to him before he was fired.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n At common law, bigamy is a strict liability crime, and a mistake of fact will not serve as a defense to strict liability crimes. In addition, mistake of law is, in general, never a valid defense. A mistake may only be a valid defense if it creates another defense, or if it acts to negate the mental state requirement of the offense. The defendant in answer A knowingly married a person who was already married, thereby committing the strict liability offense of bigamy, and the defendant's mistaken belief that he was allowed to marry her is no defense.\n</s>"

However, the etching was a photocopy of an original that had been loaned to another museum. A sign over the display case containing the photocopy said that similar photocopies were available free at the entrance. The defendant did not see the sign. Burglary in the jurisdiction is defined as \"entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime.\" The defendant is guilty of\nAnswer Choices:\nA. burglary and larceny.\nB. burglary and attempted larceny.\nC. larceny.\nD. attempted larceny.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The charge of burglary in the question's jurisdiction requires that the defendant entered the building unlawfully and with the intent to commit a crime.

Because the defendant's entry was not \"unlawful,\" he cannot be guilty of the charge of burglary. Larceny, at common law, requires the taking of personal property with the intent to deprive the owner of it, against the owner's wishes. The defendant, with the intent to steal, took the photocopy of the etching from its display case, and concealed it.

Malice does not require the intent to kill; in some cases, there may be \"implied malice\" if there was gross or extreme recklessness to human life on the part of the defendant. In the question, the teller, knowing the man to be violent and jealous, lied to him, and suggested he commit murder. By taking actions that ensured the man would be walking into a heavily guarded bank with a gun, the teller acted with extreme recklessness; this is enough to show implied malice aforethought. Therefore, the teller should be found guilty of murder. An additional facet of the question raises the issue of whether the teller was a \"proximate cause\" of the man's death. The general test is whether the death was foreseeable; a defendant will be held criminally liable for the foreseeable consequences of their actions. In this case, by ensuring the man would enter a heavily guarded bank with the intent to kill the president and armed with a gun, it was foreseeable that the man would be killed.\n</s>"

Thereafter, the defendant, with his counsel, appeared in court for arraignment and stated that he wished to plead guilty. The presiding judge asked the defendant whether he understood the nature of the charges, possible defenses, and maximum allowable sentences. The defendant replied that he did, and the judge reviewed all of those matters with him. He then asked the defendant whether he understood that he did not have to plead guilty.

A police officer arrested the defendant and informed her of what the warrant stated. However, hoping that the defendant might say something incriminating, he did not give her Miranda warnings. He placed her in the back seat of his patrol car and was driving her to the police station when she said, \"Look, I didn't mean to burn the building; it was an accident. I was just burning some papers in a wastebasket.\" At the station, after being given Miranda warnings, the defendant stated that she wished to remain silent and made no other statements. The defendant moved to suppress the use of her statement to the police officer as evidence on two grounds: first, that the statement was acquired without giving Miranda warnings, and second, that the police officer had deliberately elicited her incriminating statement after she was in custody. As to the defendant's motion to suppress, the court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. deny the motion.\nB. grant the motion only on the basis of the first ground stated.\nC. grant the motion only on the basis of the second ground stated.\nD. grant the motion on either ground.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Miranda warnings need to be given only if the person is subject to custodial interrogation. The defendant was in custody pursuant to the warrant; however, she was never subject to interrogation. Her voluntary statement in the vehicle to the officer should not be suppressed on the ground that the officer failed to give her the Miranda warnings. Merely hoping for incriminating statements is insufficient action by the officer to be considered an interrogation for Miranda purposes. The officer did not ask any questions, he did not deliberately elicit any statement, and the statement was knowingly and voluntarily made.\n</s>"

A man is charged with the rape of a woman. At trial, the woman testifies to facts sufficient for a jury to find that the man had sexual intercourse with her, that she did not consent, and that the two were not married. The man testifies in his own defense that he believed she consented to sexual intercourse and that she was his common-law wife. At the conclusion of the case, the court instructed the jury that in order to find the man guilty of rape, it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had sexual intercourse with the woman without her consent. The court also instructed the jury that it should find the defendant not guilty if it found either that the woman was the man's wife or that the man reasonably believed that the woman had consented to the sexual intercourse, but that the burden of persuasion as to these issues was on the defendant. The jury found the man guilty, and the man appealed, contending that the court's instructions on the issues of whether the woman was his wife and whether he reasonably believed she had consented violated his constitutional rights.

However, the instruction that shifted the burden of persuasion to the man to prove his belief that the woman had consented was reasonable and did not violate the man's constitutional rights. The state must prove all of the elements of rape beyond a reasonable doubt. Any jury instruction that shifts the burden at all to the defendant on any of those elements violates the man's right to a fair trial. The three elements in the rape charge are: 1) has sexual intercourse 2) with a female who is not his wife 3) without her consent. All three must be proven by the state beyond a reasonable doubt. The instruction that stated the burden of persuasion shifts to the defense to prove the woman was not his wife was an improper shifting of the burden and is unconstitutional.\n</s>"

The child labor laws in the jurisdiction provide, \"It is a violation of the law for one to employ a person under the age of 17 years for full-time labor.\" Without the general manager's knowledge, the supervising manager hired a number of 15- and 16-year-olds to work at the mill full time. He did not ask their ages and they did not disclose them. The supervising manager could have discovered their ages easily by asking for identification, but he did not do so because he was not aware of the law and believed that company policy was to hire young people. If the statute is interpreted to create strict liability and the general manager is convicted of violating it, his contention that his conviction would violate the federal Constitution is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. correct, because it is a violation of due procees to punish without a voluntary act.\nB. correct, because criminal liability is personal and the knitting mill is the employer of the children, not the general manager.\nC. incorrect, because regulatory offenses are not subject to due process limitations.\nD. incorrect, because he was in a position to exercise control over the hiring employees for the knitting mill.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Because the general manager is the CEO and the person who delegated the authority to the supervising manager, he will bear criminal responsibility for the actions of his agents who are acting on his behalf. Because the general manager had control over the hiring of employees for the knitting mill, and he delegated that authority to the supervising manager, he is responsible for the actions taken in the hiring of children by his agent. The offense is a strict liability crime and neither the general manager nor the supervising manager needs to have actual knowledge that the children were under the age of 17. Answer A is incorrect because the general manager is criminally responsible for the actions of his agents; there is no violation of due process even if he did not do the act of hiring the children himself. Assigning the responsibility to his agent was a sufficient actus reus for criminal liability. Answer B is incorrect because corporate officers, such as the general manager and the supervising manager, can be held criminally liable for strict liability crimes involving corporations. Although the named employer is the knitting mill, the supervising manager, as the hirer, and the general manager, as his superior, will bear responsibility for those corporate actions in strict liability crimes. Answer C is incorrect because even regulatory offenses are subject to certain due process limitations. Because the general manager had the authority to hire the children, and he specifically delegated that authority to the supervising manager, he will bear criminal responsibility for the supervising manager's actions that violated the strict liability crime of hiring children.\n</s>"

Manslaughter is defined by the common law. At 2 a.m., the defendant held up an all-night liquor store using an assault rifle. During the holdup, two police cars with flashing lights drove up in front of the store.

The defendant suffers from a neurological problem that makes it impossible for him to remember an occurrence for longer than 48 hours. After the defendant was charged, the police visited him and asked if they might search his home. The defendant consented. The police found a diary written by the defendant. An entry dated the same day as the victim's disappearance read, \"Indescribable excitement. Why did no one ever tell me that killing gave such pleasure to the master?\" The defendant was charged with murder. His attorney has moved to exclude the diary from evidence on the ground that its admission would violate the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. Counsel has also argued that the defendant could not give informed consent to the search because more than 48 hours had passed since the making of the entry and hence he could not remember the existence of the incriminating entry at the time he gave his consent. There is no evidence that the police officers who secured the defendant's consent to the search were aware of his memory impairment. With regard to the diary, the court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. admit it, because the defendant's consent was not obtained by intentional police misconduct and the defendant was not compelled to make the diary entry.\nB. admit it, pursuant to the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.\nC. exclude it, because the defendant was not competent to consent to a search.\nD. exclude it, because use of the diary as evidence would violate the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The exclusionary rule serves to protect persons from illegal police conduct. There is no evidence that the police had acted improperly, and they had, in fact, obtained consent for the search.

The defendant agreed to drive to the bank and to wait outside while the friend went in to rob it. As they approached the bank, the defendant began to regret his agreement to help with the robbery. Once there, the friend got out of the car. As the friend went out of sight inside the bank, the defendant drove away and went home.

If the killing is foreseeable from the actions, then an accomplice can be convicted of felony murder. However, the death penalty will be considered a disproportional sentence if the defendant is a minor participant and was completely lacking in the intent to kill or cause great bodily harm. In this case, the defendant's aiding and abetting the friend by agreeing to drive the getaway car, driving the friend to the bank, and knowing that the friend intended to rob it, makes him guilty of the felony murder charge. However, the defendant's lack of intent to kill, his driving off after dropping the friend off, and his turning himself in after the fact, indicate that a sentence of death would be disproportional and unconstitutional.\n</s>"

Early one morning, armed with a pistol, he crouched behind some bushes on a park hillside overlooking a path upon which his neighbor frequently jogged. On this morning, however, the defendant saw his neighbor jogging on another path about a half mile away. Nonetheless, the defendant fired five shots at his neighbor. None of the five shots came anywhere close to the neighbor as he was well out of the range of pistol the defendant was using. The defendant is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. guilty of attempted murder, if he was not aware of the limited range of his pistol.\nB. guilty of attempted murder, if a reasonable person would not have been aware of the limited range of his pistol.\nC. not guilty of attempted murder, or any lesser included offense, because, under the circumstances, it was impossible for him to have killed his neighbor.\nD. not guilty of attempted murder, but guilty of assault.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n To be found guilty of attempted murder, a defendant must have the intent to commit murder, and take a substantial step toward the commission of murder. In this question, the defendant had, prior to the shooting, the intent to kill his neighbor, and took the substantial step of firing the weapon at the neighbor. He is guilty of attempted murder. However, if the defendant was aware that it was impossible for his shots to actually reach his neighbor, it cannot be said that the defendant, by shooting at his neighbor, had the intent and took a substantial step to kill the neighbor. If the defendant was unaware of the limited range of his pistol, however, he can be convicted of attempted murder.\n</s>"

The defendant drew a knife and stabbed the sports fan in the stomach. Other people then stepped in and stopped any further fighting. Despite the pleas of the other people, the sports fan refused to go to a hospital or to seek medical treatment. About two hours later, he died as the result of a loss of blood. The defendant was charged with the murder of the sports fan. At trial, medical evidence established that if the sports fan had been taken to a hospital, he would have survived. At the end of the case, the defendant moves for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, for an instruction on the elements of voluntary manslaughter. The court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. grant the motion for acquittal.\nB. deny the motion for acquittal, but instruct on manslaughter because there is evidence of adequate provocation.\nC. deny both motions, because the defendant failed to retreat.\nD. deny both motions, because malice may be proved by the intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The defendant's motion for acquittal should be denied because there is sufficient evidence for the jury to find the defendant guilty of murder. The sports fan's refusal to seek medical treatment is an insufficient intervening act to allow the defendant to escape criminal liability for stabbing the sports fan. Whether an intervening act is sufficient to break the chain of causality in a homicide cases rests on the foreseeability of the intervening act. A defendant will be held criminally responsible for the foreseeable consequences of his actions; however, if an unforeseeable act intervenes, a defendant will not be deemed responsible for the death. The defendant stabbed the sports fan in the stomach, and as a result of the injury, the sports fan died. A refusal to get medical treatment by the victim is foreseeable and is insufficient to allow the defendant to escape criminal responsibility for his actions. The motion for judgment of acquittal should be denied.\n</s>"

He went out into the country to an area where he had previously hunted. Much to his surprise, he noticed that the area beyond a clearing contained several newly constructed houses that had not been there before. Between the houses there was a small playground where several children were playing. Nevertheless, the marksman nailed a paper target to a tree and went to a point where the tree was between himself and the playground. He then fired several shots at the target. One of the shots missed the target and the tree and hit and killed one of the children in the playground. The marksman was convicted of murder. He appealed, contending that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction of murder. The appellate court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. affirm the conviction, because the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction of murder.\nB. reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial, because the evidence is not sufficient for murder but will support a conviction of voluntary manslaughter.\nC. reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial, because the evidence is not sufficient for murder but will support a conviction of involuntary manslaughter.\nD. reverse the conviction and order the case dismissed, because the evidence is sufficient only for a finding of negligence and negligence alone cannot support a criminal conviction.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n When determining the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a charge, the appellate court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the state. In this case, the marksman placed his target so that, if he missed, he would be shooting in the direction of the children; he fired numerous shots from a rifle in the direction of an occupied playground and killed a child. Even though he did not have the intent to kill, the evidence is sufficient for a jury to find that the marksman acted with extreme recklessness toward human life, which is sufficient for a finding of malice aforethought for the murder conviction. The appellate court should affirm the conviction of murder.\n</s>"

That regulation prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of 18 and also prohibits the sale of any alcoholic beverage to a person over the age of 17 and under the age of 22 without the presentation of such person's driver's license or other identification showing the age of the purchaser to be 18 or older. The evidence showed that the bartender worked in a tavern and sold a bottle of beer to a person who was 17 years old and that the bartender did not ask for or see the purchaser's driver's license or any other identification. Which of the following, if found by the jury, would be of the most help to the bartender?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The purchaser had a driver's license that falsely showed his age to be 21.\nB. The bartender had never been told he was supposed to check identification of persons over 17 and under 22 before selling them alcohol.\nC. The bartender did not know that the regulations classified beer as an alcoholic beverage.\nD. The bartender mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The regulation stating that bartenders must require people between the ages of 18 and 21 to show identification of their age carries with it the implication that people above the age of 21 are not required to show identification. The bartender's best argument is that, since he mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old, he was allowed to sell them beer and was not required to obtain identification; in relying on that statute, he did not ascertain the minor's age. This may allow him to argue that the regulation contains a mens rea element requiring that he knowingly violate the law. Because the bartender did not knowingly sell alcohol to the minor, he should be acquitted.\n</s>"

The man, who had no money except for the check and who needed cash to pay for food and a place to sleep, became agitated.

The victim was rushed to the hospital where she lapsed into a coma. Despite the explanation that he was trying to revive the victim after she suddenly collapsed, the defendant was charged with attempted rape and assault after a neighbor informed the police that she had heard the victim sobbing, \"No, please no, let me alone.\" At trial, the forensic evidence was inconclusive. The jury acquitted the defendant of attempted rape but convicted him of assault. While he was serving his sentence for assault, the victim, who had never recovered from the coma, died. The defendant was then indicted and tried on a charge of felony murder. In this common-law jurisdiction, there is no statute that prevents a prosecutor from proceeding in this manner, but the defendant argued that a second trial for attempted rape and assault would violate the double jeopardy clause. His claim is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. correct, because he was acquitted of the attempted rape charge.\nB. correct, because he was convicted of the assault charge.\nC. incorrect, because the victim had not died at the time of the first trial and he was not placed in jeopardy for murder.\nD. incorrect, because he was convicted of the assault charge.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The attempted rape charge cannot be the basis for the felony-murder charge because the defendant has been acquitted of the charge and to use it would violate the double jeopardy clause. The double jeopardy clause forbids the state from prosecuting, or punishing, a defendant twice for the same action. In this case, the defendant was placed in jeopardy during the original trial for attempted rape, and to use that charge again as the underlying felony in a felony murder charge would put him in jeopardy again. Assault, at common law, is not a felony and cannot be used as the basis for a felony-murder charge.\n</s>"

He described the informant as a cocaine user who had previously supplied accurate information concerning the use of cocaine in the community and summarized what the informant had told him as follows: the previous night, October 21, the informant was in the defendant's house at the particular address. The defendant gave her cocaine. She also saw three cellophane bags containing cocaine in his bedroom. The warrant was issued and a search of the address was conducted on October 22. The search turned up a quantity of marijuana but no cocaine. The defendant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. The defendant moved to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence contending that the informant was not in the particular address on October 21 or at any other time. If, after hearing evidence, the judge concludes that the statement in the application attributed to the informant is incorrect, the judge should grant the motion to suppress\nAnswer Choices:\nA. because the application contains a material statement that is false.\nB. because of the false statement and because no cocaine was found in the house.\nC. only if he also finds that the informant's statement was a deliberate lie.\nD. only if he also finds that the police officer knew the statement was false.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Even if the information included in a search warrant is incorrect, the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant will not be excluded from evidence unless there is evidence that the officer knew the information was false. The exclusionary rule is meant to prevent law enforcement officers from acting improperly, but if the officer acted in good faith reliance on the warrant, the evidence will not be suppressed. Thus, unless the police officer knew that the warrant contained false information, the evidence will be admissible and the motion to suppress will be denied.\n</s>"

At the defendant's trial for murder, he pleaded insanity. The state put on an expert psychiatrist who had examined the defendant. He testified that, in his opinion, the defendant was sane at the time of the murder. The defendant's attorney did not introduce expert testimony on the question of sanity. Rather, he presented lay witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the defendant was insane at the time of the murder. At the end of the trial, each side moves for a directed verdict on the question of sanity. Which of the following correctly describes the judge's situation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

At the center, one of the young children often arrived with bruises and welts on his back and legs. A statute in the jurisdiction requires all day-care workers to report to the police cases where there is probable cause to suspect child abuse and provides for immediate removal from the home of any suspected child abuse victims. The employee was not aware of this statute. Nevertheless, he did report the child's condition to his supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day-care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent. About two weeks after the the employee first noticed the child's condition, the child was beaten to death by his father. The employee has been charged with murder in the death of the child. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the child had been the victim of beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that the employee had seen. The child's mother had been aware of the beatings but had not stopped them because she was herself afraid of the child's father.

In desperation, he decided to set fire to his store to collect the insurance. While looking through the basement for flammable material, he lit a match to read the label on a can. The match burned his finger and, in a reflex action, he dropped the match. It fell into a barrel and ignited some paper. The defendant made no effort to put out the fire but instead left the building. The fire spread and the store was destroyed by fire. The defendant was eventually arrested and indicted for arson. The defendant is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. guilty, if he could have put out the fire before it spread and did not do so because he wanted the building destroyed.\nB. guilty, if he was negligent in starting the fire.\nC. not guilty, because even if he wanted to burn the building there was no concurrence between his mens rea and the act of starting the fire.\nD. not guilty, because his starting the fire was the result of a reflex action and not a voluntary act.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Arson is the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Although the defendant's actions do not appear to conform to the common law definition of arson, there are two important qualifications to remember. The first is that the element of \"dwelling\" is often disregarded and the definition extends to any structure. Second, under the crime of arson is the subset crime of houseburning. Houseburning is the malicious burning of one's own dwelling if the dwelling is situated so near to other dwellings as to create danger to them. As with the general definition of arson, the term \"dwelling\" is liberally construed to include all structures. In this way, the defendant can be found guilty of arson for burning his own store. Further, arson is not a specific intent crime. Malicious burning does not require proof of intent; malice can be implied in the presence extreme recklessness. The burning need not be intentional, as long as it is foreseeable from the defendant's actions. The defendant in this case, by looking for flammable material with a match, and eventually setting papers in a barrel on fire, was acting with malice. The burning that occurred, although initially done by reflex, was foreseeable from the defendant's actions. The defendant's refusal to put out the fire, combined with his intent that the building be destroyed, makes him guilty of arson.\n</s>"

The girlfriend did so. Several students were injured in the panic that followed as people were trying to get out of the building. The student and the girlfriend are prosecuted for battery and for conspiracy to commit battery. They are\nAnswer Choices:\nA. guilty of both crimes.\nB. guilty of battery but not guilty of conspiracy.\nC. not guilty of battery but guilty of conspiracy.\nD. not guilty of either crime.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n At common law, battery is a general intent crime and is defined as the unlawful offensive touching of another. The girlfriend and the student as her accessory, by pulling the fire alarm, caused many of the students to be offensively touched to the point of injury. These unlawful touchings were completely foreseeable from the pulling of the fire alarm, and they were the direct result of the student and his girlfriend's intentional act. Because battery is a general intent crime, the student and his girlfriend are guilty of battery. Conspiracy to commit battery, on the other hand, is a specific intent crime and requires an agreement to commit the crime of battery. For a proper conspiracy charge, both parties must reach an agreement and intend that the crime of battery be committed. Because conspiracy is a specific intent crime, there must be proof that both the student and his girlfriend specifically intended for people to be the victims of criminal battery. In this case, although the batteries were a foreseeable consequence of their actions, the student and his girlfriend did not have the specific intent that the batteries occur. Instead, they intended that the student get out of a final exam. The student and his girlfriend should be found not guilty of the offense of conspiracy to commit battery. Therefore answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The defendant was the president of an aspirin manufacturing company. A federal inspector discovered that a large number of aspirin tablets randomly scattered through several bottles in a carton ready for shipment were laced with arsenic. The defendant is charged with attempted introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\nB. The defendant struck the victim in the face with a baseball bat, intending to inflict a serious injury. The victim died after being hospitalized for three days. The defendant is charged with murder.\nC. The defendant burglarized a jewelry store, intending to steal some diamonds. As he entered the store, he short-circuited the store's burglar alarm system, thereby preventing a warning of his entry to police. The smoldering wires eventually caused a fire that destroyed the store. The defendant is charged with arson.\nD. The defendant wanted to frighten the victim's friend by placing a plastic rattlesnake in his lunch box. When the victim mistakenly took the lunch box and opened it, believing it to be his own, the plastic rattlesnake popped out. As a result of the fright, the victim suffered a heart attack and died. The defendant is charged with manslaughter.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Although the defendant intended only to commit serious injury, he should be convicted of murder. At common law, murder is a crime defined as the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied in actions that show gross recklessness toward human life. The defendant had the stated intent to commit serious injury, which is sufficient to show the defendant unlawfully killed the victim with malice aforethought. The defendant should be convicted of murder. Answer A is incorrect because a charge of attempt requires the defendant have the intent that the underlying crime be committed, and take a substantial step in the commission of the offense. There is no evidence that the defendant in answer A had the intent to introduce adulterated drugs into interstate commerce, or that he took substantial steps toward the commission of that offense. Answer C is incorrect because arson requires the malicious burning of the real property of another, and, although malice is not a specific intent crime, it means that the burning must be intentional or foreseeable. In answer C, the burning was not intentionally done, and the smoldering wires causing a fire will be found unforeseeable. Answer D is incorrect because manslaughter requires either the reckless or negligent killing of another. In answer D, the actions the defendant took were neither reckless nor negligent and would not be enough to sustain a conviction for manslaughter. Because malice aforethought is specifically defined to include the intent to cause serious bodily injury, the defendant in answer B is most likely to be convicted.\n</s>"

Angered by what he considered to be an unjust accusation, the employee waited until the manager left the room and then reached into the still open safe, took the bag containing the cash, and left.

The supervisor decided to give the employee the watch for his birthday the following week. On the weekend before the employee's birthday, the employee and supervisor attended a company picnic. The supervisor took his watch off and left it on a blanket when he went off to join in a touch football game. The employee strolled by, saw the watch on the blanket, and decided to steal it. He bent over and picked up the watch. Before he could pocket it, however, his supervisor returned. When he saw the employee holding the watch, he said, \"I know how much you like that watch.

The statute requires a junkyard owner or operator to permit representatives of the Department of Motor Vehicles or any law enforcement agency upon request during normal business hours to take physical inventory of motor vehicles and parts thereof on the premises. The statute also states that a failure to comply with any of its requirements constitutes a felony. Police officers assigned to a particular city's automobile crimes unit periodically visited all motor vehicle junkyards in town to make the inspections permitted by the statute. A woman owned such a business in the city. One summer day, the officers asked to inspect the vehicles on her lot. The woman said, \"Do I have a choice?\" The officers told her she did not. The officers conducted their inspection and discovered three stolen automobiles. The woman is charged with receiving stolen property. She moves pretrial to suppress the evidence relating to the three automobiles on the ground that the inspection was unconstitutional. The woman's motion should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. sustained, because the statute grants unbridled discretion to law enforcement officers to make warrantless searches.\nB. sustained, because the stated regulatory purpose of the statute is a pretext to circumvent the warrant requirement in conducting criminal investigations.\nC. denied, because the statute deals reasonably with a highly regulated industry.\nD. denied, because administrative searches of commercial establishments do not require warrants.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Because owners and operators of commercial properties in highly regulated industries have a lower expectation of privacy, and because the state's interest in the regulations are heightened, warrantless inspections of those commercial properties will be found reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has ruled that as long as there is a high governmental interest at stake, the warrantless inspections are necessary to further those interests, and the statute allowing the inspections serves the same functions as a warrant, then evidence found pursuant to those searches should not be suppressed. In Burger v. New York, the Supreme Court found the searches pursuant to the regulation of the automobile junkyard industry to be valid.\n</s>"

She included details that would lead knowledgeable readers to believe that the letter had been written by Thomas Jefferson to a friend. The calligrapher, who had a facsimile of Jefferson's autograph, made the signature and other writing on the letter resemble Jefferson's. She knew that the letter would attract the attention of local collectors. When it did and she was contacted about selling it, she said that it had come into her hands from a foreign collector who wished anonymity, and that she could make no promises about its authenticity. As she had hoped, a collector paid her $5,000 for the letter. Later the collector discovered the letter was not authentic, and handwriting analysis established that the calligrapher had written the letter. In a jurisdiction that follows the common-law definition of forgery, the calligrapher has\nAnswer Choices:\nA. committed both forgery and false pretenses.\nB. committed forgery, because she created a false document with the intent to defraud, but has not committed false pretenses, since she made no representation as to the authenticity of the document.\nC. not committed forgery, because the document had no apparent legal significance, but has committed false pretenses, since she misrepresented the source of the document.\nD. not committed forgery, because the document had no apparent legal significance, and has not committed false pretenses, since she has made no representation as to authenticity of the document.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n At common law, false pretenses is obtaining the possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. At common law, forgery is the false making or material alteration of a writing where the writing has the apparent ability to defraud and is of apparent legal efficacy with the intent to defraud. The calligrapher did not commit forgery, because the document, by itself, has no legal efficacy or significance, it was merely purporting to be a letter. However, the calligrapher did commit false pretense because she obtained the property and title to property, the $5,000, by fraud and misrepresentation, and she had the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. Even though she did not specifically promise anything about the letter's authenticity, the calligrapher misrepresented the nature of the letter by saying it was from a collector rather than created by herself; she misrepresented who owned the letter, and how she obtained the letter. Those misrepresentations induced the buyer into giving her the money.\n</s>"

The victim then pointed the gun at the defendant's head and pulled the trigger once. The gun did not fire. The defendant then took the gun, pointed it at the victim, spun the barrel, and pulled the trigger once. The gun fired, and the victim fell over dead. A statute in the jurisdiction defines murder in the first degree as an intentional and premeditated killing or one occurring during the commission of a common-law felony, and murder in the second degree as all other murder at common law. Manslaughter is defined as a killing in the heat of passion upon an adequate legal provocation or a killing caused by gross negligence. The most serious crime for which the defendant can properly be convicted is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. murder in the first degree, because the killing was intentional and premeditated and, in any event, occurred during commission of the felony of assault with a deadly weapon.\nB. murder in the second degree, because the defendant's act posed a great threat of serious bodily harm.\nC. manslaughter, because the defendant's act was grossly negligent and reckless.\nD. no crime, because the victim and the defendant voluntarily agreed to play a game and each assumed the risk of death.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The defendant's pointing a loaded weapon at the victim and pulling the trigger posed a great threat of serious bodily injury to the victim, and, because it resulted in the victim's death, the defendant should be convicted of murder in the second degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with malice aforethought, done without premeditation and deliberation.

One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to the suspect's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to the suspect's house. The police knocked on the suspect's door and called out, \"Police. Open up. We have a search warrant.\" After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found the suspect with a large brown suitcase and put handcuffs on the suspect. A search of his person revealed a switchblade knife and a .45-caliber pistol. The suspect cursed the police and said, \"You never would have caught me with the stuff if it hadn't been for that lousy snitch Harvey!\" The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every room and closet.

Answer B is incorrect because a failure to read the Miranda warnings will lead to the suppression of statements only if those statements were obtained as a result of a custodial interrogation. In this case, the suspect, while he may have been in custody, was not subject to interrogation. Answer D is a misstatement of the law regarding the admissibility of a defendant's confession. The fact that the police's presence was authorized does not, in itself, have a bearing on whether the defendant's statements were made voluntarily.

At his trial, the employee seeks to offer evidence that he had been drinking at the picnic and was highly intoxicated at the time of the altercation. In a jurisdiction that follows the common-law rules concerning admissibility of evidence of intoxication, the evidence of the employee's intoxication should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. admitted without limitation.\nB. admitted subject to an instruction that it pertains only to the attempted murder charge.\nC. admitted subject to an instruction that it pertains only to the assault charge.\nD. excluded altogether.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n At common law, intoxication can be the basis for a defense to a specific intent crime if the intoxication negated the requisite mens rea of the offense. In this case, the employee is charged with assault and attempted murder, both of which are specific intent crimes. Assault is an attempt to commit criminal battery, which requires that the employee intended to commit a criminal battery against his boss and took substantial steps toward the commission of the offense. Attempted murder requires proof that the employee had the intent to kill his boss and took substantial steps toward the commission of the offense. Both assault and attempted murder require that the employee have the intent to commit a further offense. If the employee was unable to form the intent to commit a battery or the intent to commit a murder due to his intoxication, he would have a valid defense to the charge. The evidence of the employee's intoxication should be admitted without limitation. Answer B can also be correct because the assault was actually brought to fruition by the commission of the battery. By stabbing his boss, the employee did not merely commit an assault; he committed criminal battery. The charge of assault would thus merge into the battery offense, and the evidence of the intoxication should be admitted only to the attempted murder charge.\n</s>"

One of these ricocheted off a stone column and struck and killed a customer in the bank. The man and woman were charged with murder of the customer. Which of the following is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The woman can be convicted of murder, because she did the act of killing, but the man cannot be convicted of either murder or manslaughter.\nB. Neither can be guilty of murder, but both can be convicted of manslaughter based upon an unintentional homicide.\nC. The woman can be convicted only of manslaughter, but the man cannot be convicted of murder or manslaughter.\nD. Both can be convicted of murder.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Murder is not a specific intent crime. However, malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied in actions that show gross recklessness toward human life. In this case, the woman, by arming herself with an automatic weapon and firing 15 rounds in a populated bank after the man ordered them to lie down, was acting with malice aforethought, and can be convicted of murder. The woman was acting with gross recklessness toward human life and thus with malice aforethought. The man is the woman's accomplice - a person who aids or encourages the principal to commit the illegal conduct. He is liable for the principal crime so long as he intended to aid or encourage the crime. In most jurisdictions, unless otherwise noted, all parties to a crime may be found guilty of the principal crime; in this case, murder. Thus, the man can also be convicted of murder.\n</s>"

The defendant is guilty of\nAnswer Choices:\nA. burglary, robbery, and murder.\nB. robbery and murder only.\nC. burglary and robbery only.\nD. robbery only.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Robbery is defined at common law as the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Burglary is the breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein. Felony murder is the killing of a human being in the course of a violent felony. In this case, the defendant is guilty of burglary, robbery, and murder. The defendant forced, at weapon point, the couple to allow him to enter their dwelling, which is sufficient for breaking and entering. When this breaking and entering occurred, the defendant had the intent to commit a theft of their property, and he is guilty of burglary. In addition, the defendant used force by tying and binding the couple, and the threat of force by threatening them, to take the necklace from the couple, and he had the intent to permanently deprive them of the necklace. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of robbery. Finally, the husband died as a result of the commission of those two violent felonies, so the defendant is guilty of felony murder. During the commission of the robbery and burglary, the defendant had the husband bound and gagged. That the husband would die from these actions, and the stress of attempting to escape, is foreseeable from the commission of the crime, and the defendant is guilty of murder.\n</s>"

The employee knew his boss was scheduled to go on a business trip on Monday morning. On Sunday morning, the employee went to the company parking garage and put a bomb in the company car that his boss usually drove. The bomb was wired to go off when the car engine started. The employee then left town. At 5 a.m. Monday, the employee, after driving all night, was overcome with remorse and had a change of heart. He called the security officer on duty at the company and told him about the bomb. The security officer said he would take care of the matter. An hour later, the officer put a note on the boss's desk telling her of the message. He then looked at the car but could not see any signs of a bomb. He printed a sign saying, \"DO NOT USE THIS CAR,\" put it on the windshield, and went to call the police. Before the police arrived, a company vice president got into the car and started the engine. The bomb went off, killing her.

Although the employee did not intend to kill the company vice president in particular, he is guilty of first degree murder.\n</s>"

The sheriff's department received an anonymous tip that a rival marijuana farmer had buried the marijuana farmer in a hillside about 200 yards from the rival's farmhouse. The sheriff's deputies went to the rival's farm. They cut the barbed wire that surrounded the hillside and entered, looking for the grave. They also searched the adjacent fields on the rival's farm that were within the area enclosed by the barbed wire and discovered clothing that belonged to the marijuana farmer hanging on a scarecrow. The rival observed their discovery and began shooting. The deputies returned fire. The rival dashed to his pickup truck to escape. Unable to start the truck, he fled across a field toward the barn. A deputy tackled him just as he entered the barn. As the rival attempted to get up, the deputy pinned his arms behind his back. Another deputy threatened, \"Tell us what you did with the marijuana farmer or we will shut you down and see your family on relief.\" The rival responded that he had killed the marijuana farmer in a fight but did not report the incident because he did not want authorities to enter his land and discover his marijuana crop.

Although the deputy's wording was not exactly a question, it was a statement that was meant to elicit a response from the rival, and it will be considered an \"interrogation\" for constitutional purposes.

On July 1, 1987, with regard to this incident, the defendant pleaded guilty to reckless driving (a misdemeanor) and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a fine of $1,000. She served the sentence and paid the fine. On April 1, 1988, the pedestrian died as a result of the injuries she suffered in the accident. On March 1, 1991, a grand jury indicted the defendant on a charge of manslaughter of the pedestrian. On May 15, 1991, trial had not begun and the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy in that her conviction of reckless driving arose out of the same incident, and on the ground that the three-year statute of limitations for manslaughter had run. The defendant's motion should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. granted only on double jeopardy grounds.\nB. granted only on statute of limitations grounds.\nC. granted on either double jeopardy grounds or statute of limitations grounds.\nD. denied on both grounds.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The charge of manslaughter has additional elements that reckless driving does not, namely the causing of the death of another; therefore, reckless driving is not a lesser included offense of manslaughter.

The death of the pedestrian, which occurred on April 1, 1988, was the final element of the offense of manslaughter to occur, and the state had 3 years from that date to charge the offense. Because the defendant was indicted on March 1, 1991, the state was within the statute of limitations in charging her with manslaughter, so the defendant's motion to dismiss on that ground should also be denied.\n</s>"

A defendant will be criminally responsible for the killing of another human being if the death occurred intentionally, recklessly or, possibly, negligently. In this case, the defendant, believing the gun was a prop and helping the victim rehearse a play, did not act with malice aforethought, did not act with recklessness, and did not act with gross negligence. If the jury believes her, the defendant should be found not guilty of murder or manslaughter.\n</s>"

But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happens to a snitch. He told no one about his plan.

They decided to stake out the apartment. The stakeout revealed that a significant number of people visited the apartment for short periods of time and then left. A man exited the apartment and started to walk briskly away. The officers grabbed the man and, when he struggled, wrestled him to the ground. They searched him and found a bag of heroin in one of his pockets. After discovering the heroin on the man, the police decided to enter the apartment. They knocked on the door, which was opened by the woman who lived there. The police asked if they could come inside, and the woman gave them permission to do so. Once inside, the officers observed several bags of heroin on the living room table. The woman is charged with possession of the heroin found on the living room table. She moves pretrial to suppress the heroin on the ground that it was obtained by virtue of an illegal search and seizure. Should the woman's motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the tip together with the heroin found in the man's pocket provided probable cause for the search.\nB. No, because the woman consented to the officers' entry.\nC.

Here, the facts do not indiciate that the police improperly obtained the woman's consent. The woman's consent justified the officers' entry. Once inside, the police properly seized the heroin because it was in plain view. Police may make a warrantless seizure when they are legitimately on the premises and discover evidence that is in plain view that they have probable cause to believe is evidence or a fruit or instrumentality of crime. Here, the woman's consent gave the police legitimate authority to be inside the building, they discovered the heroin on a living room table, and the criminal nature of the heroin was readily apparent.\n</s>"

One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the license number of the driver's car. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her and the car, and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat of the car. Later it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding. The driver was charged with unlawful possession of heroin. Her attorney filed a motion to suppress the use as evidence of the heroin found in the car. Should the motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the troopers could reasonably rely on the computer report and the search was incident to arrest.\nB. No, because troopers may lawfully search the passenger compartment of a car incident to a valid traffic stop.\nC.

In this case, the computer check on the license number of the driver's car revealed that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest based on unpaid parking tickets.

She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny it as to all photographs.\nB. Grant it as to all photographs, because the woman acted without probable cause.\nC. Grant it as to all photographs, because the woman violated the federal interception statute.\nD. Grant it only as to the second set of photographs.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A court will only grant a motion to suppress evidence based on a Fourth Amendment violation if the actor who obtained the evidence was a government agent. The woman's first entry of the computer and copying of the file constituted an entirely private search and did not trigger Fourth Amendment protections. The second set of photographs should be suppressed because authorities encouraged and offered to reward the second computer search. As such, the woman was acting as a government agent with regard to that search, which did in fact violate the Fourth Amendment because it was conducted without a warrant. See United States v. Jarrett, 338 F.3d 339, 344-48 (4th Cir. 2003) (describing relevant considerations, and finding on facts less compelling than these that private hacker was not government agent).

Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought, whereas manslaughter is a killing that would otherwise be murder but-for the existence of an adequate provocation for the killing.

Honestly believing that their actions were permitted by the U.S. Constitution, the police talked one of the employee's neighbors into going to the employee's home with a hidden tape recorder to engage him in a conversation about the crime. During the conversation, the employee admitted committing the robbery. The employee was charged in state court with the robbery. He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions. Assume that a clear precedent from the state supreme court holds that the conduct of the police in making the recording violated the employee's rights under the state constitution, and that the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for this violation. Should the court grant the employee's motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the employee's federal constitutional rights were not violated, and this circumstance overrides any state constitutional provisions.\nB. No, because the police were acting in the good-faith belief that their actions were permitted by the federal Constitution.\nC.

Nine successful bank robberies took place during the period of the charged conspiracy. Because the robbers wore masks and gloves and stole the bank surveillance tapes, no direct identification of the robbers by the witnesses has been made. Some circumstantial evidence ties each of the men to the overall conspiracy. During cross-examination, a prosecution witness testified that one defendant was in jail on other charges during six of the robberies. That defendant's lawyer has moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case. Should the motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a conspirator is not required to agree to all of the objects of the conspiracy.\nB. No, because a conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime conspired upon.\nC. Yes, provided the defendant has complied with the rule requiring pretrial notice of alibi.\nD. Yes, regardless of compliance with the alibi rule, because the government is bound by exculpatory evidence elicited during its case-in-chief.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n At common law, a conspiracy is defined as an agreement between two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful goal, or to accomplish some lawful goal by unlawful means. A co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. So long as there is an initial agreement among the conspirators to engage in a course of criminal conduct constituting all the crimes, there is only one conspiracy.\n</s>"

At his trial, the evidence established the following: A man and his wife were enjoying a drink at a tavern when the defendant entered and stood near the door. The wife whispered to her husband that the defendant was the man who had insulted her on the street the day before. The husband approached the defendant and said, \"Get out of here, or I'll break your nose.\" The defendant said, \"Don't come any closer, or I'll hurt you.\" When the husband raised his fists menacingly, the defendant pulled a can of pepper spray from his pocket, aimed it at the husband's face, and sprayed. The husband fell to the floor, writhing in pain. Should the defendant be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because he had no obligation to retreat before resorting to nondeadly force.\nB. No, because there is no obligation to retreat when one is in an occupied structure.\nC. Yes, because he failed to retreat even though there was an opportunity available.\nD. Yes, because the husband did not threaten to use deadly force against him.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The majority rule is that there is no duty to retreat prior to using deadly force. The non-aggressor may use deadly force in self-defense even if the use of deadly force could be avoided by retreating. However, the question states that the jurisdiction follows the \"retreat\" rule. In such a jurisdiction, a non-aggressor may use deadly force only after making a proper retreat. No retreat is necessary if it cannot be made in complete safety. Additionally, there is no obligation to retreat unless the defender intends to use deadly force. Here, the accused used pepper spray on the victim--a nondeadly force--and therefore there was no need to retreat.\n</s>"

He was not given Miranda warnings, but was immediately taken to a police station where he and five other men were placed in a lineup to be viewed by the bank teller. Each man was required to say the words spoken by the bank robber: \"Give me all your money. I've got a gun.\" After all the men in the lineup spoke those words, the teller identified the defendant as the robber. The defendant subsequently moved to suppress the testimony of the teller, claiming the lineup violated his privilege against self-incrimination. At a suppression hearing, the teller testified that she had not gotten a good look at the robber's face, because the robber had been wearing a hat pulled down over most of his face, but that she was certain the defendant was the robber because she had recognized his voice at the lineup. Should the defendant's motion be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because being required to speak at the lineup, while compelled, was not testimonial or communicative.\nB. No, because testimony of a witness based on firsthand observation is not subject to exclusion as the fruit of the poisonous tree.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was compelled to speak at the lineup, and this compelled speech led to the witnesss identification testimony.\nD. Yes, because the defendant was never informed that he could refuse to make a statement and that any statement could be used as evidence against him.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The defendant properly could be required to utter the words spoken by the bank robber. The privilege against self-incrimination extends only to compelled \"testimonial\" communications; \"[t]hus, even though the act may provide incriminating evidence, a criminal suspect may be compelled...to make a recording of his voice.\" United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 3435 (2000) (citing United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967)). Thus, Answer A is correct because the defendant did not provide a testimonial statement at the lineup.Answer B is incorrect. This explanation for why the defendant's suppression motion should be denied is overbroad and therefore incorrect because testimony based on firsthand observation may be suppressed in certain cases if the testimony derived from an unconstitutional identification procedure. See, e.g., Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977); United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967).\n</s>"

The officer did not find any of the stolen money but did see, lying open on the bed, the woman's diary. The diary contained an entry describing the woman's involvement in robbing the bank. The woman was charged in federal court with bank robbery. She moved to suppress the diary. Should the court suppress the diary?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the officer had no warrant.\nB. Yes, because admitting the diary would violate the woman's privilege against self-incrimination.\nC. No, because the hotel manager had actual authority to allow the officer into the hotel room.\nD.

Also, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to federal grand juries and is not a basis upon which a federal indictment can be dismissed. United States v.

Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun. The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to suppress its use as evidence. Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.\nB. Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.\nC.

Police saw a man wearing a white hooded sweatshirt and blue sweatpants pacing nervously outside one of the city's banks just before it closed. The police stopped the man and frisked the outer layers of his clothing for weapons, but found none. They asked the man what he was doing outside the bank and pointed out that he was wearing clothing similar to clothing worn by the perpetrator of recent robberies. After pausing for several moments, the man confessed. The police had not provided him with any Miranda warnings. After being charged with the bank robberies, the man moved to suppress his confession. The parties agreed, and the court properly found, that the police had reasonable suspicion but not probable cause at all times before the man confessed.

The diplomat became friendly with a woman in a bar who he believed was small enough to crawl through the air vent. Without telling her that he was a diplomat, he explained how she could get into the jewelry store. She agreed to help him burglarize the store. Someone overheard their conversation and reported it to the police. Shortly thereafter, the police arrested the diplomat and the woman. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. Before trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity. The court granted his motion. The woman then moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her. The jurisdiction has adopted the Model Penal Code version of conspiracy. Should the woman's motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her be granted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the diplomat's defense does not negate any element of the crime.\nB. No, because the woman was not aware of the diplomat's status.\nC. Yes, because a conspiracy requires two guilty participants.\nD.

In addition, many jurisdictions that require a bilateral conspiracy still allow conviction if one of the co-conspirators agreed to the crime but cannot be convicted based on lack of capacity or some other defense personal to the co-conspirator. Thus, Answer A is correct because the diplomat's defense will not negate the fact that the woman agreed to commit burglary.

Solicitation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. The victim must actually die as a result of the defendant's conduct, or else a murder did not occur. The woman cannot be guilty of murder, because the hitman did not in fact cause the neighbor's death. However, she can be convicted of attempted murder. An attempt is an act done with the intent to commit a crime where the act falls short of the full commission of the crime. Here, the woman hired a hitman to murder the neighbor, and all of the requisite acts for the commission of a murder occured except that the hitman did not cause the neighbor's death. Thus, the woman is guilty of attempted murder. Accordingly, neither conspiracy nor solicitation is the most serious crime of which she could be convicted.

The friend agreed but made the woman promise not to hurt anyone during the robbery. The woman then drove to a sporting goods store, where she explained to the store owner that she needed a small firearm for use in a bank robbery. The store owner responded that he would charge extra because the woman was so unwise as to confide her unlawful plans for using the weapon, and he sold her a handgun at four times the regular price. During the robbery, the woman used the gun to threaten a bank teller into handing over the money. The gun discharged by accident and killed a bank customer. At common law, who in addition to the woman could properly be convicted of murder in the death of the customer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the friend and the store owner.\nB. Neither the friend nor the store owner.\nC. Only the friend.\nD. Only the store owner.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The friend is responsible for the unintended but reasonably foreseeable acts of her co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy. When the friend agreed to drive the getaway vehicle after a bank robbery, it was foreseeable that the woman would use a weapon and end up killing someone during the robbery. The store owner's sale of the gun, combined with his knowledge of the woman's plan to use it in a crime and his financial benefit from that knowledge, should suffice to impose accomplice liability. Selling the gun at a higher price because of the woman's purpose is a high enough stake in the robbery to constitute intent to aid her. For those reasons, Answer B is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because the store owner could also be convicted of the murder. Answer D is incorrect because the friend could also be convicted of the murder.\n</s>"

When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man's conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because he was committing a felony.\nC. No, because the instruction wrongly described the necessary mental state.\nD. No, because it would violate double jeopardy to convict the man of two crimes for a single act.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The instruction was wrong. Intent to steal the car would not prove the man knowingly damaged the store. Nor would the fact that the man was in the process of committing another felony prove that the man knowingly damaged the store. To have acted knowingly, the man must have been practically certain that his conduct would damage the store. Thus, Answer C is correct, and Answers A and B are incorrect.\n</s>"

The executive went home, but she returned that night to retrieve personal items from her office. When she discovered that her key no longer opened a door to the building, she forced the door open and went to her former office. To avoid attracting attention, she did not turn on any lights. In the dark, she knew that she was taking some items that were not hers; she planned to sort these out later and return them. Upon arriving home, she found that she had taken a record book and some financial papers that belonged to the firm. After thinking it over and becoming angrier over being fired, she burned the book and papers in her fireplace. The jurisdiction has expanded the crime of burglary to include all buildings.

Neither larceny nor burglary.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The executive committed larceny, but not burglary. Here, the common law definition of burglary has been changed by statute to expand burglary to include all buildings. Thus, in this case, a burglary is the breaking and entering of a building of another at nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein. Under this definition, the executive did not commit burglary because she did not break and enter the building with the intent to commit a felony therein. The executive merely sought to recover her own personal possessions. Furthermore, the executive did not commit a burglary when she took the papers which did not belong to her because larceny is not a felony at common law.\n</s>"

When they passed through U.S. Customs inspection upon their return, the customs officials found liquid cocaine in several bottles each of them was carrying. They were arrested. Upon separate questioning by customs officers, the woman broke down and cried, \"I told my sister there were too many officers at this airport.\" The sister did not give a statement. The woman and her sister were indicted for conspiracy to import cocaine. They were tried separately. At the woman's trial, after the government introduced the above evidence and rested its case, her lawyer moved for a judgment of acquittal on grounds of insufficient evidence. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the evidence shows that both the woman and her sister agreed to import cocaine.\nB. No, because the evidence shows that both the woman and her sister possessed cocaine.\nC. Yes, because the evidence shows only that the woman and her sister committed separate crimes of cocaine possession.\nD. Yes, because the evidence shows that the woman effectively withdrew from the conspiracy when she cooperated by giving a statement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A conviction of conspiracy requires proof of an agreement to commit a crime and, in some jurisdictions or under some statutes, proof of an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. The conspiratorial agreement need not be proven through direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution is sufficient to allow a rational jury to find that there was a conspiratorial agreement beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, because a jury rationally could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt from all the circumstances (including the woman's statement about her discussion with her sister) that the woman and her sister had agreed to import cocaine, the issue is for the jury, and the woman is not entitled to a court-ordered acquittal.

The store owner examined the photograph and then asked the detective whether the police believed that the man pictured was the robber. After the detective said, \"We're pretty sure,\" the store owner stated that the man in the photograph was the one who had robbed her. The defendant was indicted for the robbery. His counsel moved to suppress any trial testimony by the store owner identifying the defendant as the robber. Should the court grant the motion and suppress the store owner's trial testimony identifying the defendant as the robber?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because suppression of in-court testimony is not a proper remedy, even though the out-of-court identification was improper.\nB. No, because the out-of-court identification was not improper.\nC. Yes, because the improper out-of-court identification has necessarily tainted any in-court identification.\nD. Yes, unless the prosecution demonstrates that the in-court identification is reliable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n An out-of-court identification procedure is improper if it is unnecessarily suggestive, which this procedure (involving just one photograph and the detective's leading statement) plainly was. Thus, Answer B is incorrect because the out-of-court identification was improper. An improper out-of-court identification procedure may require suppression of in-court testimony if it produces a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Thus, Answer A is incorrect because suppression of the out-of-court identification may be a proper remedy. However, even if an out-of-court identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive, which this one plainly was, suppression of in-court testimony is not required if the eyewitness's identification is shown to be reliable under a multi-factor inquiry. Answer C is incorrect because it may be possible to establish the reliability of the eyewitness's testimony without regard to the tainted out-of-court identification. Thus, Answer D is correct.\n</s>"

Under the facts of this case, a jury could properly convict the man of murder under that common law theory. While a jury could certainly convict the man of lesser manslaughter or assault crimes, murder is the most serious crime of which the man could properly be convicted. Answer B is incorrect. It is debatable whether the friend breaking the man's television could constitute adequate provocation to mitigate murder to voluntary manslaughter. Even assuming that it could, however, a jury could reject that mitigation here and instead convict the man of murder. Accordingly, voluntary manslaughter is not the most serious crime of which the man could properly be convicted.\n</s>"

The defendant has moved to quash the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Grant the motion, because the dismissal of the first charge on the merits, whether correct or incorrect, bars any further prosecution.\nB. Grant the motion, unless the prosecution has evidence that was not presented in the first case.\nC.

The police then informed him that he was under arrest and ordered him to get dressed. Charged with robbery, the man has moved to suppress the use of his statement as evidence.

An \"interrogation\" occurs when the policy use any words or engage in any conduct that they should know would likely elicit a response from the defendant.

Evidence that the defendant is addicted to this drug and has an overwhelming urge to consume it.\nB. Evidence that the defendant's coach, who gave him the drug, told him it was only an aspirin.\nC.

All other murder is second-degree murder, and manslaughter is defined as at common law. An employee was angry with her boss for denying her a raise. Intending to cause her boss discomfort, the employee secretly dropped into his coffee three over-the-counter laxative pills. The boss drank the coffee containing the pills. Although the pills would not have been dangerous to an ordinary person, because the boss was already taking other medication, he suffered a seizure and died. If the employee is charged with murder in the first degree, should she be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, only because she used poison.\nB. Yes, only because she acted with premeditation.\nC. Yes, both because she used poison and because she acted with premeditation.\nD. No.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n In this jurisdiction, the use of poison or acting with premeditation may elevate murder from second to first degree. However, murder requires that a killer have acted with malice aforethought, express or implied. Malice exists when a person intends to kill, intends to inflict great bodily harm, intends to commit an inherently dangerous felony, or acts with a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. The employee here did not intend to kill or cause serious injury to her boss when the employee dropped laxatives into her boss's coffee; the facts state that the employee only intended to cause her boss discomfort. Moreover, giving her boss laxatives that could be purchased over the counter does not rise to the level of reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. Therefore, because the employee did not intend to kill, did not intend to cause serious bodily injury, did not act with reckless indifference, and was not in the course of committing a felony, she would not be guilty of any degree of murder. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answers A, B, and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

An agent decided to enter the man's house while he was not at home and see what he could find. The agent discovered an envelope containing $5,000 in cash and an executive's business card. Returning the envelope to its place, the agent located and interviewed the executive, who admitted that he had paid the man $5,000 to settle a gambling debt; the executive also disclosed that the man regularly took illegal bets from the executive and several of his acquaintances. The agent then interviewed the acquaintances, who confirmed what the executive had told him. The agent then arranged to be introduced to the man at a local bar. After a few drinks, the man, unaware of the agent's identity, boasted that he was one of the biggest bookmakers in the state. The agent testified to all of his investigation's discoveries before a grand jury, which returned an indictment against the man for illegal gambling activities, based solely on the agent's testimony. The man's attorney then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it rested on violations of the man's constitutional rights. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because dismissal of the indictment is not the appropriate remedy.\nB. Yes, because much of the agent's testimony before the grand jury was inadmissible hearsay.\nC.

Using the bolt cutter, he cut the padlock on the shed and took the mower, which he then used to mow his girlfriend's lawn. She was surprised and pleased by this gesture.

The jury convicted the defendant and, following a separate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death. On appeal, the defendant's only argument was that excusing the prospective jurors violated his federal constitutional right to be tried by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of the community. How should the court of appeals rule on the conviction and the death sentence?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Affirm both.\nB. Affirm the conviction, but reverse the death sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing before a different jury.\nC. Affirm the conviction, but reverse the death sentence and remand for resentencing to life in prison.\nD. Reverse both.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A trial court properly may excuse a juror for cause from serving in both the guilt and penalty phases of a capital case if a juror's views regarding the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the juror from impartially deciding whether the death penalty is warranted in that particular case. Exclusion of such jurors does not violate the fair cross-section right of the Sixth Amendment. To establish such a violation, the defendant must show the underrepresentation of a distinct and numerically significant group in the venire to show his jury trial right was violated. Thus, Answer A is correct, and Answers B, C, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

The state introduced evidence that a man, identified by witnesses as the defendant, entered a convenience store at 11 p.m. on March 5, threatened the clerk with a gun, and took $75 from the cash register. The defendant did not testify, but his sister did. She testified that on March 5, at the time of the robbery, the defendant was with her in a city 300 miles away. On cross-examination, the sister admitted having given a statement to the police in which she had said that the defendant was not with her on March 5, but she claimed that the earlier statement was mistaken.  The court instructed the jury that in order to convict the defendant, they had to find all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. As to the defendant's claim of alibi, which of the following additional instructions would be proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Alibi is a matter of defense and so must be established by the defendant; however, the burden of persuasion is by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.\nB. Before you may consider the defendant's claim of alibi, you must decide whether he has produced sufficient evidence to raise the issue.\nC. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was present at the convenience store at about 11 p.m. on March 5, you must find him not guilty.\nD. If the defendant's evidence has caused you to have a reasonable doubt as to whether he was the robber, you must find him not guilty.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Due process requires the prosecution to prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Because an alibi is not a traditional defense but rather negates an essential element of the crime (the defendant's actual commission thereof), due process precludes imposing upon a defendant the burden of proving an alibi. Thus, Answer C is correct. Answers A and B are incorrect because they treat the alibi like a defense and put the burden of proof on the defendant. Answer D is incorrect because it refers to a resonable doubt arising from the defendant's evidence, rather than a reasonable doubt arising from the prosecution's lack of evidence to support a conviction.\n</s>"

A third state statute provides that a person acts recklessly if the person \"consciously disregards a substantial and unjustified risk that the material element exists or will result from the person's conduct.\"  The evidence at a criminal trial showed that the defendant robbed a 66-year-old man outside a senior citizens' center. The defendant testified truthfully that the robbery had occurred on a dark night, that she had had no idea how old the victim was and had not cared how old the victim was, and that she had intended to rob whomever she encountered.  Could the defendant properly be convicted of aggravated robbery of the elderly?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the only evidence on the issue showed that the defendant did not know, nor could she reasonably have known, the victim's age.\nB. No, because there was no evidence of a substantial risk that the victim was age 65 or older.\nC. Yes, because the evidence was clear that the victim was 66 years old, and the statute is designed to protect the elderly.\nD. Yes, because the jury could find that there was no justification for the defendant's conduct and that she was willing to take the risk that the victim was age 65 or older.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The mens rea or scienter standard for a conviction under the statute is recklessness, defined as disregard of a substantial and unjustified risk. Given the totality of the circumstances--including the crime's location, the victim's age, and the defendant's intent and unjustifiable actions--a jury could properly conclude that the defendant had acted with reckless disregard of the victim's age.

The passenger paid the attendant for the gas, and the driver drove off. The driver offered to reimburse the passenger for the gas, but the passenger declined. After discovering the missing cash, the gas station attendant called the police, and the driver was later stopped. The driver escaped with the stolen money, however, and was never prosecuted. If the passenger is prosecuted for theft as an accomplice, should he be convicted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because he had no intent to promote the commission of the offense.\nB. No, because the driver, the principal, was never prosecuted.\nC. Yes, because he facilitated commission of the offense by failing to make any effort to stop it.\nD.

Upon arriving at the house, the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious. An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine.  After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana. The young woman has filed a motion to suppress the use of both as evidence on the ground that the entry into the house and the searches were made without a warrant. How should the court decide the young woman's motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Grant it as to the cocaine, but deny it as to the marijuana.\nB.

Deny it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The police entry of the home was reasonable to provide aid to a man in need of emergency assistance. Once they were inside the home, the police officers could properly seize contraband in plain view but could not conduct an exploratory search for contraband. Accordingly, the police properly seized the cocaine (which was in plain view) but not the marijuana (which was the fruit of an improper, warrantless search). The court should deny the woman's motion to suppress the cocaine because it was lawfully seized under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. However, the court should grant the woman's motion to suppress the marijuana because it was unlawfully seized during an improper, warrantless search of her home. Thus, Answer B is correct, and Answers A, C, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

The homeowner told the man that he needed money. He promised to pay the man $500 if the man would go to the homeowner's house the following night and take some silverware. The homeowner explained to the man that, although the silverware was legally his, his wife would object to his selling it. The homeowner pointed out his home, one of a group of similar tract houses. He drew a floor plan of the house that showed the location of the silverware. The homeowner said that his wife usually took several sleeping pills before retiring, and that he would make sure that she took them the next night. He promised to leave a window unlocked. Everything went according to the plan except that the man, deceived by the similarity of the tract houses, went to the wrong house. He found a window unlocked, climbed in and found silver where the homeowner had indicated. He took the silver to the cocktail lounge where the payoff was to take place.

When one of the devices broke down and the speeder was arrested, he confessed that he often sped, secure in the knowledge that his \"SuperTrucker\" would warn him of police radar in the vicinity. Held: The defendant guilty as an accomplice to speeding. CASE B: The defendant told a man that the defendant had stored some stereo equipment in a self-storage locker. He gave the man a key and asked the man to pick up the equipment and deliver it to the defendant's house. The man complied, and removed the equipment from the locker, using the key. In fact, the equipment belonged to the defendant's neighbor, whose locker key the defendant had found in the driveway. Held: The defendant guilty as an accomplice to burglary. CASE C: A city council member accepted a bribe from the defendant in exchange for his vote on the defendant's application for a zoning variance. A statute prohibits the taking of bribes by public officials. Held: The defendant not guilty as an accomplice to the city council member's violation of the bribery statute. CASE D: The defendant, an innkeeper, sometimes let his rooms to prostitutes, whom he knew to be using the rooms to ply their trade. He charged the prostitutes the same price as other guests at his inn. Held: The defendant not guilty as an accomplice to prostitution. In this jurisdiction, conviction for statutory rape requires proof of the defendant's knowledge that the victim is underage. The defendant, who knew that a girl was underage, encouraged a friend, who was unaware of the girl's age, to have sex with her. The defendant has been charged as an accomplice to statutory rape.

At the center, one of the young children often arrived with bruises and welts on his back and legs. A statute in the jurisdiction requires all day-care workers to report to the police cases where there is probable cause to suspect child abuse and provides for immediate removal from the home of any suspected child abuse victims. The employee was not aware of this statute. Nevertheless, he did report the child's condition to his supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day-care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent. About two weeks after the the employee first noticed the child's condition, the child was beaten to death by his father. The employee has been charged with murder in the death of the child. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the child had been the victim of beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that the employee had seen. The child's mother had been aware of the beatings but had not stopped them because she was herself afraid of the child's father. The employee's best argument that he is NOT guilty of murder is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. he was not aware of the duty-to-report statute.\nB. he lacked the mental state necessary to the commission of the crime.\nC. his omission was not the proximate cause of death.\nD. the day-care corporation, rather than the employee, was guilty of the omission, which was sanctioned by its supervisory-level agent.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The employee will not bear criminal responsibility for the actions of another unless he intended that those actions be committed and he aided and abetted in the commission of the offense.

One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to the suspect's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to the suspect's house. The police knocked on the suspect's door and called out, \"Police. Open up. We have a search warrant.\" After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found the suspect with a large brown suitcase and put handcuffs on the suspect. A search of his person revealed a switchblade knife and a .45-caliber pistol. The suspect cursed the police and said, \"You never would have caught me with the stuff if it hadn't been for that lousy snitch Harvey!\" The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every room and closet. They found no one else, but one officer found an Uzi automatic weapon in a box on a closet shelf in the suspect's bedroom. In addition to charges relating to the cocaine in the suitcase, the suspect is charged with unlawful possession of weapons. The suspect moves pretrial to suppress the use as evidence of the weapons seized by the police and of the statement he made. As to the Uzi automatic weapon, the suspect's motion to suppress should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. granted, because the search exceeded the scope needed to find out if other persons were present.\nB. granted, because once the object of the warrant--the brown suitcase--had been found and seized, no further search of the house is permitted.\nC. denied, because the police were lawfully in the bedroom and the weapon was immediately identifiable as being subject to seizure.\nD. denied, because the police were lawfully in the house and had probable cause to believe that weapons were in the house.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Police officers are allowed to conduct a sweep of the residence that they are searching to protect themselves from others in the residence, even if the object of the warrant had already been found.

She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny it as to all photographs.\nB. Grant it as to all photographs, because the woman acted without probable cause.\nC. Grant it as to all photographs, because the woman violated the federal interception statute.\nD. Grant it only as to the second set of photographs.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A court will only grant a motion to suppress evidence based on a Fourth Amendment violation if the actor who obtained the evidence was a government agent. The woman's first entry of the computer and copying of the file constituted an entirely private search and did not trigger Fourth Amendment protections. The second set of photographs should be suppressed because authorities encouraged and offered to reward the second computer search. As such, the woman was acting as a government agent with regard to that search, which did in fact violate the Fourth Amendment because it was conducted without a warrant. See United States v. Jarrett, 338 F.3d 339, 344-48 (4th Cir. 2003) (describing relevant considerations, and finding on facts less compelling than these that private hacker was not government agent).

He took his revolver, went to a bar, and drank until he was very intoxicated.

Assume that a clear precedent from the state supreme court holds that the conduct of the police in making the recording violated the employee's rights under the state constitution, and that the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for this violation. Should the court grant the employee's motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the employee's federal constitutional rights were not violated, and this circumstance overrides any state constitutional provisions.\nB. No, because the police were acting in the good-faith belief that their actions were permitted by the federal Constitution.\nC. Yes, because the making of the recording violated the state constitution.\nD. Yes, because use of the recording would violate the neighbor's federal constitutional rights.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n A state may grant broader rights under its own constitution than are granted by the federal Constitution. Here, the state has a clear precedent that the recording violated the employee's state constitutional rights and that the recording should be excluded as a remedy. The court should apply this precedent to grant the employee's motion. Thus, answer C is correct, and answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because it is irrelevant what the police thought about the propriety of their actions under the federal Constitution where the state has granted broader rights under its own constitution, as permitted by Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983). Answer D is incorrect because the secret recording of a conversation with a defendant by a government informant, like the recording in this case, does not violate the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971).\n</s>"

When he got in and started the engine, the car began rolling down the hill. The man quickly discovered that the car's brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of a store at the bottom of the hill. The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property. The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued that the conviction for malicious damage of property should be reversed because the instruction was not a correct statement of the law. Should the man's conviction be affirmed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because his intent to steal the car provides the necessary mental element.\nB. Yes, because he was committing a felony.\nC. No, because the instruction wrongly described the necessary mental state.\nD. No, because it would violate double jeopardy to convict the man of two crimes for a single act.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The instruction was wrong. Intent to steal the car would not prove the man knowingly damaged the store. Nor would the fact that the man was in the process of committing another felony prove that the man knowingly damaged the store. To have acted knowingly, the man must have been practically certain that his conduct would damage the store. Thus, Answer C is correct, and Answers A and B are incorrect.\n</s>"

At the preliminary hearing, the presiding judge heard the testimony of four prosecution witnesses and found that the prosecution had failed to establish probable cause that the defendant had committed any offense. Accordingly, he dismissed the charge. The prosecutor then called the same four witnesses before a grand jury. The grand jury indicted the same defendant for attempted murder. The defendant has moved to quash the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy. How should the court proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Grant the motion, because the dismissal of the first charge on the merits, whether correct or incorrect, bars any further prosecution.\nB. Grant the motion, unless the prosecution has evidence that was not presented in the first case.\nC. Deny the motion, because the defendant has not yet been in jeopardy of conviction on the attempted murder charge.\nD. Deny the motion, because the protection of the double jeopardy clause does not come into play until there has been a conviction or an acquittal.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nCriminal_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n For double jeopardy purposes, jeopardy does not attach until trial, when the jury is sworn in (or, in a bench trial, when the first witness is sworn in). Thus, Answer C is correct. The dismissal after a preliminary hearing had no double jeopardy consequences because, as stated above, jeopardy only attaches when the jury is sworn in, or in a bench trial, the first witness is sworn in.

The stock clerk testified that the plaintiff fell near the cart but was not struck by it. Thirty minutes after the plaintiff's fall, the stock clerk, in accordance with regular practice at the department store, had filled out a printed form, \"Employee's Report of Accident,\" in which he stated that the plaintiff had been leaning over to spank her young child and in so doing had fallen near his cart.

The judge should rule the report offered by the department store\nAnswer Choices:\nA. admissible as res gestae.\nB. admissible as a business record.\nC. inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the stock clerk is available as a witness.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The stock clerk's written report is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff fell and was not hit by the cart. Thus, it is hearsay. The stock clerk's written report does not fall within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule and is inadmissible. Answer B is incorrect because the accident report is the type of business record that the department store keeps in the regular course of business, but quotes the stock clerk's own statement about the accident. A business record that quotes parties or witnesses is generally not within the exception because the person being quoted in the report is under no duty to accurately convey information about the incident. Answer D is incorrect because the stock clerk's availability as a witness is not the best choice for the rationale of the judge when ruling on the admissibility of the report.

The defendant believed that the witness was 600 miles away in a small town, engaged in the illegal sale of narcotics, on the day in question. On cross-examination by the defendant, the witness was asked whether she had in fact sold narcotics in the small town on that date. The witness refused to answer on the ground of self-incrimination.

On direct examination, to identify himself, the witness gave his name and address and testified that he had been employed by a roofing company for seven years.

Testimony from a former employer that the witness submitted a false expense report is extrinsic evidence that is being sought to be admitted to attack the witness's character for truthfulness and is thus inadmissible. Answer D is incorrect because a witness's bias or motive to lie can be shown through extrinsic evidence. The defendant's former cell mate's testimony that the witness asked for money in return for testimony favorable to the defendant would be admissible to show the witness's bias and motive to lie.\n</s>"

The police officer's defense was that, based on a description he heard over the police radio, he reasonably believed the plaintiff was an armed robber. A police radio dispatcher, reading from a note, had broadcast the description of an armed robber on which the police officer claims to have relied. The defendant offers the following items of evidence: I. The police officer's testimony relating the description he heard. II. 130 III. The note containing the description the police dispatcher testifies he read over the radio. Which of the following are admissible on the issue of what description the police officer heard?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. I and II only.\nB. I and III only.\nC. II and III only.\nD. I, II, and III.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The main issue at trial is to make a determination of what the police officer heard over the police radio. All three items of evidence the defendant is seeking to admit (the police officer's testimony, the police dispatcher's testimony, and the note) are relevant and admissible to that issue. The police officer can testify as to what he believed he heard. The police dispatcher can testify as to what he read over the radio. The note the police dispatcher read from is admissible to show what the police officer heard. They are all forms of relevant evidence to aid the fact finder in its determinations. None of these forms should be considered hearsay, because they are not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted - what the armed robber actually looked like - but rather to show their effect on the listener, the police officer. Additionally, the police dispatcher's testimony, since it is not a document, is not subject to exclusion under the best evidence rule. All three of these items of evidence are relevant, and there are no reasons for their exclusion from evidence.\n</s>"

In its case in chief, the prosecution offers evidence that the defendant had secretly obtained duplicate insurance from two companies on the property that burned and that the defendant had threatened to kill his ex-wife if she testified for the prosecution. The court should admit evidence of\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The defendant's obtaining duplicate insurance only.\nB. The defendant's threatening to kill his ex-wife only.\nC. Both the defendant's obtaining duplicate insurance and threatening to kill his ex-wife.\nD. Neither the defendant's obtaining duplicate insurance nor threatening to kill his ex-wife.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Evidence of other crimes or acts are not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. Such evidence may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. The fact that the defendant had obtained duplicate insurance of the burned property is relevant because it shows the defendant's motive for committing the arson. Any minor prejudicial effect of the evidence of duplicate insurance would be outweighed by the probative value of the evidence. The defendant's threat to kill his ex-wife if she testifies is also relevant, admissible evidence. The threat to kill his wife is being offered as proof of the defendant's plan and knowledge, and his consciousness of his guilt and his attempts to stop the introduction of evidence against him. Both the defendant's obtaining duplicate insurance and threatening to kill his ex-wife are admissible into evidence. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because both the duplicate insurance and the threat to kill his ex-wife are admissible.\n</s>"

Her son was the beneficiary. The author disappeared from her residence in the city of Metropolis two years ago and has not been seen since. On the day that Roberta disappeared, Sky Airlines Flight 22 left Metropolis for Rio de Janeiro and vanished; the plane's passenger list included a Roberta Rector. The son is now suing the insurance company for the proceeds of his mother's policy. At trial, the son offers to testify that his mother told him that she planned to write her next novel under the pen name of Roberta Rector. The son's testimony is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. admissible as circumstantial evidence that Roberta Monk was on the plane.\nB. admissible as a party admission, because Roberta Monk and her son are in privity with each other.\nC. inadmissible, because Roberta Monk has not been missing more than seven years.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The son's testimony concerning his mother's statement that she planned to write her next novel under the pen name of Roberta Rector is not hearsay and is admissible as circumstantial evidence that Roberta Monk was on the plane. Although it is an out-of-court statement, Roberta's statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that Ms. Monk planned to write her next novel using the pen name Roberta Rector. Instead, the statement is being offered to show that the person on the plane named Roberta Rector was, in fact, Roberta Monk. Since the statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it is admissible as relevant evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the statement is not an admission, and it is not from a party to the suit.\n</s>"

Answer C is incorrect because there is no burden shifting in cases involving judicial notice. Answer D is incorrect because, in civil cases, the court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.

They may, however, if probative of the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness. The witness's creation of a false affidavit is probative of his character for truthfulness and bears on his credibility. The plaintiff's counsel's questioning of the witness is proper. Answer A is incorrect because the question is admissible as to the witness's credibility and not to his standard for judgment of reputations. Answer C is incorrect because a witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness cannot be proven by extrinsic evidence of specific instances.

Because the dog is not a person, its reactions to the defendant's briefcase do not amount to a statement. Answer B is incorrect because the witness's testimony does not rely on hearsay; it is a description of what the dog did and what, in his expert opinion, that meant.

In his opening statement, the defendant's counsel asserted that his client had no key to the trunk and no knowledge of its contents. The prosecutor offers the state motor vehicle registration, shown to have been found in the glove compartment of the car, listing the defendant as the owner. The registration should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. admitted, as a statement against interest.\nB. admitted, as evidence of the defendant's close connection with the car and, therefore, knowledge of its contents.\nC. excluded, unless authenticated by testimony of or certification by a state official charged with custody of vehicle registration records.\nD. excluded, as hearsay not within any exception.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The state issued motor vehicle registration is admissible to show the vehicle was the defendant's and for the inference that he knew what was in the trunk. State issued motor vehicle registrations are self-authenticating documents that are admissible under the public records and records of regularly conducted business exceptions to the hearsay rule. Answer A is incorrect because the vehicle registration is not a statement made by the defendant; it is made by the state. In addition, it is not a statement against interest. Answer C is incorrect because the motor vehicle registration is self-authenticating.

Neither of them has any present memory of the number.

The guard was convicted of manslaughter for killing the plaintiff. At his criminal trial the guard, who was no longer working for the defendant, testified that the defendant's security director had instructed him to stop shoplifters \"at all costs.\" Because the guard's criminal conviction is on appeal, he refuses to testify at the civil trial. The plaintiff's estate then offers an authenticated transcript of the guard's criminal trial testimony concerning the instructions of the defendant's security director. This evidence is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. admissible as a statement of an agent of a party-opponent.\nB. admissible, because the instruction from the security director is not hearsay.\nC. admissible, although hearsay, as former testimony.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The defendant store was not a party to the prior criminal trial and its attorney was never afforded the opportunity to develop the guard's testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination. The defendant store, against whom the guard's testimony is sought to be admitted, was not a predecessor in interest to the prosecutor, and the prosecutor did not have the motive to cross examine the guard's testimony regarding the defendant store's involvement in the crime. For these reasons, the guard's testimony at his criminal trial does not meet the requirements of the prior testimony exception to the hearsay rule and is inadmissible. Answer C is incorrect because the defendant store was not able to develop the guard's prior testimony through cross examination.

This statement is thus hearsay and is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements for any exception to the hearsay rule. Answer A is incorrect because the hearsay statement is the deceased's statement to his wife. The defendant's statement to the deceased may be admissible to show the defendant's state of mind, but the deceased relaying that statement to his wife is another level of hearsay that has no exception and is thus inadmissible. Therefore answer B is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because the statement is inadmissible because it is hearsay, not because it is improper evidence of a prior bad act. The prior bad act of threatening the deceased, if not hearsay, would be admissible to show the defendant's motive. However, it is hearsay, and thus inadmissible.\n</s>"

At trial, the passenger calls a witness to testify that the witness had sold to the defendant a liability insurance policy on the plane. The testimony of the witness is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. inadmissible, because the policy itself is required under the original document rule.\nB. inadmissible, because of the rule against proof of insurance where insurance is not itself at issue.\nC. admissible to show that the defendant had little motivation to invest money in maintenance of the airplane.\nD. admissible as some evidence of the defendant's ownership of or responsibility for the airplane.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The witness's testimony that he had sold liability insurance on the plane to the defendant is admissible evidence to show the defendant's ownership or responsibility for the plane. Answer A is incorrect because the witness is not testifying to the content of the policy, only to its existence, and is not required to introduce the policy itself before he can testify. Answer B is incorrect because it misstates the standard for determining whether the witness's testimony is admissible. Answer C is incorrect because the existence of the policy is admissible and relevant to show the defendant's ownership or responsibility for the airplane, not his motivation to invest money in the airplane. It is the defendant's ownership of the plane that is at issue, and the witness's testimony is admissible as proof on that issue.\n</s>"

Because the court has the discretion to allow the questioning in that manner, allowing the questioning is not error. Answer B is incorrect because, although ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination, there is no requirement that the judge must allow the defendant's attorney to use leading questions on cross-examination of the defendant.

The evidence the prosecution is seeking to admit is being offered only to show the defendant's bad character and that he was acting in conformity therewith. The evidence should be excluded. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant has not testified. In addition, even if the defendant takes the stand, the evidence cannot be inquired into on cross examination because only specific incidents probative on the issue of truthfulness or untruthfulness, which these prior bad acts are not, can be asked of the witness. Answer C is incorrect because evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible character evidence when it is used in order to show action in conformity with those wrongs. Answer D is incorrect because although evidence may be admissible to prove identity, plan, or motive, none of the incidents the prosecution is seeking to introduce is relevant on any of those issues. There are no common elements, outside of their being instances of the defendant's bad character with a weapon, between the prior crimes and the current crime that would be relevant on the issue of identity, plan, or motive.

The plaintiff called an expert witness who based his testimony solely on his own professional experience but also asserted, when asked, that the book Smith on Milling Systems was a reliable treatise in the field and was consistent with his views.

On cross-examination, the defendant's lawyer asked whether the plaintiff claimed that he was exercising due care at the time, and the plaintiff replied that he was driving carefully. At a sidebar conference, the defendant's lawyer sought permission to ask the plaintiff about two prior intersection accidents in the last 12 months where he received traffic citations for failing to stop at stop signs. The plaintiff's lawyer objected. Should the court allow defense counsel to ask the plaintiff about the two prior incidents?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions does not bear on the plaintiff's veracity and does not contradict his testimony in this case.\nB. No, because there is no indication that failing to stop on the recent occasions led to convictions.\nC. Yes, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions bears on the plaintiff's credibility, since he claims to have stopped in this case.\nD. Yes, because improperly failing to stop on the recent occasions tends to contradict the plaintiff's claim that he was driving carefully at the time he collided with the defendant.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), a witness can be impeached with prior bad acts that bear upon truthfulness. B is incorrect because the incident's not leading to conviction is not the best reason to exclude this evidence; the best reason is that failing to stop at a stop sign has no bearing on truthfulness. As a general matter, a witness also can be impeached with evidence that contradicts a part of his testimony that bears on an important issue in dispute. However, in this case, the prior bad acts do not contradict the witness's testimony regarding his stopping on this particular occasion. Carelessness is a character trait, and evidence of a person's character is not admissible in a civil case to prove how that person acted on the occasion in question. Therefore, D is incorrect; a person can be acting carefully on one occasion and not another. So, the prior acts are not contradictory to the plaintiff's testimony that he was careful in this instance. If the plaintiff testified that he had never run a stop sign, then the prior acts would contradict his testimony.\n</s>"

If the defendant now seeks to impeach the credibility of the gang member, which of the following is the court most likely to admit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Evidence that the gang member had three misdemeanor convictions for assault.\nB. Testimony by a psychologist that persons with the gang member's background have a tendency to fabricate.\nC.

The state charges that the defendant switched a price tag from a cloth coat to a more expensive fur-trimmed coat and then presented the latter for purchase at the cash register. The defendant testified in her own behalf that the tag must have been switched by someone else. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks whether the defendant was convicted on two prior occasions of misdemeanor fraud in the defrauding of a retailer by the same means of switching the price tag on a fur-trimmed coat. Is the question about the convictions for the earlier crimes proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It is not proper either to impeach the defendant or to prove that the defendant committed the crime.\nB. It is proper both to prove that the defendant committed the crime and to impeach the defendant.\nC. It is proper to impeach the defendant, but not to prove that the defendant committed the crime.\nD. It is proper to prove the defendant committed the crime, but not to impeach the defendant.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), prior bad acts can be admitted to prove the defendant's conduct if offered for some purpose other than to show that the defendant is a bad person. In this case, the bad acts are very similar to the acts in dispute, and tend to show non-character purposes such as intent, knowledge, lack of accident, and modus operandi (i.e., that the defendant has a tendency to engage in particularized activity that sets her apart from others). Thus the bad acts can be offered as proof that the defendant committed the crime charged. In addition, Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(2) provides that evidence of a past conviction \"shall be admitted\" to impeach the credibility of a witness if the crime \"involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.\" In this case, fraud convictions clearly involve dishonesty, and are therefore properly admitted to impeach the defendant. Accordingly, the convictions are admissible both to prove that the defendant committed the crime and to impeach the defendant. Thus, Answer B is correct, and answers A, C, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

At trial, a witness testified for the defendant that she has a reputation in the community for complete honesty. After a sidebar conference at which the prosecutor gave the judge a record showing that the defendant's medical school had disciplined her for altering her transcript, the prosecutor proposes to ask the witness on cross-examination: \"Have you ever heard that the defendant falsified her medical school transcript?\" Is the prosecutor's question proper?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it calls for hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because its minimal relevance on the issue of income tax fraud is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nC. Yes, because an affirmative answer will be probative of the defendant's bad character for honesty and, therefore, her guilt.\nD. Yes, because an affirmative answer will impeach the witness's credibility.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The incident can be offered on cross-examination of the character witness, the proper purpose being to show that the witness's assessment of the defendant's character for honesty is not credible. The intent of the question is to test the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation on the one hand, and the quality of the community on the other. If the witness hasn't heard about the falsification, he might not be very plugged in to the community and so might be a poor reputation witness. On the other hand, if the witness answers \"yes,\" then the jury might infer that the community in which the defendant has a reputation for complete honesty may be setting the honesty bar pretty low. In either case, the alleged falsification is probative impeachment whether or not it occurred. Note that the courts require that the cross-examiner must have a good faith belief that the event actually occurred before inquiring into the act on cross-examination. In this case, that good faith standard is met by the evidence presented at the sidebar conference that the defendant was disciplined in medical school. The question does not call for a statement that would be used for its truth. Therefore, it is not hearsay. Likewise, the alleged incident is not offered to prove income tax fraud. Rather, the intent of the question is to test the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation on the one hand, and the quality of the community on the other. If the witness hasn't heard about the falsification, he might not be very plugged in to the community and so might be a poor reputation witness. On the other hand, if the witness answers \"yes,\" then the jury might infer that the community in which the defendant has a reputation for complete honesty may be setting the honesty bar pretty low.

In defense, the defendant called a witness to testify, \"I have been the plaintiff's neighbor for many years, and people in our community generally have said that he is a thief.\" Is the testimony concerning the plaintiff's reputation in the community admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because character is an essential element of the defense, and proof must be made by specific instances of conduct.\nB. Yes, to prove that the plaintiff is a thief, and to reduce or refute the damages claimed.\nC. Yes, to prove that the plaintiff is a thief, but not on the issue of damages.\nD. Yes, to reduce or refute the damages claimed, but not to prove that the plaintiff is a thief.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n In slander cases, where the defendant makes a statement that the plaintiff has an unsavory character, the plaintiff's character is considered \"in issue\" (i.e., an essential element of the claim or defense under the substantive law) in two respects. First, the plaintiff's actual character will determine whether the defendant was incorrect in his assessment, and thus liable for slander, because truth is a defense. Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched. If, however, the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character trait and to the extent of damages. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 405, when character is \"in issue\" it can be proved by evidence of reputation, opinion, or specific acts. Thus, answer B is correct, and answers A, C, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

At trial, the plaintiff's medical expert testified to the cause of the plaintiff's ulcer and stated that his opinion was based in part on information in a letter the plaintiff's personal physician had written to the plaintiff's employer, explaining why the plaintiff had missed work. When offered to prove the cause of the plaintiff's condition, is the letter from the plaintiff's doctor admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the plaintiff's physician is not shown to be unavailable.\nC. Yes, because it was relied upon by the plaintiff's medical expert.\nD. Yes, under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The doctor's letter is not a business record under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) because it was not prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity. In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case. There is no other exception that appears even close to being applicable (and none listed in the possible answers), so the letter is inadmissible hearsay. Answer C is incorrect. The letter is hearsay if offered to prove that the plaintiff's condition was as indicated in the letter. As explained above, Federal Rule of Evidence 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. Answer D is incorrect. The doctor's letter clearly does not qualify under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) as a business record. It is not a medical record prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity. Rather, it is a letter written by the doctor on an ad hoc occasion. Thus, the letter lacks the earmarks of regularity that are critical for admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.\n</s>"

Is the witness's testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the matter is governed by the presumption that neither spouse survived the other.\nB. No, because the witness's testimony is too speculative to support a finding.\nC. Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.\nD.

It is being offered to prove that the woman was alive at the time she made the statement and hence is relevant on the issue of whether she survived her husband, even if by only a few minutes.

To be relevant under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the evidence need only have \"any tendency to make the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Therefore, evidence that has only the slightest probative value can be admitted under this rule.

When the plaintiff's back and neck continued to be very sore after more than two weeks, his treating physician sent him to an orthopedist for an evaluation. Though the orthopedist did not treat the plaintiff, he diagnosed an acute cervical strain. At trial, the plaintiff called the orthopedist to testify that in response to the orthopedist's inquiry about how the plaintiff had injured his back, the plaintiff told him, \"I was standing near the top of a 15-foot ladder when I abruptly fell, landing hard on my back, after which the ladder toppled onto my neck.\" Should the statement be admitted?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the plaintiff is present and can be cross-examined about it.\nB. Yes, because it was made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\nC. No, because it was not made to a treating physician.\nD. No, because it relates to the inception or the cause of the injury rather than the plaintiff's physical condition.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The plaintiff's statement fits within Rule 803(4) of the Federal Rules of Evidence as a statement made for the purpose of medical diagnosis. This rule allows not only statements made to treating physicians, but also statements made to other doctors for evaluation or diagnosis. Here, the statement was made in response to a question by the treating orthopedist, and was made to explain how the plaintiff's injuries occured. Thus, Answer B is correct.\n</s>"

Is the tape recording admissible as evidence?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, under the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.\nB. Yes, under the public records exception to the hearsay rule.\nC. No, because it is hearsay and is a police report being offered against the defendant in a wrongful death case.\nD.

The plaintiff sought discovery of any accident report the employee might have made to the defendant, but the defendant responded that no such report existed. Before trial, the defendant moved to preclude the plaintiff from asking the defendant in the presence of the jury whether he destroyed such a report, because the defendant would then invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. Should the court allow the plaintiff to ask the defendant about the destruction of the report?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a report that was prepared in anticipation of litigation is not subject to discovery.\nB. No, because no inference may properly be drawn from invocation of a legitimate privilege.\nC.

The medical examiner testified that the knife blade was consistent with the victim's wound but admitted on cross-examination that any number of other knives could also have caused the wound. Should the judge grant a motion to strike the medical examiner's testimony?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the probative worth of this evidence is for the jury to assess.\nB. Yes, because in light of the medical examiner's admission, his testimony has insufficient probative value.\nC. Yes, because the medical examiner could not state the probability that the wound was caused by the defendant's knife.\nD. Yes, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n This evidence has some probative value because it links the knife in defendant's possession to the type of knife that could have caused the victim's wound. The evidence is not very strong, because other knives could also have caused the wound. But how much weight to give to the evidence is a decision for the jury. Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires only that evidence have \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Thus to be relevant, evidence need only have some probative value in establishing a fact. The Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 401 quotes the famous statement \"A brick is not a wall,\" making the point that evidence is admissible even if it is only a single brick that is a part of a large wall of evidence establishing a party's case.

Should the defendant's cross-examination of the manager be permitted over the plaintiff's objection?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.\nB. No, because the court has not declared the manager hostile.\nC. Yes, because the cross-examiner is entitled to explore matters relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.\nD.

Yes, because a bank teller is by occupation an expert on handwriting.\nB. Yes, because it is rationally based on the bank teller's perception and is helpful to the jury.\nC. No, because the bank teller was at fault in allowing loss of the original by failing to secure the check.\nD. No, because it is not possible for either the jury or an expert to compare the signature on the missing check with a signature established as genuine.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows lay opinion testimony when it is rationally based on the perception of the witness and is helpful to the jury. Here the teller knew the signature of the bank customer on whose account the check was drawn. This knowledge made it possible for her to recognize the signature on the check as a forgery. Her testimony that the signature was a forgery is testimony that the signature on the check presented was different from the signature of the owner of the account (a signature she knows). Obviously the owner of the account would be a stronger prosecution witness than the teller in establishing that the signature was forged, but this doesn't mean that the teller would not be allowed to testify.

The letters are hearsay if they are offered to prove the assertions contained in them--that there were dangers in using the microwave and that other persons had been injured. The letters are admissible only if they are offered for the limited purpose of proving that the manufacturer was put on notice of possible dangers in using the microwave. Such notice supports the claim of negligence, because it suggests that the manufacturer should have investigated and taken action to protect future consumers. Accordingly, the objection should be overruled because a limiting instruction will suffice to limit the use of the letters to the issue of notice.

At trial, she wishes to testify that prior to the accident she had never had any problems with her back. Is the plaintiff's proposed testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the plaintiff has not been qualified as an expert.\nB. No, because the plaintiff's pain could have been caused by factors arising after the accident, such as an injury at work.\nC.

The defendant denied negligence and denied that the plaintiff's injuries were severe. At trial, the plaintiff has offered in evidence a color photograph of himself made from a videotape taken by a television news crew at the scene of the collision. The plaintiff has demonstrated that the videotape has since been routinely reused by the television station and that the footage of the plaintiff was erased. The photograph shows the plaintiff moments after the collision, with his bloodied head protruding at a grotesque angle through the broken windshield of his car. Should the photograph be admitted over the defendant's objection?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the plaintiff has failed to establish that a duplicate could not be found.\nB. No, because the plaintiff has failed to produce the original videotape or a duplicate.\nC. Yes, because it tends to prove a controverted fact.\nD. Yes, because a photograph that establishes a disputed fact cannot be excluded as prejudicial.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Photographs are often useful evidence in establishing disputed facts. However, under FRE 403, the judge always has the right to exclude such evidence if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the photograph. In this case, the photograph is admissible. The defendant has denied that the plaintiff's injuries were severe. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to show the severity of his injuries by introducing the photograph. The evidence relates directly to the appropriate amount of damages and is not unfairly prejudicial. Thus, Answer C is correct, and Answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

The court may allow the examination if the report was used by the teller to refresh her memory before testifying, and must allow it if she used it during her testimony.\nB. The court must allow the examination, but only to the extent that the report contains the teller's own statement to the FBI agent.\nC.

Is the hospital record admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the nurse's testimony would be the best evidence of her actions in treating the plaintiff.\nC.

Rule it admissible only to impeach the bystander's credibility.\nB. Rule it admissible to impeach the bystander's credibility and to prove the amusement company's negligence.\nC.

At trial, the government seeks to have its agent testify to a conversation that he overheard between the defendant and a co-conspirator regarding the incoming shipment of a large quantity of cocaine. That conversation was also audiotaped, though critical portions of it are inaudible. The defendant objects to the testimony of the agent on the ground that it is not the best evidence of the conversation.  Is the testimony admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the testimony of the agent is not the best evidence of the conversation.\nB. No, because the testimony of the agent reports hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, because the best evidence rule does not require proof of the conversation through the audiotape.\nD. Yes, because the audiotape is partly inaudible.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Since the agent personally heard the conversation, he is not relying on the contents of the audiotape for his testimony. Therefore there is no violation of the best evidence rule. The agent is not attempting to prove the contents of the audiotape, only what he overheard. The conversation could, of course, also be proved by introducing the audiotape, and it can be argued that the audiotape is \"better\" evidence than the agent's testimony. Nonetheless, so long as the agent obtained his knowledge of the conversation from his own perception, and not by listening to the audiotape, the best evidence rule is not violated.

The trial will be extended and made cumbersome by hearing evidence of relatively trivial consequence.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nEvidence\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, or undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Only answer C does not deal with any of those considerations, and instead deals with the exclusion of evidence based on potential discovery violations. Answer A is incorrect because juror confusion of the issues is a consideration in determining whether to exclude relevant evidence. Answer B is incorrect because unfair prejudice on the part of the jury is also a consideration in determining whether to exclude relevant evidence. Answer D is incorrect because waste of time and needless presentation of trivial evidence is also a consideration in determining whether to exclude relevant evidence.\n</s>"

The defendant denied negligence and denied that the plaintiff's injuries were severe. At trial, the plaintiff has offered in evidence a color photograph of himself made from a videotape taken by a television news crew at the scene of the collision. The plaintiff has demonstrated that the videotape has since been routinely reused by the television station and that the footage of the plaintiff was erased. The photograph shows the plaintiff moments after the collision, with his bloodied head protruding at a grotesque angle through the broken windshield of his car.

Contracts for the sale of an interest in land fall within the statute of frauds as well. The promise that the creditor is seeking to enforce however is not part of a contract for the sale of an interest in land but rather a promise to repay a $25000 debt owed to the creditor by the seller.

The buyer and the seller entered into a final written agreement that was silent with respect to the verbal promise that the creditor seeks to enforce (the buyer's promise to repay the seller's debt). Because the writing was silent with respect to this in effect the creditor seeks to supplement rather than contradict the writing with extrinsic evidence of the promise.

Before he instituted his action against the buyer the creditor had not notified either the buyer or seller that he had accepted the buyer-seller arrangement for paying the creditor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise such as where the promisor knows that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary unless and until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he manifests assent to or materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise before receiving notice of the discharge. Since the promise at issue is the buyer's promise to pay $25000 \"to the creditor\" it appears that the creditor is an intended beneficiary since the performance flows directly to him. But if the buyer and seller later agreed not to pay any of the purchase price to the creditor this agreement would modify the March 1 agreement and if it were done before the creditor was aware of the existence of the agreement it would be effective in discharging the creditor's rights as intended beneficiary.\n</s>"

The buyer orally agreed to pay $25000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the seller in satisfaction of a debt which the seller said he had promised to pay the creditor. On March 10 the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement the secretary mistakenly typed $45000 rather than $46000 as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the creditor. If the buyer refused to pay more than $45000 for Homestead in an action by the seller against the buyer for an additional $1000 it would be to the seller's advantage to try to prove that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the writing was intended only as a sham.\nB. the writing was only a partial integration.\nC. there was a mistake in integration.\nD. there was a misunderstanding between the seller and the buyer concerning the purchase price.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of evidence of an agreement made prior to the adoption of a final writing if the prior agreement relates to matters within the scope of that writing. Where a clerical error has been made in reducing an agreement to writing however a party may bring an action in equitable reformation to have the writing reformed to correct the error or to include an omitted provision and the parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence to show the mistake that forms the basis for reformation. Therefore if the buyer and the seller verbally agreed that the buyer would pay $46000 in exchange for Homestead but the writing stated $45000 due to an error in transcription the seller may seek to have the writing reformed on grounds of mistake.\n</s>"

A purchaser became interested in purchasing a lot but could not decide between Lot 40 and Lot 41. The price and fair market value of each of those two lots was $5000. The purchaser paid the landowner $5000 which the landowner accepted and the landowner delivered to the purchaser a deed which was properly executed complete and ready for recording in every detail except that the space in the deed for the lot number was left blank. The landowner told the purchaser to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his decision and then to record the deed. The purchaser visited the development the next day and completely changed his mind selecting Lot 25. He filled in Lot 25 and duly recorded the deed. The price of Lot 25 and its fair market value was $7500. Before the landowner had time to learn of the purchaser's actions the purchaser sold Lot 25 to a neighbor for $6000 by a duly and properly executed delivered and recorded warranty deed. The neighbor knew that the landowner had put a price of $7500 on Lot 25 but he knew no other facts regarding the landowner-purchaser transaction. The neighbor's attorney accurately reported the purchaser's record title to be good marketable and free of encumbrances. Neither the neighbor nor his attorney made any further investigation outside the record. The landowner brought an appropriate action against the neighbor to recover title to Lot 25. If the landowner loses the most likely basis for the judgment is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the Statute of Frauds prevents the introduction of any evidence of the landowner's and the purchaser's agreement.\nB. recording of the deed from the landowner to the purchaser precludes any question of its genuineness.\nC. as between the landowner and a bona fide purchaser the landowner is estopped.\nD. the clean hands doctrine bars the landowner from relief.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n A bona fide purchaser for value is one who takes without notice before delivery of conveyance or payment of the purchase price and is protected as to reasonable expectations arising from the apparent ownership of his assignor. Although the neighbor knew of the $1500 price differential this was insufficient to put him on reasonable notice that he should inquire regarding the purchaser's ownership interest in Lot 25. Thus the landowner would be estopped from claiming superior title to the neighbor a bona fide purchaser.\n</s>"

C is incorrect. the father's promise does not fall within one of the categories of contracts required to be in writing. It could be performed in one year and it is not a suretyship agreement; the father thought he was liable not his son. D is incorrect. a promise is sufficiently definite if it provides a basis for determining breach and for giving a remedy.

I. The woman furnished no consideration either express or implied. II. The physician's contract was with the father and not with the woman. III. Whatever contract the physician may have had with the woman was discharged by novation on account of the agreement with the father.\nAnswer Choices:\nA. I only\nB. I and II only\nC.

As long as the consideration is bargained-for it is immaterial whether it was furnished by the promisee or by a third person. Therefore the physician's promise is enforceable despite the fact that the father furnished the consideration for the physician's promise to treat the woman (therefore statement I is incorrect). Although the woman was not a party to the father-physician contract she may enforce the contract as a third-party beneficiary if recognition of such a right in her is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties. This intention seems to be present since the physician's obligation (to \"take care of the woman\") flows directly to her (therefore statement II is incorrect).

A subsequent memo signed by both parties provided in its entirety: The department store will pay the computer programming company $20000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store\u2019s Zenon 747 computer; the computer programming company to complete by July 1 . This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6 the computer programming company demanded $10000 saying the job was one-half done. The parties orally agreed that the store should deposit $20000 in escrow pending completion to the satisfaction of the store\u2019s computer systems manager. On July 5 the programming company completed the programs. Tests showed that the computer programs not being perfectly coordinated with the store\u2019s billing methods cut processing time by only 47 percent. The department store\u2019s computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion requested that the escrow agent return the $20000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs. The department store denies liability on the ground that the programming company had orally agreed to coordinate with the department store\u2019s methods of accounting and the programming company seeks to bar introduction of that agreement based on the parol evidence rule. The department store\u2019s most effective argument is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence for the purpose of interpreting a written agreement.\nB. the memorandum was not a completely integrated agreement.\nC. the department store detrimentally relied on the oral promise of coordination in signing the memorandum.\nD. the memorandum was not a partially integrated agreement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e. one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to interpret an ambiguity in the writing. The department store seeks to introduce in litigation extrinsic evidence of a prior oral agreement by the computer programming company to coordinate its computer program with the department store\u2019s methods of accounting. Since the written memo between the parties is silent with respect to this issue the evidence should be admissible so long as the writing is found to be partially and not completely integrated. The fact that the writing is only two sentences long and does not contain a merger clause suggests that the memo was only partially integrated and therefore the department store should be successful in introducing the evidence.\n</s>"

The department store\u2019s obligation to pay $20000 is subject to an express condition since it agrees to pay only \"if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time.\" The department store is not obligated to pay any portion of the purchase price unless and until the condition is satisfied.

The department store\u2019s computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs. Assume that the computer programming company\u2019s delay in completion did not give the department store the right to renounce the contract and that the parties' escrow agreement was enforceable. Is the computer programming company entitled to recover damages for breach of the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the computer programming company had substantially performed.\nB. Yes because the program would save the department store $12000 a year.\nC. No because shortening the processing time by one-half was an express condition subsequent.\nD. No because the department store's computer systems manager did not certify satisfactory completion of the programs.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A breaching party can recover the reasonable value of a benefit conferred onto the non-breaching party in quasi-contract as long as the breach did not involve seriously wrongful or unconscionable conduct.

A subsequent memo signed by both parties provided in its entirety: The department store will pay the computer programming company $20000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store\u2019s Zenon 747 computer; the computer programming company to complete by July 1 . This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6 the computer programming company demanded $10000 saying the job was one-half done. After the department store denied liability the parties orally agreed that the department store should deposit $20000 in escrow pending completion to the satisfaction of the department store\u2019s computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5 the computer programming company completed the programs having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by the computer programming company and the department store\u2019s computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs not being perfectly coordinated with the department store\u2019s billing methods cut processing time by only 47 percent. They would however save the department store $12000 a year. Further if the department store would spend $5000 to change its invoice preparation methods as recommended by the computer programming company the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent saving the department store another $8000 a year. The department store\u2019s computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs. Assume that the computer programming company was in breach of contract because of its four-day delay in completion and that an express condition precedent to the department store\u2019s duty to pay the contract price has failed. Can the computer programming company nevertheless recover the reasonable value of its service?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because continued use of the programs by the department store would save at least $12000 a year.\nB. Yes because the department store was continuing to use programs created by the computer programming company for which as the department store knew the computer programming company expected to be paid.\nC. No because failure of an express condition precedent excused the department store from any duty to compensate the computer programming company.\nD. No because such a recovery by the computer programming company would be inconsistent with a claim by the department store against the computer programming company for breach of contract.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A breaching party can recover the reasonable value of a benefit conferred onto the non-breaching party in quasi-contract as long as the breach did not involve seriously wrongful or unconscionable conduct.

Applicable state law and college rules did not require either a statement of reasons or a hearing and in fact neither was offered to the assistant professor.

Except for the farm including the house and its furnishings the widower owned substantially no property. Under proper management the farm was capable of producing an adequate family income but the widower was unable to do farm work or even to provide for his own personal needs. The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower operated the farm and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed. The nephew who lived about fifty miles away where he was operating a small business of his own terminated his business and moved in with the widower. With the assistance of his wife the nephew gave the widower excellent care until the widower died intestate about five years after the date of the contract. In his final years the widower was confined to his bed and required much personal service of an intimate and arduous sort. The widower was survived by his only son who was also the widower's sole heir. The son resided in a distant city and gave his father no attention in his father's final years. The son showed up for the widower's funeral and demanded that the nephew vacate the farm immediately. Upon the nephew's refusal to do so the son brought an appropriate action for possession. The nephew answered by way of a counterclaim to establish the nephew's right to possession and title to the farm. If the court's decision is in favor of the nephew it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the land is located in a state where the Statute of Frauds will not be applied if there has been such part performance as will result in an irreparable hardship if the contract is not performed.\nB. the land is located in a state where the Statute of Frauds will not be applied if there has been such part performance that is by its very nature unequivocally referable to the contract.\nC. the son is precluded by the \"clean hands\" doctrine from enforcing his claim against the nephew.\nD. the blood relationship of uncle-nephew is sufficient to remove the necessity for any writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Part performance standing alone does not make a contract that is within the Statute of Frauds enforceable. Those jurisdictions adopting the approach in Restatement section 129 allow specific enforcement of a promise to convey land if the party seeking enforcement \"in reasonable reliance on the contract and on the continuing assent of the party against whom enforcement is sought has so changed his position that injustice can only be avoided by specific enforcement.\" The nephew's reliance and hardship are demonstrated by the following facts: The nephew terminated his business and moved fifty miles to care for the widower and fully performed by continuing to care for the widower for five years the final years of which required \"intimate and arduous care.\".\n</s>"

D is also incorrect. the salesperson's right to the commission is not dependent upon servicing the contract; rather it is dependent upon his employment status on the date that the customer is billed.\n</s>"

The manufacturer's sales people are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission the salesperson must be in the employment of the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer. In 2006 a salesperson for the manufacturer worked for eight months to get an order from a large corporation for a $750000 computer. He consulted extensively with the corporation's top executives and worked with its operating personnel to develop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised the corporation with the manufacturer's knowledge and approval to assist the corporation for six months after installation in making the equipment work. On January 1 2007 the corporation signed an order and on March 1 the computer was installed. On March 15 the manufacturer fired the salesperson on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 2005 and 2006 sales quotas. The salesperson thought that the manufacturer was correct in this statement. A coworker was thereupon assigned to service the corporation account. On March 31 the manufacturer billed the corporation for the computer. Which of the following additional facts if shown by the evidence would support a claim by the salesperson against the manufacturer? I. The manufacturer terminated the salesperson because the coworker is the son of the company's president who wanted his son to have the commission instead of the salesperson.  II. The manufacturer and the salesperson were mistaken; the salesperson had in fact exceeded his sales quotas for 2005 and 2006. III. The salesperson had worked for the manufacturer as a salesperson for 20 years.\nAnswer Choices:\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. I and II only\nD. I II and III.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n III is not relevant and could not be the basis of a claim against the manufacturer because either party can terminate the employment relationship at any time in an \"at-will\" employment contract. Furthermore although it may be a persuasive fact as to the salesperson's character as a good employee it would not significantly strengthen any claim against the manufacturer because under an \"at will\" contract even good employees can be fired at anytime for any reason as long as it is not against public policy.\n</s>"

The agreement also provided: I. The parties covenant not to assign this contract. II. Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company. The fabric company promptly made an \"assignment of the contract\" to a finance company as security for a $100000 loan. The new enterprise subsequently ordered took delivery of and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5000) for the new enterprise\u2019s requirement of the fabric for the first month of its operation. Which of the following accurately states the legal effect of the covenant not to assign the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The covenant made the assignment to the finance company ineffective.\nB. The covenant had no legal effect.\nC. The fabric company\u2019s assignment was a breach of its contract with the new enterprise but was nevertheless effective to transfer the fabric company\u2019s rights against the new enterprise to the finance company.\nD. By normal interpretation a covenant against assignment in a sale-of-goods agreement applies only to the buyer not the seller.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The fabric company breached the contract because it contained an express prohibition of assignment of rights. A prohibition against the assignment of a contract takes away the assignor's right to assign not the assignor's power to assign. If an assignment is made in breach of an express contractual provision the obligor (the business enterprise) has a right to damages for the breach but this right does not render the assignment ineffective unless the assignee (the finance company) knew of the prohibition. For this reason A is incorrect. Note: a prohibition against assignment is not the same as an invalidation of an assignment. In the latter situation if a contractual provision renders an assignment void the assignor has neither the right nor the power to assign the contract. B is incorrect. the covenant does allow the business enterprise to sue for damages for breach of the covenant. D is incorrect. covenants against assignment can apply to either the buyer or seller and the express terms of the agreement preclude both parties from assigning the contract.\n</s>"

The fabric company's rights under its agreement with the new business enterprise were personal and therefore nonassignable.\nB. The fabric company's \"assignment of the contract\" to the finance company to secure a loan would normally be interpreted as a delegation of the fabric company's duties under the contract as well as an assignment of its rights; and its duties owed to the new business enterprise were personal and therefore non-delegable.\nC. The original contract between the new business enterprise and the fabric company was unenforceable by either party for want of legally sufficient consideration for the fabric company's promise to supply the new business enterprise's requirements of the elasticized fabric.\nD. the new business enterprise ceased in good faith to have any further requirements for elasticized fabric.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A party's obligations under a requirements contract subject to the UCC 2-306 are measured by good faith.

The landowner entered into a written contract with a builder to build a house of stated specifications on Richacre and to sell the house and lot to the builder. The contract provided for an \"inside date\" of April 1 2007 and an \"outside date\" of May 1 2007 for completion of the house and delivery of a deed. Neither party tendered performance on the dates stated. On May 3 2007 the builder notified the landowner in writing of the builder's election to cancel the contract because of the landowner's failure to deliver title by May 1 . On May 12 the landowner notified the builder that some unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that the landowner was entitled to a reasonable time to complete. The notification also included a promise that the landowner would be ready to perform by May 29 and that he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date.

The farmer's barn is a standard red barn with a loft. The contract has no provision regarding assignment. If the painter assigns the contract to a contractor who has comparable experience and reputation which of the following statements is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The painter is in breach of contract.\nB. The farmer may refuse to accept performance by the contractor.\nC. The farmer is required to accept performance by the contractor.\nD. There is a novation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Unless the contract provides otherwise a contractual duty may be delegated to another unless the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Typically the other party will have such an interest where the contract is a personal services contract involving aesthetic taste and judgment. Although the painter-farmer contract is one for personal services (painting) the item to be painted is a standard barn and therefore the contract is not one involving aesthetic taste or judgment and the farmer should be indifferent about whether the work is done by the the painter or by the contractor. Therefore the painter's delegation of the duty was not a breach even if it was done without the consent of the farmer and if the farmer refuses performance by the contractor he will be in breach of contract. A and B are thus incorrect. D is incorrect. the mere delegation of a duty even if assented to by the obligee (the farmer) does not effect a novation; a novation would require an express agreement by the farmer to substitute the contractor for the painter.\n</s>"

The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15 and to complete all the work before June 1 . The total price of $10000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2500 on March 15; $2500 when the boathouse was completed; $5000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel.

In an action by the landowner against the builder for breach of contract which of the following can the builder successfully use as a defense? I.

Although the land contract provision of the statute has been broadly construed to include rights of way the neighbor-landowner agreement does not fall within the land contract provision because the neighbor's promise (\"permitting the digging\") was a gratuitous conveyance and not a contract for sale. Similarly a promise that cannot be performed within a year of its making falls within the one-year provision of the statute. Because the landowner-builder agreement was made on March 1 and the performance is to be completed by June 1 this agreement falls outside the one-year provision since it can be performed within a year of its making. Because neither agreement falls within the statute of frauds the fact that the agreements were not in writing is not a valid defense. Therefore A B and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

The father agreed to make payments of $2000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1 2001 upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001 when he also began building the house. The father made three $2000 payments for the work done in July August and September 2001 without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October but no work was done from November 1 2001 to the end of February 2002 because of bad weather and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1 2002 the contractor demanded payment of $2000 but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. What was the probable legal effect of the following? I. The contractor's failure to object to the father's making no payments on November 1 December 1 January 1 and February 1. II. The father's making payments in August through October without requiring a certificate from Builders. \nAnswer Choices:\nA. Estoppel-type waiver as to both I and II\nB. Waiver of delay in payment as to I and revocable waiver as to II\nC. Mutual rescission of the contract by I combined with II\nD. Discharge of the father's duty to make the four payments as to I and estoppel-type waiver as to II\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The condition in the contract fixing the time for payment was not a material part of the agreed exchange and therefore was subject to repeated waiver when the contractor failed to object as each of the four months passed without payment. By doing so he voluntarily abandoned this contractual condition for these months. The condition requiring a monthly certification prior to payment was waived by the father each time he made monthly payments without requiring certification. He was however permitted to revoke the waiver and reinstate the certification condition as to future payments if he allowed the contractor reasonable time to obtain the certificates and if the contractor had not detrimentally relied upon the waiver.\n</s>"

The contract contained the following provision: \"It is understood and agreed that the purchaser's obligation to pay the $1000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not within three months after the aforesaid exchange removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of said apartment house.\" Which of the following statements concerning the order of performances is LEAST accurate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The building owner's tendering of good title to the apartment house is a condition precedent to the purchaser's duty to convey good title to the farm.\nB.

The building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser and at the same time the purchaser must convey the farm to the building owner or no further duty arises on anyone's part. After the purchaser conveys the farm (but no more than three months after) the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment. So the building owner's conveyance of the apartment and the purchaser's tender of the farm are concurrent conditions and the building owner's removal of the shed is a condition precedent to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1000. Based on the contract language and order of performances cited in the question answer C is the least accurate statement concerning that order.\n</s>"

D can be eliminated immediately. Clearly the issue here is the determination of whether the obligation to remove the shed is a condition subsequent or condition precedent not whether it is a condition at all. Black's Law dictionary defines a condition precedent as \"an act or event other than the lapse of time that must exist or occur before a duty to perform something promised arises.\" The building owner's obligation to remove the shed within three months cannot be a condition precedent because it turns on the lapse of time. Therefore B can be eliminated. Black's Law defines a condition subsequent as \"a condition that if it occurs will bring something else to an end.\" In form the building owner's obligation to remove the shed within three months of the transfer of property was a condition subsequent to the exchange of the purchaser's farm for the building owner's apartment house. In substance however it was a condition precedent to the purchaser's obligation to pay the additional $1000 six months after the exchange. As a result C is clearly an incomplete response and can be eliminated. Thus A is the appropriate response and B C and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

In an action by the lender against the borrower on the promissory note which of the following if true would afford the borrower the best defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Although the lender honestly believed that $6000 was owed by the borrower the borrower knew that it was not owed.\nB. Although the lender knew that the debt was not owed the borrower honestly was in doubt whether it was owed.\nC.

Because the borrower may argue that the unilateral modification of the debt is unenforceable due to the preexisting duty rule the lender may argue that his promise to settle the claim provided sufficient consideration. The lender's argument will not succeed however if the lender knew that the claim was not valid.\n</s>"

The photographer was under a duty of immediate performance of his promise to deliver the cards as of December 15 by reason of the express language of the contract and despite the illness of the customer and the related developments.\nD. The customer's conduct after his illness constituted a waiver of the necessity of the photographer's performing on or before December 15.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Where the existence of a particular person is necessary for the performance of a duty his incapacity if sufficient to make performance impracticable may operate to excuse performance of the contract. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the contract between the customer and the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of \"[the customer] and his family\" the customer's availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer's duty and therefore his illness excused the photographer's delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the photographer had no way of knowing of the customer's recovery his obligation to resume performance was conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay beyond December was material thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation his conduct (informing the photographer to \"take the photograph anyway\") amounted to a waiver of the December 15 deadline. Answer C is the least accurate statement since as explained above the customer's illness provided a basis for excuse of the delay.\n</s>"

After the wife died the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: \"In consideration of [the man]'s saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will I hereby promise to pay [the man] $1000.\" Upon the husband's death the man filed a claim for $1000. The husband's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. In most states would the man's saving of the wife's life be regarded as sufficient consideration for the husband's promise?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the husband was thereby morally obligated to the man.\nB. Yes because the husband was thereby materially benefited.\nC. No because the husband had not asked the man to save her.\nD. No because the value of the man's act was too uncertain.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n In order to be enforceable a promise must be supported by bargained-for consideration. Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. Although the husband's promise states that it is given \"in consideration of the man's saving\" the wife's life in fact it is not sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise. The husband did not make the promise to pay $1000 in exchange for the man's act nor did the man save the wife's life in exchange for the husband's promise.\n</s>"

On March 1 the homeowner's property was inundated by flood waters which did not abate until March 15. The homeowner could not get the house in a condition which would permit the carpenter to begin the repairs until March 31. On that date the carpenter notified the homeowner that he would not repair the house. Which one of the following facts if it was the only one true and known to both parties on January 15 would best serve the carpenter as the basis for a defense in an action brought against him by the homeowner for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The carpenter's busy schedule permitted him to work on the homeowner's house only during the month of March.\nB. Any delay in making the repairs would not seriously affect the homeowner's use of the property.\nC. The cost of making repairs was increasing at the rate of 3 percent a month.\nD. The area around the homeowner's property was frequently flooded during the month of March.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A party's performance under a contract may be excused on grounds of supervening impracticability where the performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the flood was an act of God that related to a basic assumption of the agreement to repair the homeowner's house it operated to excuse any resulting delay in completing the requested work. Whether or not the delay was sufficiently severe to discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract depends on whether circumstances have so changed that performance will become materially more burdensome than the agreed-upon performance. The carpenter's busy schedule after March suggests that continued performance after the delay would be materially burdensome and thus his obligation should be completely discharged.\n</s>"

The engineer noticed that Chemco's most recent publicly issued financial statement listed as part of Chemco's assets a large inventory of a certain special chemical compound. This asset was listed at a cost of $100000 but the engineer knew that the ingredients of the compound were in short supply and that the current market value of the inventory was in excess of $1000000. There was no current public quotation of the price of Chemco stock. The book value of Chemco stock according to the statement was $5 a share; its actual value was $30 a share. Knowing these facts the engineer offered to purchase from a stockholder at $6 a share the 1000 shares of Chemco stock owned by the stockholder. The stockholder and the engineer had not previously met. The stockholder sold the stock to the engineer for $6 a share. If the stockholder asserts a claim based on misrepresentation against the engineer will the stockholder prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

There was no contract because silence could only operate as an acceptance in this case if the owner wished or intended to be bound by his silence. The plumber bears the risk of uncertainty in phrasing his offer in this manner; the purpose underlying this rule of law is to protect the offeree from imposition. Thus the owner's silence will operate as acceptance only if he intends for his silence to manifest acceptance. Because he is unaware of the plumber's performance there are no facts to support his intent to accept the offer made by the plumber on March 20.\n</s>"

The contract provided that the buyer would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give the seller funds to \"tool up\" for the work; that the seller would deliver 5000 brake linings on May 31; that the buyer would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that the seller would deliver the balance of the brake linings on June 30. On May 10 the seller notified the buyer that it was doubtful whether the seller could perform because of problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15 however the seller assured the buyer that the production difficulties had been overcome and the buyer paid the seller the first 50 percent installment of the purchase price.

When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the other party's performance the other may make a written demand for adequate assurances of performance and suspend return performance if commercially reasonable. Failure to respond to a justified demand for assurances is a repudiation of the contract. At the time of the buyer's receipt of the seller's notice on May 10 the seller had not repudiated the contract as the notice only expressed doubt over whether performance was possible. The notice did however provide reasonable grounds for the buyer to demand adequate assurances of performance and to suspend its return performance.\n</s>"

The non-repudiating party however may not recover damages that he might have mitigated with reasonable effort. The repudiating party is still free to retract its repudiation unless the non-repudiating party has relied on it or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final. The seller's June 10 statement that it would not perform the contract when read in light of its earlier communications and failure to make a delivery when due amounts to a repudiation that gives the buyer the right to bring immediate action for breach. Therefore each of A B and C are incorrect since each of the statements is accurate. D is the least accurate because as of June 10 in light of the seller's repudiation the buyer can immediately bring an action for breach and is not obligated to give the seller a commercially reasonable time for performance.\n</s>"

The loan was approved and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum written and supplied by the financing company and signed by the corporation's president for the corporation that read in its entirety: \"April 5 In consideration of a loan advanced on this date the corporation hereby promises to pay the financing company $100000 on September 1.

At the trial can the financing company prove the corporation's oral commitment to repay the loan on or before July 1?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the oral agreement was supported by an independent consideration.\nB. Yes because the evidence of the parties' negotiations is relevant to their contractual intent concerning maturity of the debt.\nC. No because such evidence is barred by the preexisting duty rule.\nD.

The oral commitment that the financing company seeks to introduce (that the loan would be repaid \"on or before July 1\") contradicts the final writing executed between the parties (stating that the corporation promises to repay the loan \"on September 1\"). Therefore it is barred by the parol evidence rule.\n</s>"

For a consideration of $5000 the landowner gave his neighbor a written option to purchase Broadacres for $300000. The option was assignable. For a consideration of $10000 the neighbor subsequently gave an option to his friend to purchase Broadacres for $325000. The friend exercised his option.  The neighbor thereupon exercised his option. The neighbor paid the agreed price of $300000 and took title to Broadacres by deed from the landowner. Thereafter the friend refused to consummate his purchase. The neighbor brought an appropriate action against the friend for specific performance or if that should be denied then for damages. The friend counterclaimed for return of the $10000. In this action the court will\nAnswer Choices:\nA. grant money damages only to the neighbor.\nB. grant specific performance to the neighbor.\nC. grant the neighbor only the right to retain the $10000.\nD. require the neighbor to refund the $10000 to the friend.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n An option promise is a promise not to revoke an offer to enter into a contract and it requires separate consideration to be enforceable. When a party exercises an option that party in effect accepts the offer and binds himself to the contract. The friend paid the neighbor $10000 in exchange for the neighbor's promise not to revoke his offer to sell. When the friend exercised the option he became obligated to purchase Broadacres for $325000 and his failure to consummate his purchase entitled the neighbor to pursue remedies for breach of contract. Specific performance generally will be awarded for breach of contract where an award of monetary damages would be inadequate or impracticable. Contracts involving the sale of land historically have been regarded as unique and therefore equitable relief traditionally has been allowed even where the breaching party is the buyer. Because the obligation that the neighbor seeks to enforce is the friend's obligation to purchase Broadacres (a contract to purchase land) specific performance will be awarded.\n</s>"

The contract provided that the financier-investor would invest $1000000 in the winery for its capital expansion and in return that the winery from grapes grown in it famous vineyards would produce and market at least 500000 bottles of wine each year for five years under a label with the financier's name on it. The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that if feasible the wine would be distributed by the winery only through a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper.

Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility. Soon after making its contract with the the financier-investor the winery without the the financier-investor's knowledge or assent sold its vineyards but not its winery to a large agricultural corporation. Under the terms of this sale the agricultural corporation agreed to sell to the winery all grapes grown on the land for five years. The agricultural corporation's employees have no experience in winegrape production and the agricultural corporation has no reputation in the wine industry as a grape producer or otherwise. The investor-winery contract was silent on the matter of the winery selling any or all of its business assets. If the financier-investor seeks an appropriate judicial remedy against the winery for entering into the winery-agricultural corporation transaction is the financier-investor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the winery-agricultural corporation transaction created a significant risk of diminishing the profits in which the financier-investor would share under his contract with the winery.\nB. Yes because the investor-winery contract did not contain a provision authorizing a delegation of the winery's duties.\nC. No because the winery remains in a position to perform under the investor-winery contract.\nD. No because the winery as a corporation must necessarily perform its contracts by delegating duties to individuals.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The financier-investor relied upon the fact that the winery was famous for its vineyards when the financier-investor entered into the five-year agreement with the winery.

UCC 2-508(1). For these reasons A is incorrect. B is incorrect. anticipatory repudiation consists of an indication by the seller through words or conduct that breach would occur when performance was due. The nonconforming shipment without notice was an attempted acceptance and simultaneous breach.

The passbook was issued solely in the stepson's name but the widow retained possession of it and the stepson was not then informed of the savings account. Subsequently the widow became disgusted with the stepson's behavior and decided to give the same savings account solely to her beloved adult daughter. As permitted by the rules of the bank the widow effected this change by agreement with the bank. This time she left possession of the passbook with the bank.

Yes because the stepson was a third-party intended beneficiary of the original widow-bank deposit agreement.\nB.

Before the lease was executed the landowner orally promised to have a five-acre parcel surveyed before the end of the lease term. The farmer took possession of the farm and paid for the rent for five years.

The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40000 upon the landowner's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further under a \"liquidated damages\" clause in the agreement the builder promised to pay the homeowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1. The homeowner however told the builder on January 2 before the contract was signed that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1. Because she was overextended on other construction jobs the builder did not complete the house until October 15. The landowner returned on November 1 as planned and occupied the house. Ten days later after making the $40000 final payment to the builder the landowner learned for the first time that the house had not been completed until October 15. If the landowner sues the builder for breach of contract on account of the fifteen-day delay in completion which of the following will the court probably decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The homeowner will recover damages as specified in the contract i.e. $500 multiplied by fifteen.\nB. The homeowner will recover his actual damages if any caused by the delay in completion.\nC. Having waived the delay by occupying the house and making the final payment the landowner will recover nothing.\nD.

The liquidated damages provision thus operates as a penalty and will not be enforced because it does not fix damages in light of anticipated or actual harm. Damages will thus be limited to any harm the landowner suffered in taking possession two weeks after the stated completion date. For this reason A is incorrect. C is incorrect. occupation and payment without knowledge of the delay cannot constitute a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a right.

It renounced the agreement and the pastry company sues for breach of contract. Which of the following will the court probably decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The baked goods retailer wins because mutuality of obligation was lacking in that the baked goods retailer made no express promise to buy any of the pastry company's baked buns.\nB. The baked goods retailer wins because the agreement was void for indefiniteness of quantity and total price for the year involved.\nC. The pastry company wins because the baked goods retailer's promise to sell at retail the pastry company's baked buns exclusively if it sold any such buns at all implied a promise to use its best efforts to sell the pastry company's one-year output of baked buns.\nD. The pastry company wins because under applicable law both parties to a sale-of-goods contract impliedly assume the risk of price and demand fluctuations.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Under the UCC a contract for exclusive dealing in a good imposes on the part of the seller an obligation to use best efforts to supply the good and an obligation on the part of the buyer to use its best efforts to promote the good's sale. Therefore the baked goods retailer was under an implied obligation to use its best efforts to promote the sale of the pastry company's buns for the duration of the contract.\n</s>"

The baked goods retailer promised not to sell any other supplier's baked buns. The parties' contract included a provision for termination by either party at any time upon reasonable notice. After six months of performance on both sides the pastry company claiming that its old bun-baker had become uneconomical and that it could not afford a new one dismantled the bun-baker and began using the space for making dog biscuits. The pastry company's output of baked buns having ceased the baked goods retailer sued for breach of contract. The baked goods retailer moves for summary judgment on liability and the pastry company moves for summary judgment of dismissal. Which of the following should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Summary judgment for the baked goods retailer because as a matter of law the pastry company could not discontinue production of baked buns merely because it was losing money on that product.\nB. Summary judgment for the pastry company because its cessation of baked-bun production and the baked goods retailer's awareness thereof amounted as a matter of law to valid notice of termination as permitted by the contract.\nC. Both motions denied because there are triable issues of fact as to whether the the pastry company gave reasonable notice of termination or whether its losses from continued production of baked buns were sufficiently substantial to justify cessation of production.\nD. Both motions denied because the pastry company may legally cease production of baked buns but under the circumstances it must share with the baked goods retailer its profits from the manufacture of dog biscuits until the end of the first year.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Under the UCC a quantity term in a contract that is measured by the output of the seller means such actual output as may occur in good faith. The pastry company is permitted under the contract to reduce its output of buns even to discontinue bun-making entirely but only if the reason for doing so was made in good faith rather than to avoid its obligation under the contract. Therefore there is a question of fact as to whether the pastry company's decision to discontinue bun-making was made in good faith. A B and D are incorrect. the question of whether the pastry company has breached the output contract involves an issue of material fact.\n</s>"

The manufacturer's price of the boat delivered to the retailer was $9500. As the contract provided the boater paid the retailer $4000 in advance and promised to pay the full balance upon delivery of the boat. The contract contained no provision for liquidated damages. Prior to the agreed delivery date the boater notified the retailer that he would be financially unable to conclude the purchase; the retailer thereupon resold the same boat that the boater had ordered to a third person for $12000. If the boater sues the retailer for restitution of the $4000 advance payment which of the following should the court decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The boater's claim should be denied because as the party in default he is deemed to have lost any right to restitution of a benefit conferred on the retailer.\nB. The boater's claim should be denied because but for his repudiation the retailer would have made a profit on two boat-sales instead of one.\nC. The boater's claim should be upheld in the amount of $4000 minus the amount of the retailer's lost profit under its contract with the boater.\nD.

Where an injured seller can demonstrate that breach by a buyer has caused it to lose profits due to a lower volume of sales the seller may recover the profit that the seller would have made from full performance. Because the retailer is a high-volume retailer the boater's breach likely caused it to lose profits due to lost volume. Therefore the boater may recover restitution of the $4000 downpayment less the profit that the retailer would have made on the sale.\n</s>"

Subsequently the well driller sent a developer an unsigned typewritten form captioned \"WELL DRILLING PROPOSAL\" and stating various terms the two had discussed but not agreed upon including a \"proposed price of $5000.\" The form concluded \"This proposal will not become a contract until signed by you [the developer] and then returned to and signed by me [the well driller].\" The developer signed the form and returned it to the well driller who neglected to sign it but promptly began drilling the well at the proposed site on the developer's project. After drilling for two days the well driller told the developer during one of the developer's daily visits that he would not finish unless the developer would agree to pay twice the price recited in the written proposal. The developer refused the well driller quit and the developer hired substitute to drill the well to completion for a price of $7500. In an action by the developer against the well driller for damages which of the following is the probable decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The developer wins because his signing of the well driller's form constituted an acceptance of an offer by the well driller.\nB. The developer wins because the well driller's commencement of performance constituted an acceptance by the well driller of an offer by the developer and an implied promise by the well driller to complete the well.\nC. The well driller wins because he never signed the proposal as required by its terms.\nD. The well driller wins because his commencement of performance merely prevented the developer from revoking his offer made on a form supplied by the well driller and did not obligate the well driller to complete the well.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n An offer is a manifestation of a willingness to bargain that creates a capacity in the offeree to form a contract by consent. Since the form that the well driller sent to the developer stated that the proposal would not be a contract until signed by both parties it is not an offer because it does not manifest an intent to conclude a contract upon mere signing by the developer. However after the developer signed the form the form became an offer that the well driller could accept either by signing the form or by manifesting assent in some other way (such as by commencing performance).\n</s>"

The owner agreed to pay $10000 for the work upon its completion. The owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement and had no ownership interest in the premises. Shortly before the agreement was signed the owner and landscape architect orally agreed that the writing would not become binding on either party unless the owner's spouse should approve the landscaping design. If the owner's spouse disapproves of the design and the owner refuses to allow the landscape architect to proceed with the work is evidence of the oral agreement admissible in the landscape architect's action against the owner for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the oral agreement required approval by a third party.\nB. Yes because the evidence shows that the writing was intended to take effect only if the approval occurred.\nC. No because the parol evidence rule bars evidence of a prior oral agreement even if the latter is consistent with the terms of a partial integration.\nD.

An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to prove the existence of a condition precedent to the written agreement.

The owner agreed to pay $10000 for the work upon its completion. The owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement and had no ownership interest in the premises. At the owner's insistence the written owner-architect agreement contained a provision that neither party would be bound unless the owner's law partner an avid student of landscaping should approve the landscape architect's design. Before the landscape architect commenced the work the owner's law partner in the presence of both the owner and the landscape architect expressly disapproved the landscaping design. Nevertheless the owner ordered the landscape architect to proceed with the work and the landscape architect reluctantly did so. When the landscape architect's performance was 40% complete the owner repudiated his duty if any to pay the contract price or any part thereof. If the landscape architect now sues the owner for damages for breach of contract which of the following concepts best supports the landscape architect's claim?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Substantial performance.\nB. Promissory estoppel.\nC. Irrevocable waiver of condition.\nD. Unjust enrichment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The nonoccurrence of an express condition will discharge the contractual obligation of a party who is subject to the condition unless the nonoccurrence of the condition has been waived by that party.

Therefore although the express condition to the owner-architect agreement did not occur (since the necessary approval was not given) the owner waived the condition when the owner ordered the work to proceed. Since the waiver occurred after the nonoccurrence of the condition and since the landscape architect relied on the waiver by completing 40% of the work the owner may not revoke the waiver.\n</s>"

The mother however had only enough income to pay one-half of the companion's $2000 monthly salary. Learning of their mother's plight the sister and brother agreed with each other in a signed writing that on the last day of January and each succeeding month during their mother's lifetime each would give their mother $500. Their mother then hired the companion. The siblings made the agreed payments in January February and March. In April however the brother refused to make any payment and notified his sister and their mother that he would make no further payments.

B is incorrect. the increased burden to the sister in and of itself would not be a sufficient reason for granting specific performance.

We can guarantee shipment no later than August 1.\" On June 10 the wholesaler sold and delivered the same rifles to another merchant for $300 each. Unaware of that transaction the retailer on the morning of June 11 mailed the wholesaler a letter rejecting the latter's offer but changing his mind an hour later retrieved from his local post office the letter of rejection and immediately dispatched to the wholesaler a letter of acceptance which the wholesaler received on June 14. On June 9 a valid federal statute making the interstate sale of assault rifles punishable as a crime had become effective but neither the retailer nor the wholesaler was aware until June 15 that the statute was already in effect. As between the retailer and the wholesaler which of the following is an accurate statement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No contract was formed because of wholesaler's June 10 sale of the rifles to another merchant revoked the offer to the retailer.\nB. If a contract was formed it is voidable because of mutual mistake.\nC. If a contract was formed it is unenforceable because of supervening impracticability.\nD. No contract was formed because the retailer's June 11 rejection was effective on dispatch.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A party's obligation under a contract may be discharged on grounds of mutual mistake if the mistake related to a basic assumption of the contract having a material effect on the exchange and if the party seeking discharge should not bear the risk of the mistake. Similarly a party's obligation under a contract may be discharged on grounds of supervening impracticability if the impracticability is due to an event the nonoccurrence of which is a basic assumption of the contract occurring without the fault of either party and where the party seeking discharge should not bear the risk of the event. Because the federal statute criminalizes the performance required under the contract (the interstate sale of assault rifles) it relates to a basic assumption of the contract and renders performance impracticable for both the retailer and the wholesaler.

No because such relief would undermine the policy of the statute of limitations against enforcement of stale claims.\nD. No because the man's April 1 promise was lawfully conditioned upon the friend's forbearing to sue prior to December 31.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Under the doctrine of constructive conditions a party's obligation under a contract is conditioned upon substantial performance of the other party's obligation under the same agreement. In other words a material breach of an obligation has the effect of discharging the other party's obligation. Therefore the man's obligation to pay the note in full was conditioned upon the friend refraining from bringing suit on the note. The friend breached that obligation on May 1 and therefore the man's obligation is no longer enforceable.\n</s>"

The daughter said to the family friend \"How about lending me $1000 to buy a used car? I'll pay you back with interest one year from today.\" The father added \"And if she doesn't pay it back as promised I will.\" The family friend thereupon wrote out and handed to the daughter his personal check payable to her for $1000 and the daughter subsequently used the funds to buy a used car. When the debt became due both the daughter and the father refused to repay it or any part of it. In an action by the family friend against the father to recover $1000 plus interest which of the following statements would summarize the father's best defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. He received no consideration for his conditional promise to the family friend.\nB. His conditional promise to the family friend was not to be performed in less than a year from the time it was made.\nC.

However the promise will not fall under the statute where the principal purpose of making the guarantee was to benefit the promisor himself. Therefore if the father's promise was made for the primary purpose of benefiting his daughter then his promise to guarantee his daughter's debt falls within the statute of frauds. Because the promise was made verbally there is no signed writing to satisfy the requirements of the statute. Answer A is incorrect. consideration was given to the daughter.\n</s>"

The lender replied that he would do so only if the borrower's father would guarantee the loan. At the borrower's request the father mailed a signed letter to the lender: \"If you lend $1000 to my daughter I will repay it if she doesn't.\" On September 15 the lender having read the father's letter lent $1000 to the borrower which the borrower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31.

Nothing because if he sues before the entire amount is due he will be splitting his cause of action.\nB. $300 plus the accrued interest because the borrower's breach is only a partial breach.\nC. $1000 plus the accrued interest because the borrower's unexcused failure to pay three installments is a material breach.\nD. $1000 plus the accrued interest because the failure to pay her debts as they come due indicates that the borrower is insolvent and the lender is thereby entitled to accelerate payment of the debt.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation an unequivocal statement of unwillingness or inability to perform a future contractual obligation if material may be treated as a total breach of that obligation and give rise to a right to immediately recover damages for that breach. A repudiation of a duty will not operate as a total breach however if it occurs after the repudiating party has received all of the agreed exchange for that duty. In such a case the non-repudiating party must wait until the obligation becomes due before enforcing it. Although the borrower failed to make three repayments of the debt and expressed her inability to repay the debt in the future the lender cannot accelerate the debt unless the contract specified otherwise. Therefore the lender can only recover for the three months of unpaid debt that is due and outstanding as of January 15.\n</s>"

In an action by the lender against the father's estate for $1000 plus accrued interest which of the following if any will serve as (an) effective defense(s) for the father's estate? I. There was no consideration to support the father's promise because he did not receive any benefit. II. The father died before the lender accepted his offer. III.

Thus the father's death on the 16th does nothing to render the promise made in his letter to the lender ineffective and II and III could not be a defense for the father's estate. Additionally lack of consideration is not a defense because there was valid consideration; the requirement of a benefit to the father as the promisor is broad enough to encompass his getting what he wants - namely that his daughter be given a loan.

The retailer seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned for various reasons 125 undefective radios for which the manufacturer had granted full credit. The manufacturer objects to the admissibility of this evidence. Assume the following facts. When the retailer returned the 25 radios in question it included with the shipment a check payable to the manufacturer for the balance admittedly due on all other merchandise sold and delivered to the retailer. The check was conspicuously marked \"Payment in full for all goods sold to the retailer to date.\" The manufacturer's credit manager reading this check notation and knowing that the retailer had also returned the 25 radios for full credit deposited the check without protest in the manufacturer's local bank account. The canceled check was returned to the retailer a week later. Which of the following defenses would best serve the retailer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The manufacturer's deposit of the check and its return to the retailer after payment estopped the manufacturer thereafter from asserting that the retailer owed any additional amount.\nB. By depositing the check without protest and with knowledge of its wording the manufacturer discharged any remaining duty to pay on the part of the retailer.\nC. By depositing the check without protest and with knowledge of its wording the manufacturer entered into a novation discharging any remaining duty to pay on the part of the retailer.\nD.

Although mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the accord consideration is furnished where the amount owed to the creditor is genuinely in dispute. Because there was a good faith dispute between the retailer and the manufacturer relating to the amount that the retailer owed the check that was sent to settle the dispute furnished sufficient consideration to support the manufacturer's implicit promise to discharge the debt.\n</s>"

Assume the following facts. If the painter had started to paint on the following Saturday morning he could have finished before Sunday evening. However he stayed home that Saturday morning to watch the final game of the World Series on TV and did not start to paint until Saturday afternoon. By late Saturday afternoon the painter realized that he had underestimated the time it would take to finish the work over the weekend unless he hired a helper. He also stated that to do so would require an additional charge of $200 for the work. The woman told the painter that she apparently had no choice but to pay \"whatever it takes\" to get the work done as scheduled. The painter hired a friend to help finish the painting and paid the friend $200. The woman has offered to pay the painter $1000. The painter is demanding $1200.  How much is the painter likely to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $1000 only because the woman received no consideration for her promise to pay the additional sum.\nB. $1000 only because the woman's promise to pay \"whatever it takes\" is too uncertain to be enforceable.\nC. $1200 in order to prevent the woman's unjust enrichment.\nD. $1200 because the impossibility of the painter's completing the work alone discharged the original contract and a new contract was formed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A unilateral modification of a contract (such as the woman's promise to pay an additional $200 for the same work) lacks consideration because of the preexisting duty rule. However some unilateral modifications may be enforceable notwithstanding the lack of additional consideration if the modification was done in good faith in light of circumstances that the parties did not anticipate at the time the contract was formed. Because the painter should have anticipated the circumstances that required his hiring an extra worker the modification is not enforceable and the woman is not bound by her promise to pay the extra $200. B is incorrect. the promise viewed in the context of the painter's demand was sufficiently definite. C is incorrect. unjust enrichment is not applicable where the benefit has been conferred pursuant to a binding contract. D is incorrect. the facts do not show that performance was impossible.\n</s>"

That night without the fault of either party the office building was destroyed by fire. Which of the following is an accurate statement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both parties' contractual duties are discharged and the painter can recover nothing from the owner.\nB. Both parties' contractual duties are discharged but the painter can recover in quasi-contract from the owner.\nC. Only the painter's contractual duty is discharged because the owner's performance (payment of the agreed price) is not impossible.\nD. Only the painter's contractual duty is discharged and the painter can recover his reliance damages from the owner.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n When the existence of a specific thing (such as the owner's office) is necessary for the performance of a contractual obligation the destruction of that thing is a supervening event that relates to a basic assumption of the contract; this effectively discharges any obligation of either party under that contract. However any benefit conferred under the contract prior to the supervening event may be recovered in restitution. Therefore the destruction of the owner's office discharged the painter's obligation to paint and the owner's obligation to pay for the work. Payment for the work that was already done however is nonetheless recoverable in restitution or quasi contract. Answer A is incorrect. the painter can recover in restitution.

On January 30 the farmer accepted a conveyance and possession of Greenacre and paid the $500000 purchase price but notified the landowner that he was reserving any rights he might have to damages caused by the landowner's breach. The farmer intended to use the land for raising cattle and had entered into a contract for the purchase of 500 head of cattle to be delivered to Greenacre on January 15. Because he did not have possession of Greenacre on that date he had to rent another pasture at a cost of $2000 to graze the cattle for 15 days. The landowner had no reason to know that the farmer intended to use Greenacre for raising cattle or that he was purchasing cattle to be grazed on Greenacre. In an action by the farmer against the landowner for damages the farmer is entitled to recover\nAnswer Choices:\nA. nothing because by paying the purchase price on January 30 he waived whatever cause of action he may have had.\nB. nominal damages only because the market value of the land exceeded the contract price.\nC. $2500 only (the fair rental value of Greenacre for 15 days).\nD. $2500 (the fair rental value of Greenacre for 15 days) plus $2000 (the cost of grazing the cattle elsewhere for 15 days).\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Where a partial breach of contract occurs the non-breaching party remains obligated to perform the contract but may recover damages for the partial breach. Consequential damages for breach of contract are limited to those that the breaching party had reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach at the time that the contract was made. When the landowner delivered possession of Greenacre 15 days after the time specified in the contract he committed a partial breach entitling the farmer to damages for the loss to him resulting from the delay. Because the landowner had no reason to know of the farmer's intended use of the land the landowner is not obligated to pay damages for the cost of renting another pasture. The landowner is however obligated to pay the fair rental value of Greenacre for the 15-day period of delay. Choice D is incorrect. the $2000 cost of renting another pasture was not reasonably foreseeable to the landowner and therefore not recoverable as consequential damages.\n</s>"

To fulfill that contract and without the collector's knowledge the broker contracted on January 1 to purchase for $10000 a specimen of that type of coin from a hoarder delivery and payment to occur on February 1. The market price of such coins had unexpectedly fallen to $8000 by February 1 when the hoarder tendered the coin and the broker repudiated. On February 25 the market in such coins suddenly reversed and had stabilized at $12000 on March 1. The broker however had failed to obtain a specimen of the coin and repudiated his agreement with the collector when she tendered the $12000 agreed price on March 1. Later that day after learning by chance of the broker's dealing with the collector the hoarder telephoned the collector and said: \"Listen the broker probably owes me at least $2000 in damages for refusing wrongfully to buy my coin for $10000 on February 1 when the market was down to $8000.

In excavating for the foundation and underground utilities the builder encountered a massive layer of granite at a depth of 15 feet. By reasonable safety criteria the building's foundation required a minimum excavation of 25 feet. When the contract was made neither the property owner nor the builder was aware of the subsurface granite for the presence of which neither party had hired a qualified expert to test. Claiming accurately that removal of enough granite to permit the construction as planned would cost him an additional $3 million and a probable net loss on the contract of $2 million the builder refused to proceed with the work unless the property owner would promise to pay an additional $2.5 million for the completed building. If the property owner refuses and sues the builder for breach of contract which of the following will the court probably decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The builder is excused under the modern doctrine of supervening impossibility which includes severe impracticability.\nB. The builder is excused because the contract is voidable on account of the parties' mutual mistake concerning an essential underlying fact.\nC.

However an offer may be irrevocable to the extent necessary to avoid injustice if the offeror should reasonably expect the offer to induce substantial reliance on the part of the offeree and where there is reliance in fact. The terms of the wallpaper hanger's offer suggest that the wallpaper hanger expected the general contractor to rely on his bid by utilizing it in calculating the general contractor's overall bid and the general contractor in fact did rely on his bid. The fact that the general contractor was required to submit a bid bond to guarantee her bid demonstrates the substantial nature of the general contractor's reliance because it shows the general contractor cannot pass the additional wallpapering cost on to the owner.

On April 27 Nirvana sent the widow a signed dated memo saying \"If we can arrive at the same price within the next week do we have a deal?\" The widow wrote \"Yes\" and her signature at the bottom of his memo and delivered it back to Nirvana on April 29. On May 1 the widow wrote Nirvana a signed letter offering to buy \"one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment for $180000 cash on delivery not later than June 1.\" By coincidence Nirvana wrote the widow a signed letter on May 1 offering to sell her \"one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment for $180000 cash on delivery not later than June 1.\" These letters crossed in the mail and were respectively received and read by the widow and Nirvana on May 2.  On May 4 the widow and Nirvana Motors both signed a single document evidencing a contract for the sale by Nirvana to the widow \"as a wedding gift for the widow's son\" a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan under the same terms as previously stated in their correspondence. On May 5 the widow handed the son a carbon copy of this document. In reliance on the prospective gift the son on May 20 sold his nearly new Cheetah (an expensive sports car) to a dealer at a \"bargain\" price of $50000 and immediately informed the widow and Nirvana that he had done so. On May 25 however the widow and Nirvana Motors by mutual agreement rescinded in a signed writing \"any and all agreements heretofore made between the undersigned parties for the sale-and-purchase of a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan.\" Later that day Nirvana sold for $190000 cash to another buyer the only new Mark XX Rolls-Royce that it had in stock or could readily obtain elsewhere. On June 1 the son tendered $180000 in cash to Nirvana Motors and demanded delivery to him \"within a reasonable time\" of new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment. Nirvana rejected the tender and denied any obligation. If the son sues Nirvana for breach of contract which of the following will the court probably decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The son wins because his rights as an assignee for value of the May 4 Widow-Nirvana contract cannot be cut off by agreement between the original parties.\nB. The son wins because his rights as a third-party intended beneficiary became vested by his prejudicial reliance in selling his Cheetah on May 20.\nC. Nirvana wins because the son if an intended beneficiary at all of the Widow-Nirvana contract was only a donee beneficiary.\nD.

The beneficiary's rights will vest if he materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise before receiving notice of the discharge.

Shortly after commencing work on the driveway which required for the specified level some excavation and removal of surface material the construction company unexpectedly encountered a large mass of solid rock. Upon encountering the rock formation the construction company instead of incurring additional costs to remove it built the access driveway over the rock with a steep grade down to the highway. The warehouse owner who was out of town for several days was unaware of this nonconformity until the driveway had been finished. As built it is too steep to be used safely by trucks or cars particularly in the wet or icy weather frequently occurring in the area. It would cost $30000 to tear out and rebuild the driveway at highway level. As built the warehouse including the driveway has a fair market value of $550000. The warehouse owner has paid $470000 to the construction company but refuses to pay more because of the nonconforming driveway which the construction company has refused to tear out and rebuild. If the construction company sues the warehouse owner for monetary relief what is the maximum amount that the construction company is entitled to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $30000 because the fair market value of the warehouse and driveway \"as is\" exceeds the contract price by $50000 (more than the cost of correcting the driveway).\nB. $30000 because the construction company substantially performed and the cost of correcting the driveway would involve economic waste.\nC. $30000 minus whatever amount the construction company saved by not building the driveway at the specified level.\nD. Nothing because the warehouse owner is entitled to damages for the cost of correcting the driveway.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The general damages rule for measuring loss to an owner for breach of a construction contract is that owner is entitled to damages in an amount equivalent to the cost to complete the work as promised. An exception to the rule is where cost to complete damages would be grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the performance contracted for in which case damages will be limited to the diminution in market value of the construction due to the defect. Although the fair market value of the warehouse and the defective driveway exceeds the contract price the warehouse owner nonetheless is entitled to the cost to complete damages because these damages fairly reflect his loss resulting from the defective construction. The warehouse owner therefore was justified in withholding $30000 from the contract price paid to the construction company.\n</s>"

If the court concludes that the tire salesman-county contract is a requirements contract then the fact that the county is buying some of its tires from a competitor would mean that the county has breached the requirements contract entitling the tire salesman to damages. A is incorrect. the contracts clause is not at issue. C is incorrect. the UCC rules regarding requirements contracts make clear that such agreements impose binding obligations on both the buyer and the seller. D is incorrect. although the quantity term in a requirements contract is flexible it is sufficiently definite for a court to enforce.\n</s>"

The retailer wrote to his daughter \"Give me your $3000 and I'll give you the car on our lot that we have been using as a demonstrator.\" The daughter thanked her father and paid him the $3000. As both the retailer and his daughter knew the demonstrator was reasonably worth $10000. After the daughter had paid the $3000 but before the car had been delivered to her one of retailer's sales staff sold and delivered the same car to a customer for $10000. Neither the salesperson nor the customer was aware of the transaction between the retailer and his daughter. Does the daughter after rejecting a tendered return of the $3000 by her father have an action against him for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the retailer's promise was supported by bargained-for consideration.\nB. Yes because retailer's promise was supported by the moral obligation a father owes his child as to the necessities of modern life.\nC.

Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise. The retailer's promise to give his daughter the car was supported by consideration because the promise was conditioned upon the daughter's promise to pay her father $3000. Answer B is incorrect. moral obligation does not suffice as consideration. Answer C is incorrect. courts at law do not inquire into the adequacy of considerations exchanged. Answer D is incorrect. the fact that the car was sold to a third party does not discharge the retailer's contractual obligation to sell the car to his daughter although the daughter may be limited to recovering monetary damages.\n</s>"

However where one party's performance requires a period of time (such as the builder's obligation to construct the garage) that performance is due before the other party is obligated to perform unless the contract specifies otherwise. Because the contract was silent with respect to progress payments the homeowner was not obligated to pay any portion of the contract price until the builder had substantially performed his promise to build the garage. The builder therefore was not justified in abandoning the job and his doing so after completing only 25% of the requested work was itself a material breach of the contract.\n</s>"

Nothing was said in the parties' negotiations or in the contract about progress payments during the course of the work. After completing 25% of the garage strictly according to the homeowner's specifications the builder assigned his rights under the contract to a bank as security for an $8000 loan. The bank immediately notified the homeowner of the assignment. The builder thereafter without legal excuse abandoned the job before it was half-complete. The builder subsequently defaulted on the loan from the bank. The builder has no assets. It will cost the homeowner at least $8000 to get the garage finished by another builder. If the bank sues the homeowner for $8000 which of the following will the court decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank wins because the builder-homeowner contract was in existence and the builder was not in breach when the bank gave the homeowner notice of the assignment.\nB. The bank wins because the bank as a secured creditor over the builder is entitled to priority over the homeowner's unsecured claim against the builder.\nC. The homeowner wins because his right to recoupment on account of the builder's breach is available against the bank as the builder's assignee.\nD. The homeowner wins because his claim against the builder arose prior to the builder's default on his loan from the bank.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n When contract rights are assigned the assignee acquires a right against the obligor only to the extent that the obligor is under a duty to the assignor. In other words the assignee acquires no greater rights against the obligor than the assignor had. When the builder (assignor) assigned his contract right to the bank (assignee) the bank's right to payment remained subject to any defense that the homeowner (obligor) could raise against the builder. Therefore the builder's material breach of the construction contract is a defense that the homeowner can raise against the bank.\n</s>"

Both parties are merchants with respect to widgets of all types. On June 2 the wholesale company mailed to the retailer its own form across the top of which the wholesale company's president had written \"We are pleased to accept your order.\" This form contained the same terms as the retailer's form except for an additional printed clause in the wholesale company's form that provided for a maximum liability of $100 for any breach of contract by the wholesale company. As of June 5 when the retailer received the wholesale company's acceptance form which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the legal relationship between the wholesale company and the retailer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. There is no contract because the liability-limitation clause in the wholesale company's form is a material alteration of the retailer's offer.\nB. There is no contract because the retailer did not consent to the liability-limitation clause in the wholesale company's form.\nC. There is an enforceable contract whose terms include the liability-limitation clause in the wholesale company's form because liquidation of damages is expressly authorized by the Uniform Commercial Code.\nD. There is an enforceable contract whose terms do not include the liability-limitation clause in the wholesale company's form.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Under the UCC a written acceptance generally will operate as such even if it states additional or different terms. The additional or different terms however will not become part of the contract if they materially alter the contract unless the offeror expressly agrees to such term. Although the wholesale company's form contained a limitation-on-liability clause the acceptance nonetheless operated as an acceptance of the retailer's offer. Since the contract price was $10000 the clause limiting wholesale company's liability to $100 proposes a material alteration to the contract and therefore will not become part of the contract since the retailer did not expressly agree to it. A and B are incorrect. the wholesale company's acceptance is effective notwithstanding the existence of a material additional term. C is incorrect. the liability-limitation clause proposes a material alteration and thus will not become part of the contract.\n</s>"

The developer promptly accepted the demolition bid and the old building was removed but the lender thereafter refused to make the loan. Despite diligent efforts the developer was unable to obtain a loan from any other source. Does the developer have a cause of action against the lender?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

Because the lender reviewed the plans for the project the lender should reasonably have expected that its promise to lend would induce the developer to accept the bid and to tear down her old building.

If she sues him for monetary relief what is the probable measure of her recovery?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Expectation damages measured by the difference between the value of the new building and the old building less the amount of the proposed loan ($100000).\nB. Expectation damages measured by the estimated profits from operating the proposed sporting goods store for ten years less the cost of repaying a $100000 loan at 10% interest over ten years.\nC. Reliance damages measured by the $10000 expense of removing the old building adjusted by the decrease or increase in the market value of the developer's land immediately thereafter.\nD. Nominal damages only because both expectation and reliance damages are speculative and there is no legal or equitable basis for awarding restitution.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n When a promise is enforceable on a detrimental reliance theory the remedy for breach of the promise may be limited as justice requires. A court may limit damages by awarding the injured party the amount necessary to remedy the loss incurred due to the reliance rather than awarding plaintiff's expectation damages (i.e. damages equivalent to the value of full performance). When the lender breached its promise to make the loan the developer was injured because she had already torn down the old building. The damages necessary to restore her to the status quo before the promise was made would include the cost of demolition plus any loss that the developer incurred from the depreciation of the property resulting from the demolition. A and B are incorrect. a court need not award full expectation damages in an action based on detrimental reliance.

The secretarial error in the written delivery-term was a mutual mistake concerning a basic fact and the agreement is voidable by either party.\nB. The man's not giving written notice by January 2 of his resale was a failure of a condition precedent to the existence of a contract.\nC.

The fact that the horse earned $400000 for the trainer soon after the sale (over 250 times the contract price) suggests that nondisclosure of the horse's true abilities related to a basic assumption of the contract relating to the horse's worth. If the son can establish that the trainer was aware that the horse was capable of running a race in record-setting time and that the son was ignorant of this fact then the son has a plausible argument for rescission on grounds of nondisclosure. A and C are incorrect. neither the son's ignorance of the horse's expertise nor the son's inexperience with evaluating horses alone would be sufficient to establish a basis for rescission.

The father paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by the woman as liquidated damages in the event the father canceled or failed to appear. At the time of contracting the woman told the father to be at the dock at 5 a.m. on May 15. The father and his family however did not show up on May 15 until noon. In the meantime the owner of the boat agreed at 10 a.m. to take a woman and her family out fishing for the rest of the day. The woman had happened to come by and inquire about the possibility of such an outing. In view of the late hour the owner of the boat charged the woman $400 and stayed out two hours beyond the customary return time. The father's failure to appear until noon was due to the fact that he had been trying to charter another boat across the bay at a lower rate and had gotten lost after he was unsuccessful in getting such a charter. Which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the rights of the parties?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The woman can retain the $200 paid by the father because it would be difficult for the woman to establish her actual damages and the sum appears to have been a reasonable forecast in light of anticipated loss of profit from the charter.\nB. The woman is entitled to retain only $50 (10% of the contract price) and must return $150 to the father.\nC. The woman must return $100 to the father in order to avoid her own unjust enrichment at the father's expense.\nD. The woman must return $100 to the father because the liquidated-damage clause under the circumstances would operate as a penalty.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A party in breach generally is entitled to restitution of any benefit that he has conferred in the way of part performance in excess of the loss resulting from the breach. Where the parties have agreed that the breaching party's performance is to be retained as liquidated damages the breaching party is not entitled to restitution if the liquidated damages clause is reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual damages resulting from the breach and the difficulty of proving damages. Although the father may argue that the woman was unjustly enriched to the extent that the deposit exceeded her actual loss the woman should be able to retain the $200 deposit. Damages representing the inconvenience to the woman resulting from the father's failure to appear are difficult to estimate and $200 was a reasonable estimate of the anticipated opportunity cost to the woman of not taking other potential customers.\n</s>"

The fee includes the use of the boat with the woman as the captain and one other crew member as well as fishing tackle and bait. On May 1 a father agreed with the woman that the father would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for himself and his family for $500. The father paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by the woman as liquidated damages in the event the father canceled or failed to appear. On May 15 at 1 a.m. the Coast Guard had issued offshore \"heavy weather\" warnings and prohibited all small vessels the size of the woman's from leaving the harbor. This prohibition remained in effect throughout the day. The father did not appear at all on May 15 because he had heard the weather warnings on his radio.  Which of the following is an accurate statement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The contract is discharged because of impossibility and the father is entitled to return of his deposit.\nB. The contract is discharged because of mutual mistake concerning an essential fact and the father is entitled to return of his deposit.\nC. The contract is not discharged because its performance was possible in view of the exceptional seaworthiness of the woman's boat and the father is not entitled to return of his deposit.\nD. The contract is not discharged and the father is not entitled to return of his deposit because the liquidated-damage clause in effect allocated the risk of bad weather to the father.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A contract may be rescinded on grounds of supervening impossibility where a party's performance is made impossible without his fault due to the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. Where a contract has been rescinded on grounds of supervening impossibility a party may obtain restitution of any benefit conferred by way of part performance of the contract. Because the Coast Guard prohibited vessels such as the woman's from leaving the harbor on the afternoon of May 15 as a consequence of bad weather performance of the woman-father contract was rendered impossible and the father should successfully obtain restitution of the $200 deposit.\n</s>"

Such event may include the destruction or deterioration of a specific thing necessary for the performance of a duty or the necessity to comply with a governmental order. Because the breeder undertook to exhibit his world champion animal(and not any other hog) the animal's availability for exhibition is a basic assumption of the contract. The animal's illness which requires him to be quarantined for a month under state law renders the breeder's performance impracticable.

The trailer company offered to install a spare tire on Monday when its service department would open but the general replied that he did not want the trailer and would purchase another one elsewhere. Which of the following is accurate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The general had a right to reject the trailer but the trailer company was entitled to a reasonable opportunity to cure the defect.\nB. The general had a right to reject the trailer and terminate the contract under the perfect tender rule.\nC.

The general was required to accept the trailer because the defect did not substantially impair its value.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Under the UCC's perfect tender rule when a delivery under a contract for the sale of goods fails to conform in any respect to the contract the buyer has the right to reject the delivery. The seller however must be given an opportunity to cure the defective delivery if the time for performance has not yet expired. When the trailer company presented to the general a trailer that was missing a spare tire the general was entitled to reject the trailer because of its nonconformity with the contract. The trailer company's offer to install a spare tire was a seasonable offer to cure the defect since the contract specified a June 1 delivery. B is incorrect. the buyer would not have the right to terminate if the seller seasonably cured the defect. C and D are incorrect. the perfect tender rule entitles the buyer to reject goods on the basis of material as well as immaterial defects.\n</s>"

The original flour wholesaler informed the baked goods producer of this transaction. Assume that when Miller tendered the first installment to the baked goods producer in compliance with the flour wholesaler-baked goods contract the baked goods producer refused to accept the goods. Which of the following arguments if any legally support(s) the baked goods producer's rejection of the goods? I. Executory requirements contracts are nonassignable. II.

In any event the flour wholesaler-Miller assignment will not have such an effect because the party assigning its contract is the seller. Because Miller is comparable to the flour wholesaler in terms of reputation and experience the baked goods producer should not have a particular interest in having the flour wholesaler perform the contract.

In an action by Miller against the baked goods producer for the contractual amount of the first installment which of the following if any will be an effective defense for the baked goods producer? I. The baked goods producer had not expressly agreed to accept Miller as her flour supplier. II.

The lawyer replied that her usual charge was $100 per hour and estimated that the legal work on behalf of the client would cost about $5000 at that rate. The client said \"Okay let's proceed with it\" and the lawyer timely and successfully completed the work. Because of unexpected title problems the lawyer reasonably spent 75 hours on the matter and shortly thereafter mailed the client a bill for $7500 with a letter itemizing the work performed and time spent. The client responded by a letter expressing his good-faith belief that the lawyer had agreed to a total fee of no more than $5000. The client enclosed a check in the amount of $5000 payable to the lawyer and conspicuously marked \"Payment in full for legal service in connection with the sale of the client's building.\" Despite reading the \"Payment in full. . .\" language the lawyer without any notation of protest or reservation of rights endorsed and deposited the check to her bank account. The check was duly paid by the client's bank. A few days later the lawyer unsuccessfully demanded payment from the client of the $2500 difference between the amount of her bill and the check and now sues the client for that difference. What if anything can the lawyer recover from the client?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Nothing because the risk of unexpected title problems in a real-property transaction is properly allocatable to the seller's attorney and thus to the lawyer in this case.\nB. Nothing because the amount of the lawyer's fee was disputed in good faith by the client and the lawyer impliedly agreed to an accord and satisfaction.\nC. $2500 because the client agreed to an hourly rate for as many hours as the work reasonably required and the sum of $5000 was merely an estimate.\nD. The reasonable value of the lawyer's services in excess of $5000 if any because there was no specific agreement on the total amount of the lawyer's fee.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Under rules of accord and satisfaction a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked \"payment in full.\" If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it and if the amount owed to the creditor is an unliquidated sum then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Although mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the accord consideration is furnished where the amount owed to the creditor is genuinely in dispute. Even if the client lacked sufficient legal basis to prevail on his claim his good-faith belief in the validity of the claim makes his promise to settle sufficient consideration to support the modification. Therefore when the lawyer read the \"payment in full\" language on the client's $5000 check and then cashed it without protest the lawyer accepted the accord and satisfaction of the debt. A C and D are incorrect. they fail to take into account the effect of the discharge of the client's debt through accord and satisfaction.\n</s>"

Because the contract involves a sale of goods (books) the modification is enforceable notwithstanding the lack of consideration. A is incorrect. the modification was gratuitous.

The distribution company promised in the contract to \"promote in good faith the sale of Fizzy Cola\" in that area; but the contract said nothing about restrictions on the products that the distribution company could distribute. Six months later the distribution company agreed with the Cool Cola Company to distribute its caffeine-free cola beverages in the same six-county area. If Fizzy Cola Company sues the distribution company for breach of their distribution contract which of the following facts if established would most strengthen Fizzy's case?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Cool Cola's national advertising campaign disparages the Fizzy Cola product by saying \"You don't need caffeine and neither does your cola.\"\nB. Since the distribution company began to distribute Cool Cola the sale of Fizzy Cola have dropped 3% in the six-county area.\nC. Prior to signing the contract with Fizzy Cola Company a representative of the distribution company said that the deal with Fizzy would be \"an exclusive.\"\nD.

The distribution contract between the distribution company and Fizzy required the distribution company to promote the sale of Fizzy Cola in good faith but did not specify whether the distribution company was restricted from distributing competing brands. Trade usage demonstrating that soft drink distributors uniformly handle only one brand of cola would strengthen Fizzy's argument because it is objective evidence that the agreement prohibits the distribution company from distributing competitors' brands of cola. A B and C are incorrect. each of these facts in and of itself is only inconclusive evidence that the distribution company may have breached its obligation to promote Fizzy Cola in good faith.\n</s>"

The writing provided in a clause separately signed by the computer whiz that \"No modifications shall be binding on the corporation unless made in writing and signed by the corporation's authorized representative.\" Because of family problems the computer whiz delivered and the corporation accepted only two game-designs a year for the first three years; but the games were a commercial success and the corporation made no objection. Accordingly the computer whiz spent substantial sums on new computer equipment that would aid in speeding up future design work. In the first quarter of the fourth year however the corporation terminated the contract on the ground that the computer whiz had breached the annual-quantity term. In the computer whiz's suit against the corporation for damages the jury found that the contract had been modified by conduct and the trial court awarded the computer whiz substantial compensatory damages. Is this result likely to be reversed on appeal?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the contract's no-oral-modification clause was not expressly waived by the corporation.\nB. Yes because the contract's no-oral-modification clause was a material part of the agreed exchange and could not be avoided without new consideration.\nC. No because the contract's no-oral-modification clause was unconscionable as against an amateur designer.\nD. No because the corporation by its conduct waived the annual-quantity term and the computer whiz materially changed his position in reasonable reliance on that waiver.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to a duty. Constructive conditions of exchange can be waived through conduct by treating a breach as only a partial breach and continuing to perform the contract. Although a waiver may be retractable in certain situations a waiver is not retractable once the non-waiving party has relied on the waiver. When the corporation accepted only two game-designs per year during the first three years of the contract the corporation implicitly waived the computer whiz's breach of the annual-quantity term of the contract. The computer whiz relied on this waiver when he spent substantial sums on equipment for future design work. Therefore it would be unjust to allow the corporation without prior notice to claim that the computer whiz breached the annual-quantity term in year four. A B and C are incorrect. a no-oral-modification clause does not preclude implicit waiver of a constructive condition.\n</s>"

This will introduce you to my good friend and former customer a hardware retailer who will be seeking to arrange the purchase of hardware inventory from you on credit. If you will let him have the goods I will make good any loss up to $25000 in the event of his /Signed/ manufacturer. The hardware retailer presented the letter to the hardware wholesaler who then sold and delivered $20000 worth of hardware to the hardware retailer on credit. The hardware wholesaler promptly notified the manufacturer of this sale. Which of the following is NOT an accurate statement concerning the arrangement between the manufacturer and the hardware wholesaler?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It was important to enforceability of the manufacturer's promise to the hardware wholesaler that it be embodied in a signed writing.\nB. By extending the credit to the hardware retailer the hardware wholesaler effectively accepted the manufacturer's offer for a unilateral contract.\nC. Although the manufacturer received no consideration from the hardware retailer the manufacturer's promise is enforceable by the hardware wholesaler.\nD.

In order for the acceptance to be effective however the offeree must give seasonable notice of acceptance to the promisor where the offeree has reason to know that the offeror will not learn of the acceptance without notice. The manufacturer's offer to the hardware wholesaler is an offer to enter a unilateral contract because the manufacturer does not seek a return commitment from the hardware wholesaler but rather for the wholesaler to provide credit to the hardware retailer. Because the hardware wholesaler lives far from the manufacturer however he has reason to know that the manufacturer will not learn of his acceptance unless he gives notice and therefore the hardware wholesaler must give notice of the extension of credit to the hardware retailer.\n</s>"

On February 2 the broker consummated sale of the complete set to the collector.  On October 1 the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid sustained rise; and on October 15 the hoarder wrote the broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment. The broker replied \"In view of the surprising market it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks.\" Having received the broker's message on October 17 the hoarder sued the broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by the broker in February.

The broker did not repudiate the contract on October 17 and may still perform no later than the contract deadline of December 31.\nB. Even if the broker repudiated on October 17 the hoarder's only action would be for specific performance because the coin is a unique chattel.\nC.

Failure to provide such assurance within a reasonable time may be treated as repudiation of the contract. Although the hoarder made a request for assurances of performance which the broker failed to provide the facts suggest that the hoarder's request for assurances was unreasonable. In order for a demand for assurances to be justified the insecurity must relate either to the inability or unwillingness of the other party to perform. A mere shift in market price for rare coins does not impugn the broker's willingness or ability to perform the contract. Nor does the broker's October 17 reply manifest a repudiation of the contract. In order to amount to a repudiation the communication must be an unequivocal statement of a party's inability or unwillingness to perform.\n</s>"

The broker replied \"In view of the surprising market it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks.\" After receiving the broker's message on October 17 the hoarder telephoned the broker who said \"I absolutely will not replace your coin until the market drops far below its present level.\" The hoarder then sued the broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by the broker in February. The trial began on December 1. If the broker moves to dismiss the hoarder's complaint which of the following is the hoarder's best argument in opposing the motion.\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The hoarder's implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in enforcement of the contract required her to mitigate her losses on the rising market by suing promptly as she did after becoming reasonably apprehensive of a prospective breach by the broker.\nB. Although the doctrine of anticipatory breach is not applicable under the prevailing view if at the time of repudiation the repudiatee owes the repudiator no remaining duty of performance the doctrine applies in this case because the hoarder the repudiatee remains potentially liable under an implied warranty that the coin advanced to the broker was genuine.\nC. When either party to a sale-of-goods contract repudiates with respect to a performance not yet due the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other the aggrieved party may in good faith resort to any appropriate remedy for breach.\nD.

A repudiation is an unequivocal statement of inability or unwillingness to perform. The broker's October 17 statement that he \u201cabsolutely will not\u201d replace the hoarder's coin until the market drops manifests such an intent; therefore the hoarder is entitled to treat his statement as a total breach of contract even though performance is not due until December 31.\n</s>"

On learning of the rejection does the glove manufacturer have a cause of action against the ski-shop operator for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the gloves were identified in the contract and tendered to the ski-shop operator.\nB. Yes because the glove manufacturer's faxed memo to the ski-shop operator was sufficient to make the agreement enforceable.\nC.

The contract between the ski-shop operator and the glove manufacturer falls within the UCC statute of frauds since it is for $600. However because the ski-shop operator and the glove manufacturer both appear to be merchants and becase the ski-shop operator failed to object to the writing within ten days of its receipt it appears that the glove manufacturer's faxed memo is a written confirmation that falls within the exception. A and D are incorrect. they are not relevant to the issue raised in the problem.

The collector who had insured the painting for $300000 with an insurance company promised to pay $25000 to a full-time investigator for the insurance company if he effected the return of the painting to her in good condition. By company rules the insurance company permits its investigators to accept and retain rewards from policyholders for the recovery of insured property. The investigator by long and skillful detective work recovered the picture and returned it undamaged to the collector. If the collector refuses to pay the investigator anything and he sues her for $25000 what is the probable result under the prevailing modern rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The collector wins because the investigator owed the insurance company a preexisting duty to recover the picture if possible.\nB. The collector wins because the insurance company the investigator's employer had a preexisting duty to return the recovered painting to the collector.\nC. The investigator wins because the collector will benefit more from return of the $400000 painting than from receiving the $300000 policy proceeds.\nD.

This can be done for example by reading into the promise an obligation to exercise discretion in good faith. So long as the promisor has limited her freedom of action in some way the court will find consideration sufficient to enforce the return promise. When the woman promised to pay $100 \"as soon as I am able\" she limited her freedom of action in that she will become obligated to pay the purchase price when it can be demonstrated that she has the ability to pay.\n</s>"

In the alternative the seller may recover the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time for tender. Where the market formula of damages is inadequate the seller may recover its lost profit on the sale (plus incidental damages) if the seller can demonstrate that it could have profitably made the extra sale had the contract gone forward (i.e. that it is a \"lost volume\" seller). When the customer repudiated the contract to buy the computer from the store the store resold the computer to a different buyer for the same contract price. Because the store did not give notice of resale to the customer it may not rely on the resale formula in calculating damages but this will have no effect on damages because the resale and the contract price are the same. But because the store can obtain more units than it can sell at retail this suggests that the store is a \"lost volume\" seller and therefore can recover the profit it expected to earn on the contract plus incidental damages.\n</s>"

No because the farmer has no duty under the contract to pay anything to the painter until all three barns have been painted.\nB.

The contract provided for Farmer's payment of $6000 upon Painter's completion of the work on all three barns. Painter did not ask for any payment when the first barn was completely painted but she demanded $4000 after painting the second barn. Assume that Farmer rightfully refused Painter's demand for payment. If Painter immediately terminates the contract without painting the third barn what is Painter entitled to recover from Farmer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Nothing because payment was expressly conditioned on completion of all three barns.\nB. Painter's expenditures plus anticipated \"profit\" in painting the first two barns up to a maximum recovery of $4000.\nC. The reasonable value of Painter's services in painting the two barns less Farmer's damages if any for Painter's failure to paint the third barn.\nD. The amount that the combined value of the two painted barns has been increased by Painter's work.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n A breaching party is entitled to recover in restitution for the reasonable value of the benefit conferred on the non-breaching party in the way of part performance less any damages that the non-breaching party suffered due to the breach. Since Painter terminated the contract without justification it is the breaching party. As a breaching plaintiff Painter is entitled to recover damages equivalent to the reasonable value of its services in painting the two barns minus any additional cost to Farmer (above what it would have paid under the contract) of having the third barn painted. A is incorrect. even if Painter's right to payment was expressly conditioned upon completion failure to satisfy the condition would not cut off Painter's right to recover in restitution. B is incorrect. a breaching party is not entitled to recover expectation damages (which would include lost profit). D is incorrect. it does not subtract from the restitution recovery any damages for the loss Farmer suffered due to the breach.\n</s>"

Yes because the retailer had not revoked its offer before April 15.\nB. Yes because a one-year option contract had been created by the retailer's offer.\nC. No because under applicable law the irrevocability of the retailer's offer was limited to a period of three months.\nD.

If the three-month period lapses and no consideration is given to support an option then the offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance (or before it lapses). Because the retailer's firm offer was not supported by consideration it became revocable as of March 15. However the lawyer accepted the offer before the retailer revoked it and before the offer lapsed (because the offer stated that it would be open for the entire year); therefore the retailer is bound to a contract to supply the paper.\n</s>"

Yes because the buyer's promise to buy bargained for and made in exchange for the shareholder's promise to sell was good consideration even though it was expressly conditioned on an event that was not certain to occur.\nB.

Such a promise is an illusory promise. However where a promisor's obligation is conditioned upon the occurrence of an event that is outside of the promisor's control the mere fact that the obligation is subject to a condition does not render the promise illusory. Because the buyer presumably does not control the actions of its parent company the fact that the buyer's obligation is conditioned upon the parent company's approval does not render it illusory since the buyer will be bound once the condition is satisfied and the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the condition is for the most part outside of the buyer's control.\n</s>"

The parent company's chief executive officer however is prepared to testify that the parent company would have routinely approved the contract if requested to do so. The buyer can also prove that he has made a substantial sale of other assets to finance the stock purchase although he admittedly had not anticipated any such necessity when he entered into the stock purchase agreement. If the buyer sues the shareholder for breach of contract is the buyer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the condition of the parent company's approval of the contract being designed to protect only the buyer and the parent company can be and has been waived by those entities.\nB. Yes because the buyer detrimentally relied on the shareholder's commitment by selling off other assets to finance the stock purchase.\nC. No because the express condition of the parent company's approval had not occurred prior to the lawsuit.\nD. No because obtaining the parent company's approval of the contract was an event within the buyer's control and the buyer's failure to obtain it was itself a material breach of contract.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The nonoccurrence of an express condition will discharge the contractual obligation of a party who is subject to the condition unless the nonoccurrence of the condition has been waived by that party. In other words the effect of nonoccurrence of the condition will depend on whose obligation is subject to it. The express condition in the buyer-shareholder contract relating to the parent company's approval (\"our commitment to buy is conditioned from the parent company\") affects the buyer's but not the shareholder's obligation. Since the facts suggest that both the buyer and the parent company are ready and willing to consummate the sale it appears that those parties waived the nonoccurrence of the condition.\n</s>"

An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to prove that the written agreement is to take effect only upon the occurrence of a stated condition (even if the condition is for only one party's benefit).

The building's large front window was smashed by vandals six months before expiration of the tenant-landlord lease. The tenant who was obligated thereunder to effect and pay for repairs in such cases promptly contracted with a window company to replace the window for $2000 due 30 days after satisfactory completion of work. The landlord was then unaware of the tenant-window company contract. The window company was aware that the building was under lease but dealt entirely with the tenant. Sixty days after the window company's satisfactory completion of the window replacement and prior to the expiration of the tenant's lease the tenant then insolvent ceased doing business and vacated the building. In so doing the tenant forfeited under the lease provisions its right to the return of a $2000 security deposit with the landlord. The deposit had been required however for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the leased property except ordinary wear and tear. The only such damage occurring during the tenant's occupancy was the smashed window. The window company's $2000 bill for the window replacement is wholly unpaid. Assuming that the window company has no remedy quasi in rem under the relevant state mechanic's lien statute which of the following would provide the window company's best chance of an effective remedy in personam against the landlord?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. An action in quasi contract for the reasonable value of a benefit unofficiously and non-gratuitously conferred on the landlord.\nB. An action based on promissory estoppel.\nC. An action based on an implied-in-fact contract.\nD. An action as third-party intended beneficiary of the tenant-landlord lease.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Generally a party that has made a contract with another cannot later disregard the contract and bring suit in restitution against a third person even if that third person has received a benefit from the contract. For example where the window company has conferred a benefit (replaced the glass in the window) pursuant to its contract with the tenant it normally would not be able to recover in restitution from the landlord. However sometimes recovery in restitution is possible especially where the third person (the landlord) has not already paid someone else for the work and the claimant's (the window company's) avenues to bring suit to enforce the contract have been exhausted. These and other factors suggest that restitution against the landlord would be just in this case: the tenant is insolvent the landlord collected on a $2000 deposit that the tenant forfeited because of the broken window and the fact that the lease expressly contemplated the tenant fixing any damage to the property suggests that the landlord would have requested the work if given the opportunity.\n</s>"

The only such damage occuring during the tenant's occupancy was the smashed window. The window company's $2000 bill for the window replacement is wholly unpaid. Upon vacating the building the tenant mailed a $1000 check to the window company bearing on its face the following conspicuous notation: \"This check is in full and final satisfaction of your $2000 window replacement bill.\" Without noticing this notation the window company cashed the check and now sues the tenant for the $1000 difference. If the tenant's only defense is accord and satisfaction is the tenant likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the window company failed to notice the tenant's notation on the check.\nB. No because the amount owed by the tenant to the window company was liquidated and undisputed.\nC. Yes because by cashing the check the window company impliedly agreed to accept the $1000 as full payment of its claim.\nD.

Mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the modification however unless the amount owed to the creditor is not liquidated (i.e. genuinely in dispute). Although the tenant made an offer for an accord in satisfaction that the window company accepted when it cashed the check it was not enforceable because it lacked consideration - the amount of and basis for the debt which the tenant owed to the window company was not in dispute.C and D are incorrect. an accord and satisfaction is not enforceable unless the debt is genuinely in dispute (in any event cashing a check with a reservation-of-rights notation most likely would not help the window company).\n</s>"

The additional or different terms however will not become part of the contract if they materially alter the contract unless the offeror expressly agrees to such term. The potential buyer's June 5th letter operated as an acceptance of the vendor's offer but proposed a later payment date. Because the vendor expressly rejected this proposed term it did not form part of the contract. Therefore the potential buyer's June 9th communication operated as a repudiation of an existing agreement to buy 100 QT's.\n</s>"

The only response was an offer by a logger the owner of a large integrated construction enterprise after inspection of the advertised tract.

The landholder could not afford to hire a lawyer and take legal action and made no attempt to assign any cause of action he might have had against the logger.

A party is an intended beneficiary of a promise if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties such as where the promisor knows that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The landholder's next-door neighbor lacks standing to enforce the logger-landholder contract because he is neither a party nor an assignee of the landholder's rights under the contract. He also lacks standing as a third party beneficiary because although the logger's performance of the contract may have benefited the neighbor the facts do not suggest that this was either party's intent when entering into the contract. Therefore the neighbor is merely an incidental beneficiary.\n</s>"

On March 2 the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a knitwear company on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the knitwear company order was for a rush job the knitwear company and the textile company included in their contract a liquidated damages clause providing that the textile company would pay $5000 for each day's delay in delivery after March 15. The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine and as a result the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the knitwear company. The textile company paid $25000 to the knitwear company as liquidated damages and now sues the mechanic for $25000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain little or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5000 liquidated damages clause in the knitwear-textile contract is valid which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic's best defense to the textile company's action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Time was not of the essence in the mechanic-textile contract.\nB. The mechanic had no reason to foresee on March 1 that the knitwear company would suffer consequential damages in the amount of $25000.\nC.

Damages to an injured buyer in a contract for the sale of real estate are usually measured by the difference between the contract price and the market value of the property as of the time that the buyer learned of the breach plus any incidental or consequential damages.

In measuring restitution to the breaching party the value of the benefit conferred should not exceed the contract price for such services. The subcontractor appears to have entered into a losing contract since the value of the services rendered up to the time of breach ($150000) exceeds the contract rate for such services ($100000). But because the subcontractor was the breaching party he is not entitled to recover the amount by which the reasonable value of his services exceeded the contract rate; rather he is limited to restitution of what he would have earned on the contract.\n</s>"

The delay did not materially harm the bank.\nB. The computer company believed on the assumption that the bank was getting a \"super deal\" for its money that the bank would not reject because of the late tender of delivery.\nC.

Indeed the UCC defines \"agreement\" as including the parties' express terms as well as those that are implied by applicable trade usage. Although the written contract between the computer company and the bank called for delivery \"on or before July 31\" the trade usage that the computer company seeks to introduce suggests that buyers should allow for up to 30-days' leeway beyond that date. If the contract were construed in light of this usage then the August 15 delivery would not be a breach of the contract and the bank would be in breach for refusing to take delivery on that date. The fact that buyers and sellers typically negate the usage with express language if the delivery date is to be construed strictly suggests that the trade usage is fairly persuasive evidence of the parties' intent.\n</s>"

At the time that it undertook to sell the mainframe computer the computer company was aware that the new technology it was planning to utilize was not yet perfected.

A month later the president handed the manager a written signed resolution of the company's Board of Directors stating that when and if the manager should decide to retire at his option the company in recognition of his past service would pay him a $2000-per-month lifetime pension. (The company had no regularized retirement plan for at-will employees.) Shortly thereafter the manager retired and immediately bought a $30000 recreational vehicle for his planned travels. After receiving the promised $2000 monthly pension from the insurance company for six months the manager now unemployable elsewhere received a letter from the insurance company advising him that the pension would cease immediately because of recessionary budget constraints affecting in varying degrees all managerial salaries and retirement pensions.

The manager's conversation with the company's president gave the insurance company reason to expect that a promise of a lifetime pension would induce reliance on the part of the manager. The manager relied in fact by retiring and spending $30000 on a trailer. Finally justice requires enforcement because the manager is no longer eligible for employment.\n</s>"

Which of the following will the court probably decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The breeder wins because the parties were mutually mistaken as to the boar's fertility when they made the agreement.\nB. The breeder wins because the seller impliedly warranted that the boar was fit for breeding.\nC. The seller wins because the breeder assumed the risk of the boar's sterility.\nD. The seller wins because any mistake involved was unilateral not mutual.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n A contract may be rescinded on grounds of mutual mistake of fact if the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract having a material effect on the exchange unless the court determines that the party asserting mistake should bear the risk of the mistake. The effect of the mistake was material to the value of the exchange in this case as it reduced the boar's value from $800 to $100. But the boar's fertility is not a fundamental assumption of the contract because both parties knew that fertility could not yet be determined at the time of sale. In addition although the breeder could not have investigated whether the boar was fertile at the time of sale it seems likely that the court nonetheless would find that the breeder implicitly assumed the risk of the boar's infertility since the breeder was aware of this possibility yet went forward with the purchase.\n</s>"

The sister's attorney advised that her claim was doubtful. The chef knowing only that the unresolved dispute existed agreed in a signed writing to pay the sister $6000 payable $1000 annually in exchange for a quitclaim deed (a deed containing no warranties) from the sister who promptly executed such a deed to the chef and received the chef's first annual payment. Shortly thereafter the probate court handed down a decision in the brother's favor ruling that the sister had no interest in the land. This decision has become final. The chef subsequently defaulted when his second annual installment came due. In an action against the chef for breach of contract the sister will probably\nAnswer Choices:\nA. lose because she was aware at the time of the agreement with the chef that her claim to the property quitclaimed was doubtful.\nB. lose because she suffered no legal detriment in executing the quitclaim deed.\nC. win because the chef bargained for and received in exchange a quitclaim deed from the sister.\nD. win because the chef by paying the first $1000 installment is estopped to deny that his agreement with the sister is an enforceable contract.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n In order to be enforceable a promise must be supported by consideration. Consideration is a return promise or performance which is bargained-for i.e. sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. Courts at law do not inquire into the adequacy of consideration as long as the consideration was bargained-for; it is often said that \"even a peppercorn will suffice\" for consideration. In exchange for the chef's promise to pay the sister $6000 the sister agreed to convey (and promptly conveyed) to the chef a quitclaim deed for a piece of property. Although the sister was aware that her claim to the property was doubtful and although the deed contained no warranty of title her promise to convey the quitclaim deed was sufficient consideration to support the chef's promise.\n</s>"

On January 8 before receipt of the seller's letter the buyer telephoned the seller and said \"I hereby revoke my order.\" The seller protested to no avail. The buyer received the seller's letter on January 9. Because of the buyer's January 8 telephone message the seller never shipped the goods. Under the relevant and prevailing rules is there a contract between the buyer and the seller as of January 10?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the order was an offer that could be accepted only by shipping the goods; and the offer was effectively revoked before shipment.\nB. No because the buyer never effectively agreed to the $10 price term.\nC. Yes because the order was for a reasonable time an irrevocable offer.\nD.

Under the mail box rule unless the offer specifies otherwise notice of acceptance is effective upon dispatch in the mail if a mailed acceptance is invited by the terms of the offer. Because the buyer's order was mailed the seller's properly stamped and addressed letter was invited by the terms of the offer and was therefore effective upon its dispatch on January 7. Because the buyer did not attempt to revoke the offer until January 8 the seller's acceptance created a contract.\n</s>"

The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier wrote the manufacturer demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed its latest audited financial statements to the supplier as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the lumber supplier for breach of contract. Will the manufacturer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the contract was unenforceable since the manufacturer had not committed to purchase a definite quantity of lumber.\nB. No because the supplier had reasonable grounds for insecurity and was therefore entitled to cancel the contract and refuse to make any future deliveries.\nC. Yes because the credit report and audited financial statements provided adequate assurance of due performance under the contract.\nD. Yes because the supplier was not entitled to condition resumption of deliveries on the receipt of financial status information.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n A party to a contract with reasonable grounds to worry that the other party might not perform can request adequate assurances of performance pursuant to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-609.

Therefore the supplier's refusal to continue performance constituted a breach of contract for which the manufacturer is entitled to compensation.\n</s>"

Has the contractor breached the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the oral modification was in good faith and therefore enforceable.\nB.

On February 1 at the debtor's request the creditor agreed to permit payment on February 5. On March 1 the debtor requested a similar time extension and the creditor replied \"Don't bother me each month. Just change the date of payment to the fifth of the month. But you must now make the payments by cashier's check.\" The debtor said \"Okay\" and made payments on March 5 and April 5. On April 6 the creditor sold the loan contract to a bank but did not tell the bank about the agreement permitting payments on the fifth of the month. On April 6 the bank wrote to the debtor: \"Your debt to [the creditor] has been assigned to us.

No because a contract modification is not binding on an assignee who had no knowledge of the modification.\nB. No because although the creditor waived the condition of payment on the first of the month the bank reinstated it.\nC. Yes because although the creditor waived the condition of payment on the first of the month the creditor could not assign to the bank his right to reinstate that condition.\nD.

One week after the chef was hired by the bakery a hotel offered the chef a position as a restaurant manager at a salary of $2500 a month.

The car dealer subsequently sold an automobile to a buyer at a price of $10000 payable at $1000 per month beginning on June 1. The car dealer then asked the bank whether the bank would accept payments of $1000 per month for 10 months beginning June 1 without interest in payment of the debt. The bank agreed to that arrangement and the car dealer then directed the buyer to make the payments to the bank. When the buyer tendered the first payment to the bank the bank refused the payment asserting that it would accept payment only from the car dealer. On June 2 the bank demanded that the car dealer pay the debt in full immediately. The car dealer refused to pay and the bank sued the car dealer to recover the $10000. In this suit which of the following arguments best supports the bank's claim for immediate payment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The agreement to extend the time for payment was not in writing.\nB. The car dealer could not delegate its duty to pay to the buyer.\nC. The car dealer gave no consideration for the agreement to extend the time of payment.\nD.

In performing each contract the seller delivered the grain to the buyer and upon delivery the buyer signed an invoice that showed an agreed upon price for that delivery. Each invoice was silent in regard to any discount from the price for prompt payment. The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery. In all of their prior transactions and without objection from the seller the buyer took 15 days to pay and deducted 5% from the invoice price. The same delivery procedure and invoice were used in the present contract as had been used previously. The present contract called for a single delivery of wheat at a price of $300000. The seller delivered the wheat and the buyer then signed the invoice. On the third day after delivery the buyer received the following note from the seller: \"Payment in full in accordance with signed invoice is due immediately. No discounts permitted.\" s/Seller. Which of the following statements concerning these facts is most accurate? \nAnswer Choices:\nA. The custom of the trade controls and the buyer is entitled to take a 2% discount if he pays within 10 days.\nB. The parties' course of dealing controls and the buyer is entitled to take a 5% discount if he pays within 15 days.\nC. The seller's retraction of his prior waiver controls and the buyer is entitled to no discount.\nD.

Therefore the agreement in this case should be interpreted to embody the course of dealing of the parties which provided for a 5% discount if payment was made within 15 days.

The rules for damages permit the separable components to be treated separately which is appropriate here since the structures were to be built on separate pieces of land and there were prices related to each distinct property. Another rationale for the divisibility of obligations is to avoid a forfeiture.\n</s>"

The uncle replied that he would lend the money to the nephew only if the nephew's mother \"guaranteed\" the loan. At the nephew's suggestion the uncle then telephoned the nephew's mother told her about the loan and asked if she would \"guarantee\" it. She replied \"Surely. Lend my son the $4000 and I'll repay it if he doesn't.\" The uncle then lent $4000 to the nephew an amount the nephew orally agreed to repay in six weeks. The next day the nephew's mother wrote to him and concluded her letter with the words \"Son I was happy to do you a favor by promising your uncle I would repay your six-week $4000 loan if you don't. /s/ Mother.\" Neither the nephew nor his mother repaid the loan when it came due and the uncle sued the mother for breach of contract. In that action the mother raised the statute of frauds as her only defense. Will the mother's statute-of-frauds defense be successful?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the amount of the loan was less than $5000.\nB. No because the mother's letter satisfies the statute-of-frauds requirement.\nC. Yes because the mother's promise to the uncle was oral.\nD. Yes because the nephew's promise to the uncle was oral.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The statute of frauds requires that promises to answer for the debt of another be made in writing. But the memorandum sufficient to satisfy the statute needn't be written at the time of the making of the promise nor need it be a writing addressed to the promisee. In this case the mother's letter to her son the nephew satisfies the requirement of the statute of frauds. Thus answer B is correct and answer C is incorrect.\n</s>"

The agreement provided that the buyer's obligation to purchase the parcel was expressly conditioned upon the buyer's obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10%. The buyer was unable to do so but did obtain a loan at an interest rate of 10.5% and timely tendered the purchase price. Because the value of the land had increased since the time of contracting the seller refused to perform. The buyer sued the seller. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because an express condition will only be excused to avoid forfeiture.\nB. No because the contract called for a loan at an interest rate not to exceed 10% and it could not be modified without the consent of the seller.\nC. Yes because the buyer detrimentally changed position in reliance on the seller's promise to convey.\nD. Yes because the buyer's obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10% was not a condition to the seller's duty to perform.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A duty of performance becomes absolute when conditions to performance are either met or excused. Courts look beyond the words of a condition and if it is clear that the purpose of the condition was to benefit or protect one of the parties the language of the condition will be interpreted as if that intention had been embodied in the contract terms. If a condition has not been met the party who was to have benefited by the condition may choose to either terminate his liability or waive the condition by proceeding under the contract. The party who was to benefit from the condition however is the only party who may elect to waive the condition; the performance of the other party is unaffected. In this case it is clear that the condition was intended for the benefit of the buyer. Because the condition was not met \u2013 i.e. the buyer did not secure a loan at an interest rate of 10% or lower and the condition was intended for the benefit of the buyer the buyer may elect to either terminate his performance under the contract or continue with his obligation to purchase the parcel. Because the condition of obtaining a loan at an interest rate of 10% or lower was designed to benefit the buyer not the seller the seller is still obligated to convey title to the parcel of land.\n</s>"

The one-year agreement provided for \"daily service at $500 a week.\" From their conversations during negotiation the laundry company knew that the innkeeper expected laundry services seven days a week. When the laundry company refused to pick up the motel's laundry on two successive Sundays and indicated that it would not ever do so the innkeeper canceled the agreement. The laundry company sued the innkeeper for breach of contract. At trial clear evidence was introduced to show that in the commercial laundry business \"daily service\" did not include service on Sundays.

No because the laundry company knew the meaning the innkeeper attached to \"daily service\" and therefore the innkeeper's meaning will control.\nB. No because the parties attached materially different meanings to \"daily service\" and therefore no contract was formed.\nC.

On May 29 relying on his expectation that he would finish the work and have the homeowner's payment on June 1 the carpenter contracted to buy a car for \"$10000 in cash if payment is made on June 1; if payment is made thereafter the price is $12000.\" The carpenter completed the work according to specifications on June 1 and demanded payment from the homeowner on that date. The homeowner without any excuse refused to pay. Thereupon the carpenter became very excited suffered a minor heart attack and as a result incurred medical expenses of $1000. The reasonable value of the carpenter's services in remodeling the homeowner's home was $13000. In an action by the carpenter against the homeowner which of the following should be the carpenter's measure of recovery?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $10000 the contract price.\nB. $11000 the contract price plus $1000 for the medical expenses incurred because the homeowner refused to pay.\nC. $12000 the contract price plus $2000 the bargain that was lost because the carpenter could not pay cash for the car on June 1.\nD. $13000 the amount the homeowner was enriched by the carpenter's services.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The carpenter is entitled to the contract price for the work done--$10000. The other items of damage are unrecoverable either because they were unforeseeable at the time the contract was made or because they were not caused by the breach. No unjust enrichment claim is viable on these facts because an unjust enrichment claim cannot exceed the contract price when all of the work giving rise to the claim has been done and the only remaining obligation is the payment of the price. This limitation on unjust enrichment claims was recapitulated in the well known case of Oliver v. Campbell 273 P.2d 15 (Cal. 1954) and represents the current rule in such cases.\n</s>"

The authorities offered the following reward: \"$20000 to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest and conviction of this fugitive.\" A private detective knew of the reward located the fugitive and brought him to the authorities who arrested him. The authorities then determined that while the fugitive had in fact committed the crime he had been directed to commit the crime by his boss. The authorities and the fugitive then agreed that in exchange for the fugitive's testimony against his boss all charges against the fugitive would be dropped. The fugitive testified and was released. The authorities refused to pay the reward to the private detective on the ground that the fugitive was never convicted. Would the private detective be likely to prevail in a breach of contract action against the authorities?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the private detective failed to notify the authorities that he had accepted the reward offer.\nB. No because the express conditions set out in the reward were not met.\nC.

The detective's entitlement to the award was subject to two conditions: the arrest and conviction of the fugitive. The first the arrest was satisfied when the detective delivered the fugitive to the authorities. The second the conviction did not occur. Its nonoccurrence is excused however under the doctrine of prevention which requires that a party refrain from conduct that prevents or hinders the occurrence of a condition.

In return the client agreed to pay the architect a fee of $10000 to be paid upon the house's completion. After completion the client claimed erroneously but in good faith that the architect's plans were defective. The client orally offered to pay the architect $7500 in full settlement of the claim for the fee. The architect orally accepted that offer despite the fact that the reasonable value of his services was in fact $10000. The client paid the architect $7500 pursuant to their agreement.

Will the architect be likely to prevail in his action against the client for $2500?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because payment of $7500 cannot furnish consideration for the architect's promise to surrender his claim.\nB. Yes because the oral agreement to modify the written contract is not enforceable.\nC.

An accord generally requires consideration which can be less than that called for in the original contract. Payment of a lesser amount than is due on a valid claim constitutes valid consideration if there is a bona fide dispute as to the amount owed and the dispute is made in good faith. Satisfaction is the performance of the accord and it discharges both the accord and the original debt. The architect's agreement to accept a payment for less than the amount due constituted an effective accord supported by consideration which was satisfied with the payment of $7500. Consideration is present because of the good faith dispute as to the amount owed. By compromising each party surrenders its respective claim as to how much is owed. \n</s>"

The builder orally offered to perform the work for $200000 if his pending bid on another project was rejected. The homeowner accepted the builder's terms and the builder then prepared a written contract that both parties signed. The contract did not refer to the builder's pending bid. One week later upon learning that his pending bid on the other project had been accepted the builder refused to perform any work for the homeowner. Can the homeowner recover for the builder's nonperformance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because efficiency principles justify the builder's services being directed to a higher-valued use.\nB. No because the builder's duty to perform was subject to a condition.\nC. Yes because the builder's attempt to condition his duty to perform rendered the contract illusory.\nD. Yes because the parol evidence rule would bar the builder from presenting evidence of oral understandings not included in the final writing.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The homeowner cannot recover for the builder's nonperformance based on the oral condition to the contract. Normally the parol evidence rule bars from evidence prior or contemporaneous negotiations and agreements that contradict modify or vary contractual terms if the contract is intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement. However the condition exception to the parol evidence rule permits the admission of extrinsic evidence to establish an oral condition to the parties' performance under the contract. Here the builder's acceptance of the contract was conditioned on the rejection of his bid on another project. This condition was not written in the contract. However as explained above this oral condition will be allowed into evidence as an exception to the parol evidence rule. Because the builder's bid was accepted on the other project the condition in the contract did not occur and the builder will not be in breach of the contract. Thus Answer B is correct and Answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

When the homeowner suffered a loss due to a theft that was within the policy's terms the insurance company refused to pay claiming that the contract was unenforceable because it violated the statute. Will the homeowner succeed in an action against the insurance company to recover for the loss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the insurance policy is not a divisible contract.\nB. No because the insurance policy violated the statute.\nC. Yes because the homeowner belongs to the class of persons intended to be protected by the statute.\nD. Yes because the insurance policy would be strictly construed against the insurance company as the drafter.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n A contract that violates a state statute may be declared unenforceable on grounds of public policy.

After completing 25 percent of the garage according to the homeowner's specifications the builder demanded $2000 as a reasonable progress payment. The homeowner refused and the builder abandoned the job. If each party sues the other for breach of contract which of the following will the court decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both parties are in breach and each is entitled to damages if any from the other.\nB. Only the builder is in breach and liable for the homeowner's damages if any.\nC.

The contract price was $100000 in cash payable one month after a truck carrier delivered the painting to the collector. The painting was damaged in transit. The collector timely rejected it after inspection and immediately notified the gallery of the rejection. The gallery then sold the painting to a third party. It informed the collector that it would pick up the painting within a couple of weeks. Two weeks later before the gallery picked up the painting the collector sold the painting to an art admirer for $120000 cash after notifying her about the damage. If the collector's sale of the painting was NOT an acceptance of the goods what is the maximum amount that the gallery is entitled to recover from the collector?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $120000 (damages for conversion).\nB. $100000 (the collector-gallery contract price).\nC. $20000 (the excess of the market price over the contract price).\nD. Only the allowance of lost profit to the gallery as a volume dealer.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The collector rightfully rejected the goods. However the collector's exercise of ownership of the painting after his original rejection caused the gallery to otherwise dispose of the goods. Therefore the collector's conduct in selling the painting was wrongful against the gallery and constituted conversion. The gallery should not be limited to the contract price for determining the value of the painting since the remedy for conversion is the fair market value of the goods at the time of the conversion. UCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-601 cmt. 2 1-103. The collector's sale of the painting for $120000 provides credible evidence of the painting's fair market value at the time of the conversion. In addition the gallery is not a lost volume seller since the painting was a one-of-a-kind good which means the gallery was operating at full capacity. Thus Answer A is correct and Answers B C and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

The contract expressly required that the excavator begin work on June 1 to enable other subcontractors to install utilities. On May 15 the excavator requested a 30-day delay in the start date for the excavation work because he was seriously behind schedule on another project. When the contractor refused to grant the delay the excavator stated that he would try to begin the work for the contractor on June 1. Does the contractor have valid legal grounds to cancel the contract with the excavator and hire a replacement?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the excavator committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract by causing the contractor to feel insecure about the performance.\nB. Yes because the excavator breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nC. No because the excavator would be entitled to specific performance of the contract if he could begin by June 1.\nD. No because the excavator did not state unequivocally that he would delay the beginning of his work.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n An anticipatory repudiation occurs when a party unequivocally manifests an intention not to perform or an inability to perform.

The clerk's position would be terminated due to the dissolution and he did not have a retirement plan. The accountant and the bookkeeper informed the clerk of their plan to fund an annuity for him. The clerk confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100000 to fund the annuity but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50000. The accountant agreed that the bookkeeper should contribute only $50000. Does the clerk have a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50000?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the clerk was bound by the modification of the agreement made by the accountant and the bookkeeper.\nB. No because the clerk was only a donee beneficiary of the agreement between the accountant and the bookkeeper and had no vested rights.\nC. Yes because the clerk's reliance on the promised retirement fund prevented the parties from changing the terms.\nD. Yes because the promises to establish the fund were made binding by consideration from the clerk's many years of employment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Generally parties who make a contract for an intended beneficiary retain the right to modify the duty by a subsequent contract. The power to modify is terminated however when the intended beneficiary materially changes his position in reliance on the promise. The clerk was an intended beneficiary of the promise between the accountant and the bookkeeper since their promise clearly intended to benefit the clerk. The clerk materially changed his position in reliance on the promise when he purchased a retirement home.

On March 2 the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer's order was for a rush job the two parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause providing that the textile company would pay $5000 for each day's delay in delivery after March 15.  The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine and as a result the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic's best defense to the textile company's action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Time was not of the essence in the contract between the mechanic and the textile company.\nB. The mechanic had no reason to foresee on March 1 that the customer would suffer consequential damages in the amount of $25000.\nC. By entering into the contract with the customer while knowing that its knitting machine was being repaired the textile company assumed the risk of any delay loss to the customer.\nD. In all probability the liquidated damages paid by the textile company to the customer are not the same amount as the actual damages sustained by the customer in consequence of the late delivery of the cloth.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Assuming other requirements are met an aggrieved party is entitled to recover consequential damages only if they were reasonably foreseeable to the breaching party.

Under the agreement the buyer was obligated to make a selection by March 1 of the quantities of the various candy bars to be delivered under the contract. The buyer did not make the selection by March 1 and on March 2 the seller notified the buyer that because of the buyer's failure to select the seller would not deliver the candy bars. The seller had all of the necessary candy bars on hand on March 1 and made no additional sales or purchases on March 1 or March 2. On March 2 after receiving the seller's notice that it would not perform the buyer notified the seller of its selection and insisted that the seller perform. The seller refused. If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract is the buyer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because a contract did not exist until selection of the specific candy bars and the seller withdrew its offer before selection.\nB. No because selection of the candy bars by March 1 was an express condition to the seller's duty to perform.\nC. Yes because a delay of one day in making the selection did not have a material effect on the seller.\nD. Yes because upon the buyer's failure to make a selection by March 1 the seller had a duty to make a reasonable selection.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n UCC \u00a7 2-311 imposes a duty on a buyer to cooperate by specifying the assortment of goods where the contract fails to so provide. A seller can treat the buyer's failure to specify as a breach by failure to accept the contracted-for goods only if the buyer's failure to specify materially impacts the seller's performance. The seller had an available supply of candy bars and had entered into no new contracts.

On the first day the home was offered for sale the homeowner gave a buyer a personal tour. The homeowner made no statements at all regarding the water damage or the roof. Without discovering the water damage or the leaking roof and without consulting a lawyer the buyer immediately agreed in writing to buy the home for $200000. Before the closing date the buyer discovered the water damage and the leaking roof. The cost of repair was estimated at $22000. The buyer has refused to go through with the purchase. If the homeowner sues the buyer for breach of contract is the homeowner likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because no contract was formed since the buyer did not have a real opportunity to understand the essential terms of the contract.\nB. No because the homeowner concealed evidence of the water damage and of the leaking roof.\nC. Yes because the homeowner made no affirmative statements of fact about the water damage or the leaking roof.\nD. Yes because the buyer acted unreasonably by failing to employ an inspector to conduct an independent inspection of the home.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A misrepresentation of fact that induces assent provides a basis for avoidance of a contract. A misrepresentation is defined as a statement that is not in accord with the facts. Affirmative conduct that is \"intended or known likely to prevent another from learning a fact is equivalent to an assertion that the fact does not exist\" and constitutes a misrepresentation. The homeowner's painting over the water damage constituted affirmative conduct intended to prevent the buyer from learning of the water damage and the leaking roof.

On Monday of the second week the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender. Was the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5000 pounds of flour?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because the bakery was legally entitled to reject any tender that did not conform perfectly to the contract.\nB. Yes because the tender was a substantial impairment of that installment and could not be cured.\nC. No because the tender was not a substantial impairment of the entire contract and the wholesaler had given assurance of a cure.\nD.

In fact in early October before the crop was harvested it was destroyed by a hailstorm. Is the rancher liable for the loss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because no time for performance was established in the contract.\nB. No because the neighbor failed to tell the rancher that the crop might be destroyed by a hailstorm.\nC.

Reason to foresee can arise from circumstances that result in the breaching party having had actual or constructive knowledge of the loss that might result from the breach. Therefore the neighbor's failure to specifically inform the rancher that the crop might be destroyed by a hailstorm does not determine whether the loss was foreseeable. Thus Answer B is incorrect. In this case the rancher's experience and the frequency of hailstorms in the fall combined to make the loss resulting from the rancher's breach foreseeable. Thus Answer C is correct.\n</s>"

Nothing because the contract is too indefinite.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The parties' new contract adopted the terms of their previous contract which included the 15% fee. Evidence of express terms is given greater weight than evidence of trade usage. Therefore the express term the 15% fee is controlling because a court would give it greater weight than the evidence of trade usage the 10% fee.\n</s>"

The loan proceeds were to be disbursed within two weeks. The merchant intended to use the loan proceeds to purchase a specific shipment of carpets for resale at an expected profit of $5000 but said nothing about these plans to the bank. The bank failed to disburse the proceeds and refused to assure the merchant that it would do so. The merchant was able to secure a loan from another lender at 10% interest for one year. However by the time the merchant started the application process for a substitute loan it was too late to pursue the opportunity to buy the shipment of carpets. In an action against the bank for breach of contract which of the following amounts is the merchant likely to recover?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Nothing because lost opportunities are not foreseeable.\nB. Nothing because the parties failed to tacitly agree that the merchant would be entitled to damages in the event of a breach by the bank.\nC. The difference in cost over time between a loan at 10% and a loan at 8%.\nD. $5000 the merchant's foreseeable loss.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The presumed wide availability of credit limits a borrower's recovery to the additional cost of obtaining a loan from another lender. In the typical case a lender has no reason at the time of contract formation to foresee that the borrower will not be able to obtain a substitute loan. Therefore the borrower's lost profit is considered unforeseeable at the time of contract formation. Here the merchant is entitled to recover the difference in cost over time between a loan at 10% and one at 8%. Thus Answer C is correct and Answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

The offer contained no terms except those specifying the amount and quality of the cotton. The seller then sent an acknowledgment by fax. The acknowledgment repeated the terms of the buyer's offer and stated that shipment would occur within five days. Among 12 printed terms on the acknowledgment was a statement that any dispute about the cotton's quality would be submitted to arbitration. Neither the buyer nor the seller said anything further about arbitration. The seller shipped the cotton and it was accepted by the buyer. A dispute arose between the buyer and the seller as to the quality of the cotton and the seller asserted that the dispute had to be submitted to arbitration. The buyer instead sued the seller in court. In that suit which of the following arguments best supports the seller's position that the buyer must submit the dispute to arbitration?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Arbitration is a more efficient method of resolving disputes than resolving them in court.\nB. The provision for arbitration did not contradict any term in the buyer's offer.\nC. The provision for arbitration did not materially alter the parties' contract.\nD. The seller's acknowledgment containing a provision for arbitration constituted a counteroffer that was accepted by the buyer when it accepted delivery of the cotton.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Because the buyer's offer was silent as to arbitration the arbitration provision in the seller's acknowledgment should be characterized as an additional term. Under UCC \u00a7 2-207(2) an additional term is considered a proposal for addition to the contract. Section 2-207(2) also provides that an additional term becomes a term of the parties' contract unless certain specified circumstances are present. One such circumstance is where an additional term materially alters the parties' contract. Because none of the other circumstances appear applicable here the arbitration provision will be considered a term of the contract if the seller can successfully argue that the provision did not materially alter the parties' contract. Thus Answer C is correct.\n</s>"

Under the terms of the contract the janitorial service agreed to clean the hospital daily in accordance with the hygiene standards of the city's health code. Because the janitorial service did not clean a patient's room in accordance with the required hygiene standards the patient contracted an infection that required continued hospitalization. In addition to suing the hospital the patient sued the janitorial service for breach of contract. Which of the following statements is most accurate with respect to the breach of contract claim against the janitorial service?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The janitorial service is liable to the patient as a matter of public policy because it violated the city's health code.\nB. The patient is an intended third-party beneficiary under the contract because the janitorial service's promise was intended to benefit all hospital patients.\nC. The patient has no claim for breach of contract against the janitorial service because she is an incidental beneficiary.\nD. The patient cannot sue on the contract because she was not named in the contract.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The patient cannot recover because she is an incidental beneficiary rather than an intended third-party beneficiary. In a typical third-party situation X (the promissee) contracts with Y (the promisor) that Y will render some performance to Z (the third-party beneficiary). Only an intended beneficiary has contractual rights not incidental beneficiaries. Factors to consider when determining if a party is an intended beneficiariary include: (i) whether the beneficiary is identified in the contract (ii) whether the beneficiary receives performance directly from the promisor or (iii) whether there is some relationship between the intended beneficiary and the promisee that indicates an intent to benefit the intended beneficiary. Here the circumstances fail to indicate that the hospital intended to give the patient the benefit of the promised performance. Thus Answer C is correct and Answer B is incorrect.\n</s>"

After the parties had performed under the agreement for three months the supplier notified the company that it would no longer give the company the 10%discount off the published prices. Does the company have a viable claim against the supplier for breach of contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes because part performance of the agreement by both parties made it enforceable for the full year.\nB. Yes because the company's agreement to buy all of its lawn care products from the supplier made the agreement enforceable.\nC.

The contract provided that delivery of the steel joists would begin on September 1. Although the general contractor had no reason to doubt the subcontractor's ability to perform the general contractor wanted to be sure that the subcontractor was on track for delivery in September. He therefore wrote a letter on July 1 to the subcontractor demanding that the subcontractor provide assurance of its ability to meet the September 1 deadline. The subcontractor refused to provide such assurance. The general contractor then immediately obtained the steel joists from another supplier. If the subcontractor sues the general contractor for breach of contract is the subcontractor likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the subcontractor anticipatorily repudiated the contract when it failed to provide adequate assurance.\nB. No because the contract failed to specify a definite quantity.\nC. Yes because a demand for assurance constitutes a breach of contract when the contract does not expressly authorize a party to demand assurance.\nD. Yes because the subcontractor's failure to provide assurance was not a repudiation since there were no reasonable grounds for the general contractor's insecurity.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The adequate assurance doctrine requires that a party respond to a demand for adequate assurance only if the demand is reasonable and justified. A demand is justified if the party making the demand has reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the other party's potential performance. The facts in this case state that the general contractor had no reason to doubt the subcontractor's ability to perform. Therefore the general contractor was unjustified in demanding adequate assurance and the subcontractor properly refused to respond to the demand. See UCC \u00a7 2-609.

The seller sued the buyer for breach of contract. Is the seller likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the buyer did not secure bank financing.\nB. No because the contract did not expressly impose on the buyer any obligation to apply for bank financing.\nC. Yes because a court will excuse the condition to avoid a disproportionate forfeiture.\nD.

Three months later the retail outlet sold the service portion of its business to an experienced and well-financed computer service company. The only provision in the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company relating to the outlet's contract with the bank stated that the outlet \"hereby assigns all of its computer service contracts to [the computer service company].\" The computer service company performed the monthly maintenance required under the service contract. Its performance was defective however and caused damage to the bank's operations. Whom can the bank sue for damages arising from the computer service company's defective performance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The retail outlet only because the computer service company made no promises to the bank.\nB. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company because the bank has not released the outlet and the bank is an intended beneficiary of the outlet's agreement with the computer service company.\nC. Either the retail outlet or the computer service company because since each has the right to enforce the bank's performance of its contract with the retail outlet mutuality of remedy renders either potentially liable for the defective performance.\nD. The computer service company only because it is a qualified and a financially responsible supplier of computer services.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The retail outlet effectively delegated to the computer service company the outlet's duty of performance owed to the bank. However absent consent by the obligee (the bank) or performance by the delegatee (the computer service company) an effective delegation does not relieve the delegating party (the retail outlet) of its duty to the obligee. When the computer service company purchased the service contracts the bank also became an intended beneficiary of the computer service company's promise to the retail outlet. The computer service company expressly agreed with the retail outlet to perform the outlet's obligation to the bank making the bank an intended beneficiary of that obligation.

When the wheat arrived at the destination the buyer discovered that the farmer had delivered only 96000 bushels. The buyer sued the farmer for breach of contract. At the trial of the case the court found that the written contract was intended as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement. The farmer offered to prove that in the wheat business a promise to deliver a specified quantity is considered to be satisfied if the delivered quantity is within 5% of the specified quantity. The buyer objected to the offered evidence. Is the court likely to admit the evidence offered by the farmer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because the offered evidence is inconsistent with the express language of the agreement.\nB. No because the written contract was totally integrated.\nC. Yes because the offered evidence demonstrates that the farmer substantially performed the contract.\nD. Yes because the offered evidence explains or supplements the agreement by usage of trade.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This transaction involves a sale of goods and is subject to UCC Article 2. Under Article 2 evidence of trade usage that can be construed as reasonably consistent with an agreement's express language is admissible to interpret or supplement an agreement. The majority rule provides that trade usage will be viewed as consistent with an agreement's express language unless the usage completely negates specific express language. The trade usage allowing for a variation of up to 5% does not completely negate but rather qualifies the express language calling for the delivery of 100000 bushels of wheat. Thus Answer D is correct and Answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect. the rule stated above applies regardless of whether the written agreement is a complete integration.\n</s>"

The borrower responded \"I will attempt to get the money together.\" On January 11 the lender again telephoned the borrower and said that he had changed his mind and would expect the borrower to make full payment on March 1.

The borrower's January 10 statement was not a return promise and therefore the lender effectively revoked his offer on January 11.\nB. The January 10 telephone conversation between the lender and the borrower created an executory accord and therefore did not operate as a discharge of the $50000 debt.\nC.

This offer is not subject to countermand. Sincerely [signed] the pharmaceutical salesman The widget salesman replied by mail the following day: I accept your offer and promise to deliver the bike as you specified. Sincerely [signed] the widget salesman  This letter although properly addressed was misdirected by the postal service and not received by the pharmaceutical salesman until November 10. The pharmaceutical salesman had bought another Sujocki bike from a different friend for $1050 a few hours before. The friend saw the widget salesman at the Interurban Country Club on November 11 and said: \"I sold my Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman yesterday for $1050.

The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15 and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2500 on March 15; $2500 when the boathouse was completed; $5000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel. Assume that the landowner paid the $2500 on March 15 and that the builder completed the boathouse according to specifications but that the landowner then refused to pay the second installment and repudiated the contract. Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense. Which of the following is (are) correct? I. The builder has a cause of action against the landowner and his damages will be $2500. II. The builder can refuse to dig the channel and not be liable for breach of contract.\nAnswer Choices:\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. Both I and II\nD. Neither I nor II\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation an unequivocal statement of unwillingness or inability to perform a future contractual obligation if material may be treated as a total breach of that obligation. Once a repudiation occurs the non-repudiating party is discharged from any further performance under the contract and may immediately recover damages for total breach. When a contractor is injured due to an owner's total breach of a construction contract the contractor generally can recover his expected profit on the entire contract along with any labor and material expenses incurred up until the time that he learned of the owner's breach minus any progress payments made by the owner. Although the landowner repudiated the agreement just after the second $2500 progress payment became due the builder would be entitled to obtain as damages not only the progress payment but also his expected profit on the entire contract. Because these damages likely would exceed $2500 statement I is incorrect. The builder is also entitled to withhold his remaining performance under the contract. Therefore statement II is correct.\n</s>"

The father agreed to make payments of $2000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1 2001 upon monthly presentation of certificate by Builders Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001 when he also began building the house. The father made three $2000 payments for the work done in July August and September 2001 without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October but no work was done from November 1 2001 to the end of February 2002 because of bad weather and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1 2002 the contractor demanded payment of $2000 but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. Assuming that the contractor committed a total breach on March 1 2002 what would be the probable measure of the father's damages in an action against the contractor for breach of contract? \nAnswer Choices:\nA. Restitution of the three monthly installments paid in August September and October\nB. What it would cost to get the house completed by another contractor minus installments not yet paid to the contractor\nC. The difference between the market value of the partly built house as of the time of the contractor's breach and the market value of the house if completed according to specifications\nD. In addition to other legally allowable damages an allowance for the father's mental distress if the house cannot be completed in time for his son's wedding on June 10 2002\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The father is entitled to damages representing the reasonable cost of completion which is an amount equal to what another contractor would require to complete performance minus what the father would have paid to the contractor to complete performance.\n</s>"

All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before May 1. A student read this notice on November 2 and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law which he started in October a winner. The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying \"I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer.\" This note was inadvertently placed in the student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1 the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. The student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1 it was announced that the student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $500. The law faculty refused to pay anything. As to the student was the offer effectively revoked?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes by the faculty's second notice.\nB. No because it became irrevocable after a reasonable time had elapsed.\nC. No because of the student's reliance prior to April 1 on the offer.\nD. No unless the student became aware of the April 1 posting and removal before submitting the paper.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Where an offer is for a unilateral contract (an offer that seeks only performance and does not seek a return promise) and the offeree begins the invited performance the offeror may not revoke the promise. This rule is intended to protect the substantial reliance of the offeree that results when accepting an offer for a unilateral contract by performance over a period of time. Because the faculty's offer of $500 sought only performance (winning the competition) and did not seek a commitment to perform it was an offer for a unilateral contract. Once the student commenced performance the faculty was not free to revoke the offer so its attempted revocation on April 1 was ineffective.\n</s>"

The promise that the man made to the purchaser on March 1 was not an option promise because it was not supported by consideration. The man's March 12 statement that the car had been sold was effective as a revocation even though untrue because it manifested the man's intention not to enter into the contract and it was made prior to the purchaser's attempted acceptance.\n</s>"

For a consideration of $5000 the landowner gave his neighbor a written option to purchase Broadacres for $300000. The option was assignable. For a consideration of $10000 the neighbor subsequently gave an option to his friend to purchase Broadacres for $325000. The friend exercised his option. The neighbor thereupon exercised his option. The neighbor paid the agreed price of $300000 and took title to Broadacres by deed from the landowner. Thereafter the friend refused to consummate his purchase. The neighbor brought an appropriate action against the friend for specific performance or if that should be denied then for damages. The friend counterclaimed for return of the $10000. In this action the court will \nAnswer Choices:\nA. grant money damages only to the neighbor.\nB. grant specific performance to the neighbor.\nC. grant the neighbor only the right to retain the $10000.\nD. require the neighbor to refund the $10000 to the friend.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n An option promise is a promise not to revoke an offer to enter into a contract and it requires separate consideration to be enforceable. When a party exercises an option that party in effect accepts the offer and binds himself to the contract. The friend paid the neighbor $10000 in exchange for the neighbor's promise not to revoke his offer to sell. When the friend exercised the option he became obligated to purchase Broadacres for $325000 and his failure to consummate his purchase entitled the neighbor to pursue remedies for breach of contract. Specific performance generally will be awarded for breach of contract where an award of monetary damages would be inadequate or impracticable. Contracts involving the sale of land historically have been regarded as unique and therefore equitable relief traditionally has been allowed even where the breaching party is the buyer. Because the obligation that the neighbor seeks to enforce is the friend's obligation to purchase Broadacres (a contract to purchase land) specific performance will be awarded.\n</s>"

The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40000 upon the landowner's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further under a \"liquidated damages\" clause in the agreement the builder promised to pay the landowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1. The landowner however told the builder on January 2 before the contract was signed that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1. The builder completed the house on October 14 and when the landowner returned on November 1 requested the final payment of $40000 and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. The landowner however refused to pay any part of the final installment after the architect told him that the builder \"did a great job and I find no defects worth mentioning; but the builder's contract price was at least $40000 too high especially in view of the big drop in housing values within the past ten months. I will withhold the final certificate and you just hold on to your money.\" If the builder sues the landowner for the $40000 final payment after the architect's refusal to issue a final certificate which of the following will the court probably decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The builder wins because nonoccurrence of the condition requiring the architects's certificate of final approval was excused by the architects's bad-faith refusal to issue the certificate.\nB. The builder wins but because all contractual conditions have not occurred her recovery is limited to restitution of the benefit conferred on the landowner minus progress payments already received.\nC. The landowner wins provided he can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the fair-market value of the completed house is $160000 or less.\nD. The landowner wins provided he can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the total payment to the builder of $160000 will yield a fair net profit.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The condition in the contract requiring a certificate of final approval was withheld in bad faith and will be excused.

On September 25 the 84-year-old man and the geriatric company entered into a written lifetime care contract with an effective commencement date of October 1. The full contract price was $20000 which as required by the terms of the contract the 84-year-old man prepaid to the geriatric company on September 25. The 84-year-old man died of a heart attack on October 2.

Yes because the geriatric company would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the 84-year-old man's expense.\nB. Yes under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\nC. No because the 84-year-old man's life span and the duration of the geriatric company's commitment to him was a risk assumed by both parties.\nD. No but only if the geriatric company can show that between September 25 and the 84-year-old man's death it rejected because of its commitment to the 84-year-old man an application for lifetime care from another elderly person.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Restitution generally is not available to recover a benefit conferred pursuant to a valid and binding contract.

In this case the contract between the sister and brother provided that they would each pay $500 to their mother each month.

The manufacturer orally accepted this offer and promptly sent the following letter to the retailer which the retailer received two days later: \"This confirms our agreement today by telephone to sell you 500 large bath towels for 30-day delivery. /s/ Manufacturer.\" Twenty-eight days later the manufacturer tendered to the retailer 1000 (not 500) conforming bath towels all of which the retailer rejected because it had found a better price term from another supplier. Because of a glut in the towel market the manufacturer cannot resell the towels except at a loss. In a suit by the manufacturer against the retailer which of the following will be the probable decision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The manufacturer can enforce a contract for 1000 towels because the retailer ordered and the manufacturer tendered that quantity.\nB. The manufacturer can enforce a contract for 500 towels because the manufacturer's letter of confirmation stated that quantity term.\nC.

The writing need not contain all of the terms of the contract but it is only enforceable to the extent of the quantity term stated in the writing. The contract between the manufacturer and the retailer falls within the UCC Statute of Frauds because it is for over $500. However when dealing with two merchants there is something called the Confirmatory Memo Rule. In contracts between merchants if one party within a reasonable time after an oral understanding has been reached sends a written confirmation to the other party that binds the sender it will satisfy the Statute of Frauds requirements against the recipient as well if the recipient knew of the memo's contents and failed to object to the memo's contents in writing within 10 days of when the confirmatory memo was received.\n</s>"

The developer told the buyer that the lot abutted a national park and that the water for the house came from a natural artesian spring. The developer knew that both of these representations were important to the buyer and that both were false. The buyer moved into the house and eight months later learned that a private golf course was being constructed on the adjacent land and that the water for his house was piped in from the city reservoir. The buyer immediately sued the developer to avoid the contract. The construction of the golf course will probably increase the market value of the buyer's property and the water from the city reservoir exceeds all established standards for drinking water. Is the buyer likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No because eight months exceeds a reasonable time for contract avoidance.\nB.

The time period within which a party may avoid a contract due to misrepresentation does not begin to run until that party either knows or has reason to know of the misrepresentation. In this case the buyer's eight-month delay will not preclude him from avoiding the contract because he did not learn of the misrepresentation until eight months after the parties entered into the contract; the buyer immediately sought to avoid the contract after learning of the misrepresentation.

And besides if you won't sell me the house for that price maybe I won' t visit you anymore either.\" \"Oh I wouldn't want that\" said the mother and she signed a contract selling the house to her daughter for $100000. Shortly thereafter the mother died. When her son found out that the house had been sold and was not part of his mother's estate he sued to have the contract avoided on behalf of the mother. On what ground would the contract most likely be avoided?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Duress.\nB. Inadequate consideration.\nC. Mistake.\nD. Undue influence.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nContracts\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A contract is voidable if the elements of undue influence--undue susceptibility to pressure and excessive pressure--are established. The undue susceptibility element can be established either by the circumstances (e.g. the mother's illness) or the existence of a confidential relationship (such as a parent-child relationship). The following facts support a finding of excessive pressure: the daughter's statement that she might not visit her mother the daughter pressuring her mother to sell the property while her mother was in a hospice facility the mother assenting without obtaining independent advice and the mother's susceptibility to pressure.\n</s>"

The state's law of intestate succession provides that an unacknowledged illegitimate child may not inherit his father's property.

The illegitimate child filed suit in an appropriate court alleging that the state statute barring an illegitimate child from sharing in a parent's estate is invalid, and that he should be declared a lawful heir to his father's estate. In challenging the validity of the state statute, the illegitimate child's strongest argument would be that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. there is no rational basis for preferring as heirs collateral relatives and even the state over unacknowledged children, and, therefore, the law violates the equal protection clause.\nB. he has been deprived of property without due process because his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need.\nC. it violates the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. it is a denial of procedural due process because it does not give the unacknowledged illegitimate child an opportunity to prove paternity.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The state statute does not classify on the basis of legitimacy, but on the basis of acknowledgment of children.

On a weekday at 12:00 noon, he delivered an excited, animated, and loud harangue on the steps of the State Capitol in front of the main entryway. An audience of 200 onlookers, who gathered on the steps, heckled him and laughed as he delivered his tirade. The owner of the manufacturing firm repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that \"the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid,\" and that \"I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live.\" After about fifteen minutes the owner of the manufacturing firm stopped speaking, and the amused crowd dispersed. There is one relevant statute of the state which prohibits \"all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m.-8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m.-1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m.-5:15 p.m. on Capitol working days.\" If the owner of the milk container manufacturing firm is prosecuted under the \"Capitol Steps\" statute and defends on constitutional grounds, which of the following best describes the proper burden of proof?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The challenger would have to prove that the state did not have a rational basis for enacting this statute.\nB. The challenger would have to prove that the state did not have a compelling need for this statute or that it had less restrictive means by which it could satisfy that need.\nC. The state would have to prove that it had a rational basis for enacting this statute.\nD.

When a statute is content neutral and regulates speech only as a secondary effect, a court will use intermediate scrutiny to determine if the regulation is a constitutional restriction on freedom of speech. When a statute regulates protected speech in a public forum, the state must prove that the statute is content neutral, serves an important government interest, leaves open ample alternative channels of communication, and is narrowly tailored to achieve the government's purpose. In this fact pattern, the statute is content neutral because it does not prohibit speech on a particular subject matter or view point, and the statute is regulating speech in a public forum. The state must therefore prove that the restriction serves an important government interest and that the means to achieve that purpose are narrowly tailored.

There are three relevant statutes of the state. The first statute prohibits \"all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m.-8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m.-1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m.-5:15 p.m. on Capitol working days.\" A second state statute punishes \"any person who shall intentionally threaten the life or safety of any public official for any act which he performed as part of his public office.\" A third state statute, enacted in 1880, makes criminal \"the utterance in any public place of any blasphemy or sacrilege.\" Assume that there have been only a few recorded prosecutions under the 1880 statute. The milk container manufacturing firm owner is charged with violating its proscriptions. The charge is based wholly on the speech he delivered on the steps of the State Capitol. Which of the following constitutional defenses to this prosecution under the 1880 statute would be the LEAST likely to succeed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. This statute is vague and, therefore, violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB.

A is stronger because the terms \"blasphemy or sacrilege\" would likely be considered unconstitutionally vague. B is also stronger because blasphemy or sacrilege are \"crimes\" against a particular religion, and for the state to prosecute them would be for the state to support that religion. D is stronger because the law at issue is content based, and the state cannot limit speech on the basis of content unless the limitation satisfies strict scrutiny. And the Fourteenth Amendment is what makes the First Amendment applicable to the states, so it is the amendment which would be violated.\n</s>"

The tract was divided into 60 lots, appropriate utilities were installed, and a plat of the entire tract, including a Declaration of Restrictions, was properly drawn and recorded. The Declaration of Restriction included the following: \"3. Ownership and/or occupancy are restricted to persons 21 years of age or over, one family per lot.\" As the separate lots were sold, the deed to each lot included the following provision: \"As shown on recorded plat [properly identified by page and plat book reference] and subject to the restrictions therein contained.\" One of the lots was purchased by a man, who now resides in a mobile home on the lot together with his wife and two children, aged 11 and 13. Other lot owners in the subdivision brought action against the man to enjoin further occupancy by the children under 21 years of age.

B is incorrect because, while the restriction might constitute a restraint on alienation, the man is not trying to sell or buy it. He was allowed to buy it--it is his children's continued occupancy that has been challenged.

The court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. deny the motion because of the independence of the federal judiciary constitutionally guaranteed by Article III.\nB. deny the motion, because the woman has established a property right to her federal employment on the tribunal.\nC. grant the motion, because the woman lacked standing to raise the question.\nD. grant the motion, because the woman was not a judge under Article III and is not entitled to life tenure.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Congress has the power to create special Courts under Article I, and the judges for those courts do not have the protections of Article III, such as life tenure and the guarantee of no reduction in salary.

A is not correct because the woman was not an Article III judge, and because Congress can create judicial positions in special tribunals that are not Article III positions.

Additionally, the interstate highway system impacts interstate commerce, and therefore its maintenance and condition are related to Congress' commerce power. Both give Congress broad power to enact legislation. As long as the legislation is reasonably related to a legitimate federal goal, it is constitutional. A speed limit of 55 miles per hour is reasonably related to highway safety, a legitimate federal goal. Therefore the statute is constitutional.\n</s>"

The police officer who responded to the call knew that the defendant was in jail. He recognized the stench coming from the defendant's apartment as that of decomposing flesh and, without waiting to obtain a warrant and using the landlord's passkey, entered the apartment with the landlord's consent. The lease to these premises gave the landlord a right of entry, at any reasonable hour, for the purpose of making repairs.

None of its provisions conflicts with federal statutes. The state election code provides that in a special-purpose election for directors of a state watershed improvement district, the franchise is limited to landowners within the district, because they are the only ones directly affected by the outcome. Each vote is weighted according to the proportion of the holding of that individual in relation to the total affected property.

The statute provides that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \"shall, on a current basis, spend all of the money appropriated for this purpose\" and \"shall distribute the appropriated funds\" by a specified formula to state health departments that agree to participate in the program. In the current year Congress has appropriated $100 million for expenditure on this program. In order to ensure a budget surplus in the current fiscal year, the President issued an executive order directing the various cabinet secretaries to cut expenditures in this year by 10 percent in all categories. He also orders certain programs to be cut more drastically because he believes that \"they are not as important to the general welfare as other programs.\" The President identifies the dental education program as such a program and orders it to be cut by 50 percent. Assume that no other federal statutes are relevant.

Such a spanking occurs not more than once a month and has never physically harmed the child. The state files suit under the statute to terminate the father's parental rights solely because of these spankings. The father defends only on the ground that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied to his admitted conduct. In light of the nature of the rights involved, which of the following is the most probable burden of persuasion on this constitutional use?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to the father is necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest.\nB. The state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to the father is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nC.

The state of Midland has a state statute that provides \"Possession of snipe traps is prohibited. Any game warden finding a snipe trap within the state shall seize and destroy it.\" Snipe traps cost about $15 each. An ardent snipe trapper is a resident of West Hampton. She drove her car to East Winnetka to purchase a new snipe trap from a manufacturer there.

The snipe trapper can demonstrate that common carriers are permitted to transport snipe traps as cargo across Midland for delivery to another state and that in practice the Midland statute is enforced only against private individuals transporting those traps in private vehicles. If the trapper challenges the application of the Midland statute to her on the basis only of a denial of equal protection, the application of the statute will probably be found\nAnswer Choices:\nA. constitutional, because the traps constitute contraband in which the snipe trapper could have no protected property interest.\nB. constitutional, because there is a rational basis for differentiating between the possession of snipe traps as interstate cargo by common carriers and the possession of snipe traps by private individuals.\nC. unconstitutional, because the state cannot demonstrate a compelling public purpose for making this differentiation between common carriers and such private individuals.\nD. unconstitutional, because interstate travel is a fundamental right that may not be burdened by state law.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Because the statute does not classify on any suspect grounds, rational basis is the test that would apply.

The federal rule preempts the Midland state statute, because the federal rule regulates the same subject matter, snipe traps.\nB. The federal rule preempts the Midland state statute, because the federal rule does not contain affirmative authorization for continued state regulation.\nC. The federal rule does not preempt the Midland state statute, because the Midland state statute regulates wild animals, a field of exclusive state power.\nD.

The defendant was convicted of violating this statute on three separate occasions. Following his most recent conviction, he professed to have undergone a religious conversion and proclaimed himself to be the divine minister of \"St. Rockport,\" an alleged messiah who would shortly be making his appearance on earth. The defendant solicited cash donations from the public to support his efforts to spread the word of St. Rockport and his coming appearance on earth. Following complaints by several contributors who claimed he defrauded them, the defendant was again charged with fraud under this state statute. The charge was that the defendant \"should have known that his representations about St. Rockport were false and, therefore, that he made them solely to collect cash donations for his personal gain.\" A witness for the prosecution in the defendant's trial stated that the defendant had admitted that, at times, he had doubts about the existence of St. Rockport. The defendant was the only religious minister prosecuted for fraud under this state statute. The strongest constitutional defense that the defendant could assert would be that this prosecution\nAnswer Choices:\nA. deprived him of the equal protection of the laws because other religious ministers have not been charged under this statute.\nB. denied him procedural due process because it placed upon the defendant the burden of rebutting evidence, submitted by the state of his bad faith in raising this money.\nC. denied him rights conferred by the obligation of contracts clause by preventing him from taking money from persons who wished to contract with him to spread the word of St. Rockport.\nD. denied him the free exercise of religion in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it required the state to determine the truth or falsity of the content of his religious beliefs.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The government cannot impose a burden on someone because of that person's religious beliefs unless the measure is necessary to promote a compelling government interest.

A federal statute authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to permit interstate carriers to discontinue entirely any unprofitable route. The interstate bus company applied to the ICC for permission to drop a very unprofitable route through the sparsely populated Shaley Mountains. The ICC granted that permission even though the interstate bus company provided the only public transportation into the region. A man is the owner of a mountain resort in the Shaley Mountains, whose customers usually arrived on vehicles operated by the interstate bus company. After exhausting all available federal administrative remedies, the man filed suit against the interstate bus company in the trial court of the state in which the Shaley Mountains are located to enjoin the discontinuance by the interstate bus company of its service to that area. The man alleged that the discontinuance of service by the interstate bus company would violate a statute of that state prohibiting common carriers of persons from abandoning service to communities having no alternate form of public transportation. The state court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. dismiss the action, because the man lacks standing to sue.\nB. direct the removal of the case to federal court, because this suit involves a substantial federal question.\nC. hear the case on its merits and decide for the man because, on these facts, a federal agency is interfering with essential state functions.\nD. hear the case on its merits and decide for the interstate bus company, because a valid federal law preempts the state statute on which the man relies.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution requires that where a state law conflicts with a valid federal law, the federal law preempts that state law. And because regulating interstate carriers is within Congress's commerce clause power, the federal law is valid. Answer A is incorrect because the man has standing. He has an injury to his business that was caused by the federal action, and prohibiting the discontinuance would remedy his injury. Answer B is incorrect because states have concurrent jurisdiction to decide federal questions, since state courts are courts of general jurisdiction. Answer C is incorrect because regulating interstate common carriers is not an essential state function; rather, it is a quintessential federal function.\n</s>"

The state supreme court agreed and held the tax law to be invalid. It said: \"We hold that this state tax law violates the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution and also the equal protection clause of the state constitution because we interpret that provision of the state constitution to contain exactly the same prohibition against discriminatory legislation as is contained in the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" The state sought review of this decision in the United States Supreme Court, alleging that the state supreme court's determination of the federal constitutional issue was incorrect. How should the United States Supreme Court dispose of the case if it believes that this interpretation of the federal Constitution by the state supreme court raises an important federal question and is incorrect on the merits?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Reverse the state supreme court decision, because the equal protection clause of a state constitution must be construed by the state supreme court in a manner that is congruent with the meaning of the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution.\nB. Reverse the state supreme court decision with respect to the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution and remand the case to the state supreme court for further proceedings, because the state and federal constitutional issues are so intertwined that the federal issue must be decided so that this case may be disposed of properly.\nC.

The United States Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the case because the case raises a federal question - the constitutionality of a state statute - and the Supreme Court will exercise that jurisdiction because it has deemed the question important. However, there is a chance that the state Supreme Court might interpret its own Constitution differently than the United States Supreme Court interpreted the United States Constitution. And for that reason, the Supreme Court will remand the case to the state to give it the opportunity to interpret its own constitutional provision, knowing accurately what the United States Constitution would require.\n</s>"

The statute provides that the Commission may issue a license authorizing the construction of a proposed nuclear energy plant 30 days after the Commission makes a finding that the plant will comply with specified standards of safety, technological and commercial feasibility, and public convenience. In a severable provision, the Commission's enabling statute also provides that the Congress, by simple majorities in each house, may veto the issuance of a particular license by the Commission if such a veto occurs within 30 days following the required Commission finding. Early last year, the Commission found that a particular energy company, met all statutory requirements and, therefore, voted to issue the energy company a license authorizing it to construct a nuclear energy plant. Because they believed that the issuance of a license to the energy company was not in accord with the applicable statutory criteria, a majority of each of the two houses of Congress voted, within the specified 30-day period, to veto the license. On the basis of that veto, the Commission refused to issue the license. Subsequently, the energy company sued the Commission in an appropriate federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the Commission's refusal to issue the license. In this suit, the court should hold the congressional veto of the license of the energy company to be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. invalid, because any determination by Congress that particular agency action does not satisfy statutory criteria violates Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution because it constitutes the performance of a judicial function by the legislative branch.\nB. invalid, because Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution has been interpreted to mean that any action of Congress purporting to alter the legal rights of persons outside of the legislative branch must be presented to the President for his signature or veto.\nC. valid, because Congress has authority under the commerce clause to regulate the construction of nuclear energy plants.\nD. valid, because there is a compelling national interest in the close congressional supervision of nuclear plant siting in light of the grave dangers to the public health and safety that are associated with the operation of such plants.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Article I, \u00a7 7, cl. 3 of the United States Constitution provides that any matter that the houses of Congress can accomplish by majority vote must be presented to the President for signature or veto before it can have effect.

As a result, it enacted an ordinance prohibiting all sales to the public of food or other items by persons selling directly from trucks, cars, or other vehicles located on city streets. The ordinance included an inseverable grandfather provision exempting from its prohibition vendors who, for 20 years or more, have continuously sold food or other items from such vehicles located on the streets of the city. A retail vendor of ice cream products qualifies for this exemption and is the only food vendor that does. A yogurt retailer has a business similar to the ice cream vendor, but the yogurt vendor has been selling to the public directly from trucks located on the streets of the city only for the past ten years. The yogurt vendor filed suit in an appropriate federal district court to enjoin the enforcement of this ordinance on the ground that it denies the yogurt vendor the equal protection of the laws. In this case, the court will probably rule that the ordinance is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. constitutional, because it is narrowly tailored to implement the city's compelling interest in reducing traffic congestion and, therefore, satisfies the strict scrutiny test applicable to such cases.\nB. constitutional, because its validity is governed by the rational basis test, and the courts consistently defer to economic choices embodied in such legislation if they are even plausibly justifiable.\nC. unconstitutional, because the nexus between the legitimate purpose of the ordinance and the conduct it prohibits is so tenuous and its provisions are so under inclusive that the ordinance fails to satisfy the substantial relationship test applicable to such cases.\nD. unconstitutional, because economic benefits or burdens imposed by legislatures on the basis of grandfather provisions have consistently been declared invalid by courts as per se violations of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The ordinance at issue regulates who may sell food from vehicles on the streets.

Pursuant to this federal law and all proper federal procedural requirements, that agency has adopted very strict standards for the licensing of such facilities. As a result, the cost of disposing of tires in licensed facilities is substantial. A particular state has a very large fleet of motor vehicles, including trucks used to support state-owned commercial activities and police cars. The state disposes of used tires from both kinds of state motor vehicles in a stated-owned and -operated facility. This state facility is unlicensed, but its operation in actual practice meets most of the standards imposed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency on facilities it licenses to dispose of tires. Consistent with United States Supreme Court precedent, may the state continue to dispose of its used tires in this manner?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a state must comply with valid federal laws that regulate matters affecting interstate commerce.\nB. No, because some of the tires come from vehicles that are used by the state solely in its commercial activities.\nC. Yes, because some of the tires come from vehicles that are used by the state in the performance of core state governmental functions such as law enforcement.\nD.

Likewise, answer C is incorrect. The disposal of tires is not something that is part of the performance of core state governmental functions even if the use of tires is.

The statute contains an inseverable condition requiring that any courthouse restored with the aid of such a grant must be equipped with ramps and other facilities necessary to accommodate physically handicapped people. A law of a particular state requires public buildings in the state to have ramps and other facilities for handicapped people. It exempts from those requirements any building that is more than 70 years old if the State Board of Architects finds that the installation of such facilities would destroy the architectural integrity of the building. The county courthouse in the state was built in 1895 and is still in use. It does not contain ramps or other special facilities for handicapped people. The State Board of Architects has determined that the installation of those facilities would destroy the architectural integrity of the building. The county board applies for a federal grant to restore and preserve that county's courthouse. If the county board restores the courthouse with the aid of a federal restoration and preservation grant, is the board bound to install ramps and other facilities for handicapped people in that building?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because Congress may impose reasonable conditions related to the public welfare on grants of federal funds to public bodies when the public bodies are free to accept or reject the grants.\nB. Yes, because the rights of handicapped and disabled people are fundamental rights that take precedence, as a constitutional matter, over considerations of architectual integrity.\nC. No, because the Constitution does not authorize the federal government to direct the actions of the states or any of their political subdivisions with respect to matters affecting their own governmental buildings.\nD.

The competitor is a reliable organization that uses a process for testing and approving fabrics for flame retardancy identical in all respects to that used by the Zetest Testing Company.

Public schools also receive other revenue from private gifts, federal grants, student fees, and local sales taxes. For many years, the state has distributed additional funds, which come from the state treasury, to local school districts in order to equalize the funds available on a per-student basis for each public school district. These additional funds are distributed on the basis of a state statutory formula that considers only the number of students in each public school district and the real estate tax revenue raised by that district. The formula does not consider other revenue received by a school district from different sources. The school boards of two school districts, together with parents and schoolchildren in those districts, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the state from allocating the additional funds from the state treasury to this formula. They allege that the failure of the state, in allocating this additional money, to take into account a school district's sources of revenue other than revenue derived from taxes levied on real estate located there violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The complaint does not allege that the allocation of the additional state funds based on the current statutory formula has resulted in a failure to provide minimally adequate education to any child. Which of the following best describes the appropriate standard by which the court should review the constitutionality of the state statutory funding formula?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Because classifications based on wealth are inherently suspect, the state must demonstrate that the statutory formula is necessary to vindicate a compelling state interest.\nB. Because the statutory funding formula burdens the fundamental right to education, the state must demonstrate that the formula is necessary to vindicate a compelling state interest.\nC. Because no fundamental right or suspect classification is implicated in this case, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the funding allocation formula bears no rational relationship to any legitimate state interest.\nD.

In the last state legislative reapportionment, the board, by a unanimous vote, divided the greater metropolitan area, composed of a large city and several contiguous townships, into three equally populated state legislative districts. The result of that districting was that 40% of the area's total black population resided in one of those districts, 45% of the area's total black population resided in the second of those districts, and 15% resided in the third district. A registered voter, who is black and is a resident of the city, brings suit in an appropriate court against the members of the state reapportionment board, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that would require the boundary lines of the state legislative districts in the greater metropolitan area be redrawn. His only claim is that the current reapportionment violates the Fifteenth Amendment because it improperly dilutes the voting power of the blacks who reside in that area. If no federal statute is applicable, which of the following facts, if proven, would most strongly support the validity of the action of the state reapportionment board?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. In drawing the current district lines, the reapportionment board precisely complied with state constitutional requirements that state legislative districts be compact and follow political subdivision boundaries to the maximum extent feasible.\nB. The reapportionment board was composed of three white members and two black members and both of the board's black members were satisfied that its plan did not improperly dilute the voting power of the blacks who reside in that area.\nC. Although the rate of voter registration among blacks is below that of voter registrations among whites in the greater metropolitan area, two black legislators have been elected from that area during the last 15 years.\nD. The total black population of the greater metropolitan area amounts to only 15% of the population that is required to comprise a single legislative district.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The Fifteenth Amendment requires that each individual be counted equally for the purposes of voting and representation. However, as long as they retain a republican form of government, as required by Article IV, \u00a7 4 of the United States Constitution, the states are free to set their own rules for providing for representation of their citizens. So, if the state constitution requires that legislative districts be compact and follow political subdivision boundaries, the reapportionment board's actions would be valid since those requirements seem neutral.\n</s>"

After using various epithets and slurs to describe the occupants of these buildings, the building inspector stated to the reporter: \"I do not even try to get these buildings up to code or to have their owners prosecuted for code violations because if these buildings are repaired, the people who live in them will just wreck them again.\" The reporter published these statements in a story in the local newspaper. The building inspector admitted he made the statements. On the basis of these statements, the city council discharged the building inspector. Is the action of the city council constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the statements demonstrate that the building inspector has an attitude toward a certain class of persons that interferes with the proper performance of the obligations of his job.\nB. Yes, because the building inspector is a government employee and a person holding such a position may not make public comments inconsistent with current governmental policy.\nC. No, because the statements were lawful comments on a matter of public concern.\nD. No, because the statements were published in a newspaper that is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A public employee has a First Amendment right to speak on a matter of public concern, and may not be discharged for that speech unless the employee's actions interfere with the functions of the government. While the building inspector may have been speaking on a matter of public concern - enforcement of the building code and the state of low-income housing, which was the subject of a newspaper story - the statements demonstrated that the building inspector's attitude was interfering with his job, which was enforcement of the building code. Answer B is incorrect because government employees have a First Amendment right to comment publicly on matters of public concern. Answer C is incorrect because even when an employee's speech is on a matter of public concern, that employee may still be discharged if the employee's actions interfere with the functions of the government. Answer D is incorrect because the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect speech in newspapers.\n</s>"

Although the state insurance commissioner inspects insurance companies for solvency, the state does not regulate their rates or policies. An insurance company charges higher rates for burglary insurance to residents of one part of a county in the state than to residents of another section of the same county because of the different crime rates in those areas. The plaintiff is a resident of the county who was charged the higher rate by the insurance company because of the location of her residence. The plaintiff sues the insurance company, alleging that the differential in insurance rates unconstitutionally denies her the equal protection of the law. Will the plaintiff's suit succeed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the higher crime rate in the plaintiff's neighborhood demonstrates that the county police are not giving persons who reside there the equal protection of the laws.\nB.

A family are aliens who are permanent residents of the United States and have resided in the state for three years.

The plaintiff brought suit in federal district court against the police department and the city police officers involved, seeking only a judgment declaring unconstitutional the state statute under which the police acted. That newly enacted statute authorized the police to use deadly force when necessary to apprehend a person who has committed a felony. In his suit, the plaintiff alleged that the police would not have killed his friend if the use of deadly force had not been authorized by the statute. The federal district court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. decide the case on its merits, because it raises a substantial federal question.\nB. dismiss the action, because it involves a nonjusticiable political question.\nC. dismiss the action, because it does not present a case or controversy.\nD. dismiss the action, because the Eleventh Amendment prohibits federal courts from deciding cases of this type.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Article III limits the power of the federal judiciary to cases or controversies. Here, there is no case or controversy as these terms have been interpreted because the plaintiff has no standing. To have standing, a plaintiff: 1) must have suffered an injury, 2) the injury must have been caused by the action the plaintiff is challenging, and 3) it must be such that the injury can be redressed by the relief the plaintiff is seeking. Here, the plaintiff has not himself been injured, because his friend was the one shot and killed by police. That is not a close enough relationship for the law to recognize the loss as a legal injury. And, while the harm (the loss of his friend) was allegedly caused by the unconstitutional statute, his injury cannot be redressed by a declaration that the statute is unconstitutional. Declaratory actions are particularly prone to lack standing because they don't seek a more concrete remedy.\n</s>"

A federal statute provides that all liability of an interstate mover to a shipper for loss of or damage to the shipper's goods in transit is governed exclusively by the contract between them. The statute also requires the interstate carrier to offer a shipper at least two contracts with different levels of liability. In full compliance with that federal statute, the interstate carrier offered the shipper a choice between two shipping agreements that provided different levels of liability on the part of the interstate carrier. The less expensive contract limited the interstate carrier's liability in case of loss or damage to less than full value. The shipper voluntarily signed the less expensive contract with the the interstate carrier, fixing the interstate carrier's liability at less than the full value of the shipment. The interstate carrier's truck was involved in an accident in the state of Pink. The accident was entirely a product of the negligence of the interstate carrier's driver. The shipper's household goods were totally destroyed. In accordance with the contract, the interstate carrier reimbursed the shipper for less than the full value of the goods. The shipper then brought suit against the interstate carrier under the tort law of the state of Pink claiming that he was entitled to be reimbursed for the full value of the goods. The interstate carrier filed a motion to dismiss. In this suit, the court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. dismiss the case, because the federal statute governing liability of interstate carriers is the supreme law of the land and preempts state tort law.\nB. dismiss the case, because the contractual relationship between the shipper and the interstate carrier is governed by the obligation of contracts clause of the Constitution.\nC. deny the motion to dismiss, because the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution requires that state tort law be given effect.\nD. deny the motion to dismiss, because it is unconstitutional for a federal statute to authorize the interstate carrier to contract out of any degree of liability for its own negligence.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The supremacy clause provides that valid federal legislation supersedes conflicting state law.

The ordinance requires the operation of the city cemetery to be supported primarily by revenues derived from the sale of cemetery lots to individuals. The ordinance further provides that the purchase of a cemetery lot entitles the owner to perpetual care of the lot and entitles the owner to erect on the lot, at the owner's expense, a memorial monument or marker of the owner's choice, subject to certain size restrictions. The city ordinance requires the city to maintain the cemetery, including mowing the grass, watering flowers, and plowing snow, and provides for the expenditure of city tax funds for such maintenance if revenues from the sale of cemetery lots are insufficient. Although cemetery lots are sold at full fair market value, which includes the current value of perpetual care, the revenue from the sale of such lots has been insufficient in recent years to maintain the cemetery. As a result, a small amount of city tax funds has also been used for that purpose. A group of city taxpayers brings suit against the city challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance insofar as it permits the owner of a cemetery lot to erect a religious memorial monument or marker on his or her lot. Is this suit likely to be successful?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because only a small amount of city tax funds has been used to maintain the cemetery.\nB. No, because the purpose of the ordinance is entirely secular, its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and it does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.\nC. Yes, because city maintenance of any religious object is a violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because no compelling governmental interest justifies authorizing private persons to erect religious monuments or markers in a city-operated cemetery.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The test to analyze whether an ordinance violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment is 1) whether its purpose is secular, 2) whether its primary effect advances or inhibits religion, 3) and whether it fosters an excessive entanglement with religion. Since this ordinance's purpose is secular, its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion. And since it does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion, the ordinance does not violate the establishment clause. Answer A is incorrect because the amount of government support is irrelevant to an establishment clause analysis. Answer C is incorrect because merely tangential support of a religious object does not violate the establishment clause.

According to the rule, violators of the behavior code may be punished in a variety of ways including being required to sit in designated school confinement rooms during all school hours, with their hands clasped in front of them, for a period of up to 15 school days. A fifth grade student in the city's elementary school was charged with placing chewed bubble gum on a classmate's chair, a violation of the student behavior code. He had never violated the code before and was otherwise an attentive and well-behaved student. After a hearing on the charges, the student's principal determined that the student had violated the behavior code in the manner charged, and ordered the student to spend the next 15 school days in the school confinement room with his hands clasped in front of him. The student's parents filed suit in federal court challenging, solely on constitutional grounds, the principal's action in ordering the student to spend the next 15 school days in the school confinement room with his hands clasped in front of him. Which of the following arguments would be most helpful to the student's parents in this suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Because the school board rule limits the freedom of movement of students and subjects them to bodily restraint, it denies them a privilege and immunity of citizenship guaranteed them by Article IV, Section 2.\nB. Because the school board rule is substantially overbroad in relation to any legitimate purpose, it constitutes a facial violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. Because application of the school board rule in this case denies the student freedom of movement and subjects him to bodily restraint in a manner grossly disproportionate to his offense and circumstances, it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Because the school board rule is enforced initially by administrative rather than judicial proceedings, it constitutes a prohibited bill of attainder.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The best argument for the parents is that their son was deprived of liberty without due process of law.

Any state employee who is dismissed after that five-year period must be given reasons for the dismissal before it takes effect. In addition, such an employee must, upon request, be granted a post-dismissal hearing before an administrative board to seek reinstatement and back pay. The statute precludes any other hearing or opportunity to respond to the charges. That post-dismissal hearing must occur within six months after the dismissal takes effect. The burden of proof at such a hearing is on the state, and the board may uphold the dismissal only if it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. An employee who is dissatisfied with a decision of the board after a hearing may appeal its decision to the state courts. The provisions of this statute are inseverable. A teacher who had been employed continuously for seven years as a faculty member at the state university was dismissed. A week before the dismissal took effect, she was informed that she was being dismissed because of a charge that she accepted a bribe from a student in return for raising the student's final grade in her course. At that time she requested an immediate hearing to contest the propriety of her dismissal. Three months after her dismissal, she was granted a hearing before the state administrative board. The board upheld her dismissal, finding that the charge against her was supported by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing. The faculty member did not appeal the decision of the state administrative board to the state courts. Instead, she sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court to the effect that the state statute prescribing the procedures for her dismissal is unconstitutional. In this case, the federal district court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. dismiss the suit, because a claim that a state statute is unconstitutional is not ripe for adjudication by a federal court until all judicial remedies in state courts provided for by state law have been exhausted.\nB. hold the statute unconstitutional because the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt the facts constituting good cause for termination of a state employee.\nC. hold the statute unconstitutional, because a state may not ordinarily deprive an employee of a property interest in a job without giving the employee an opportunity for some kind of a predismissal hearing to respond to the charges against that employee.\nD. hold the statute constitutional, because the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment entitles state employees who have a right to their jobs during good behavior only to a statement of reasons for their dismissal and an opportunity for a post-dismissal hearing.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The state law gives this employee a property right in her job, and ordinarily, such a right in a job may not be taken away without a pre-termination hearing. Accordingly, the district court should hold the statute unconstitutional. A is not correct because the controversy is ripe. A controversy is not ripe when an injury is anticipated but has not yet occurred. The teacher has been injured by being terminated, so her controversy is ripe. She need not wait for the state to fail to correct her termination. B is not correct because the due process clause does not require the state to prove that there is good cause beyond a reasonable doubt. Answer D is not correct because state employment is considered an important enough property right to require a pre-dismissal hearing.\n</s>"

The state statute\nAnswer Choices:\nA. deprives them of their property or liberty without due process of law.\nB. imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.\nC. deprives them of a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.\nD. denies them the equal protection of the laws.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The strongest argument for the manufacturers and wholesalers is that regulating their prices relative to the prices they charge in other states unreasonably burdens interstate commerce.

Choice C is incorrect because the state statute does not classify on the basis of residence. In-state manufacturers and wholesalers are treated identically to those out-of-state. Finally, choice D is incorrect because there is no classification here, and thus, the statute need only be rationally related to some conceivable legitimate state interest.

The appropriation statute providing the money for construction of the new heating system permitted use of the old, pollution-generating system when necessary to supply additional heat. When the old heating system operates (only about two days in any year), the smokestack of the building emits smoke that exceeds the state's pollution-control standards. May the operators of the federal office building be prosecuted successfully by state authorities for violating that state's pollution control standards?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the regulation of pollution is a legitimate state police power concern.\nB. Yes, because the regulation of pollution is a joint concern of the federal government and the state and, therefore, both of them may regulate conduct causing pollution.\nC. No, because the operations of the federal government are immune from state regulation in the absence of federal consent.\nD. No, because the violations of the state pollution-control standards involved here are so de minimis that they are beyond the legitimate reach of state law.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Under the supremacy clause, the state cannot regulate the federal government without the federal government's consent. Choice A is incorrect because even though the state has a legitimate interest in regulating pollution, and such regulation is within the state's police power, the state lacks the power to control the federal government. Choice B is incorrect for the same reason. Although the proposition it states is correct, the state simply cannot control the federal government. Choice D is incorrect because the state can regulate de minimus violations of its pollution control standards when those violations are committed by private parties. It can't regulate the federal government, however.\n</s>"

So long as it complies with this requirement, a company is free to charge whatever rate the market will bear for its burglary insurance policies. An insurance company located in the state files suit in federal district court against appropriate state officials to challenge this statute on constitutional grounds. The insurance company wishes to charge customers residing within the same county in the state rates for burglary insurance policies that will vary because they would be based on the specific nature of the customer's business, on its precise location, and on its past claims. In this suit, the court should \nAnswer Choices:\nA. hold the statute unconstitutional, because the statute deprives the insurance company of its liberty or property without due process of law.\nB. hold the statute unconstitutional, because the statute imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. hold the statute constitutional, because the statute is a reasonable exercise of the state's police power.\nD. abstain from ruling on the merits of this case until the state courts have had an opportunity to pass on the constitutionality of this state statute.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The state has a legitimate interest in regulating the sale of insurance. And, because the limit the state puts on insurance companies is uniform and is very small, (that it must charge a uniform rate to all customers within the same county but may charge whatever rate that the market will bear), that limit is reasonable. Therefore, it is constitutional. A is incorrect because the state has not substantially interfered with the use of any insurance company property. B is incorrect because the treatment of all insurance companies is uniform. D is incorrect because there is no reason to abstain. This is not a situation in which the meaning of the state statute is unsettled, or that involves an area that is so fully regulated by the state that the federal court, in the interest of good relations would abstain.\n</s>"

At the time widgets are manufactured and taxed they have not yet entered the channels of interstate commerce.\nB. The economic impact of this tax will be passed on to both in-state and out-of-state purchasers of widgets and, therefore, it is wholly nondiscriminatory in its effect.\nC.

These residents are evenly distributed among the many different residential areas of the city. The five city council members of Green City are elected from five single-member electoral districts that are nearly equally populated. No candidate has ever been elected to the city council who was a member of a minority racial group. A group of citizens who are members of minority racial groups file suit in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that the single-member districts in Green City are unconstitutional. They claim that the city diminishes the ability of voters who are members of minority racial groups to affect the outcome of the city elections. They seek an order from the court forcing the city to adopt an at-large election system in which the five candidates with the greatest vote totals would be elected to the city council. No state or federal statutes are applicable to the resolution of this suit.

A is not correct because the Thirteenth Amendment abolishes slavery. And, while the inability to vote is a badge of slavery, the Thirteenth Amendment does not focus on the vote per se.

A measure that appears to be revenue raising on its face is not invalid merely because it may have adverse economic consequences for the activity being taxed. A is not correct because tax measures need not satisfy strict scrutiny. Answer C is not correct because the potential impact on attendance at sporting events does not defeat the rational relationship between the taxing and reducing the deficit. D is incorrect because a taxing provision needs to be only minimally rational to satisfy the Equal Protection Clause. It is irrelevant that championship events are singled out for taxation.\n</s>"

After a heated political debate in the legislature, the state enacted legislation providing for a one-time grant of $10 million in state funds to the baseball team to cover part of the projected income losses the team would suffer during the next five years if it remained in that state. The legislation required that the team remain in the state for at least ten years if it accepted the grant. After accepting the grant, the owners of the baseball team decided to build a new $150 million stadium in the state. As plans for the construction of the new stadium proceeded, it became evident that all of the contractors and subcontractors would be white males, and that they had been chosen by the owners of the baseball team without public bids because these contractors and subcontractors had successfully built the only other new baseball stadium in the region. Several contractors who were females or members of minority racial groups filed suit against the owners of the the baseball team in federal district court to compel public solicitation of bids for the construction of its new stadium on an equal opportunity basis, and to enjoin construction of the stadium until compliance was ensured. Their only claim was that the contracting practices of the owners of the baseball team denied them the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this suit, the court will probably rule that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the nexus between the actions of the owners of the baseball team and the one-time grant of monies to them by the state is sufficiently substantial to subject their actions to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. the intense public preoccupation with the activities of major league baseball teams coupled with the fact that baseball is considered to be our national pastime is sufficient to justify application of the Fourteenth Amendment to the activities of major league teams.\nC. in the absence of additional evidence of state involvement in the operations or decisions of the owners of the baseball team, a one-time grant of state monies to them is insufficient to warrant treating their actions as subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. the issues presented by this case are nonjusticiable political questions because there is a lack of judicially manageable standards to resolve them and they are likely to be deeply involved in partisan politics.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The Fourteenth Amendment only limits the power of states and state actors. The baseball franchise is a private entity, and the Fourteenth Amendment cannot reach it unless somehow it has become a state actor. The franchise can only be a state actor if it performs some traditional governmental function or if the government has become very involved in the management of the franchise. The grant of money by itself is not enough involvement, so choice A is incorrect. Therefore, the court will probably rule that the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply. Choice B is incorrect because public preoccupation with baseball and its designation as the national pastime are not enough to make baseball a traditionally governmental function. Choice D is incorrect because this does not present a political question. There are two real sides with something at stake, and the controversy is concrete enough to be justiciable.\n</s>"

The statute imposes an undue burden on foreign commerce.\nB. The statute denies the owners of foreign-made automobiles the equal protection of the laws.\nC.

The statute is inconsistent with the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Congress has the sole power to regulate the trade between the United States and foreign governments. This power is similar to the internal commerce power. Because there is an effect on owners of automobiles manufactured outside of the United States, there is some effect on foreign commerce. Therefore, the state's action interferes with Congress' power in this area. This is sometimes known as the \"dormant\" commerce clause. B is incorrect because it is not very strong. Since the statute does not classify using any suspect class, only rational basis review would be applied, and statutes are almost never struck down on rational basis review. C is incorrect because ownership of a foreign car is not a fundamental liberty or property interest, and therefore, rational basis review would apply.

After substantial property damage was inflicted on residents of a particular state by hungry coyotes, the state legislature passed the Coyote Bounty Bill, which offers $25 for each coyote killed or captured within the state. A national forest, owned by the federal government, is located entirely within the state. Many coyotes live in this national forest.

That law exempted from its provisions the sale of \"all magazines, periodicals, newspapers, and books.\" In order to raise additional revenue, the state legislature eliminated that broad exemption and substituted a narrower exemption. The new, narrower exemption excluded from the state sales tax only the sale of those \"magazines, periodicals, newspapers, and books that are published or distributed by a recognized religious faith and that consist wholly of writings sacred to such a religious faith.\" One magazine is a monthly publication devoted to history and politics. The magazine paid under protest the sales tax due on its sales according to the amended sales tax law. The magazine then filed suit against the state in an appropriate state court for a refund of the sales taxes paid. It contended that the state's elimination of the earlier, broader exemption and adoption of the new, narrower exemption restricted to sacred writings of recognized religious faiths violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. In this case, the court will probably rule that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the magazine lacks standing to sue for a refund of sales taxes imposed by a generally applicable state law because Article III of the Constitution precludes taxpayers from bringing such suits.\nB. the Eleventh Amendment bars the state court from exercising jurisdiction over this suit in the absence of a law of the state expressly waiving the state's immunity.\nC. the new, narrower exemption from the state sales tax law violates the establishment clause of the First and Fourteenth Amendments by granting preferential state support to recognized religious faiths for the communication of their religious beliefs.\nD. the new, narrower exemption from the state sales tax law violates the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it imposes a prior restraint on nonreligious publications that are required to pay the tax.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The test to analyze whether a law violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment is 1) whether its purpose is secular, 2) whether its primary effect advances or inhibits religion, 3) and whether it fosters an excessive entanglement with religion. The new sales tax exemption gives a benefit only to \"recognized religious faiths\" and only for the publication of their sacred writings. That exemption is effectively a subsidy of recognized religious faiths. While the tax may have a secular purpose and the advancement of religion is not its primary effect, the tax is an excessive entanglement with religion.

This federal statute also required the new state to write those exact same conditions into its state constitution. One hundred years later, a statute of the state dealing with the sale of these public lands was challenged in a state court lawsuit on the ground that it was inconsistent with the conditions contained in the federal statute, and with the provisions of the state constitution that exactly copy the conditions contained in the federal statute. The trial court decision in this case was appealed to the state supreme court. In its opinion, the state supreme court dealt at length with the ambiguous language of the federal statute and with cases interpreting identical language in federal statutes admitting other states to the union. The state supreme court opinion did not discuss the similar provisions of the state constitution, but it did hold that the challenged state statute is invalid because it is \"inconsistent with the language of the federal statute and therefore is inconsistent with the identical provisions of our state constitution.\" If the losing party in the state supreme court seeks review of the decision of that court in the United States Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. accept the case for review and determine the validity and interpretation of the federal statute if it is an important and substantial question.\nB. ask the state supreme court to indicate more clearly whether it relied on the state constitutional provision in rendering its decision.\nC. decline to review the case on the ground that the decision of the state supreme court rests on an adequate and independent state ground.\nD. decline to review the case because a decision by a state supreme court concerning the proper disposition of state public lands is not reviewable by the United States Supreme Court.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The Supreme Court should accept the case for review and determine the validity and interpretation of the federal statute if it is an important federal question. The Supreme Court may not review the state supreme court's interpretation of its own state constitution, but here, the state supreme court rested its decision on its interpretation of federal law. Its comment that the decision also comported with its state constitution was not an \"adequate and independent\" state ground that would cause the Court not to review the case. B is incorrect because asking the state Supreme Court for clarification would be completely unnecessary in this case, since the state constitution is identical to the federal statute. C is incorrect because the state constitution did not provide an adequate and independent state ground for the decision.

The members of this group meet once a year on top of Mt. Snow, located in a U.S. National Park, to hold an overnight encampment and a midnight dance around a large campfire. They believe this overnight encampment and all of its rituals are required by Lucifer to be held on top of Mt. Snow. U.S. National Park Service rules that have been consistently enforced prohibit all overnight camping and all campfires on Mt. Snow because of the very great dangers overnight camping and campfires would pose in that particular location. As a result, the park Superintendent denied a request by the Friends of Lucifer for a permit to conduct these activities on top of Mt. Snow. The park Superintendent, who was known to be violently opposed to cults and other unconventional groups had, in the past, issued permits to conventional religious groups to conduct sunrise services in other areas of that U.S. National Park. The Friends of Lucifer brought suit in Federal Court against the U.S. National Park Service and the Superintendent of the park to compel issuance of the requested permit. As a matter of constitutional law, the most appropriate result in this suit would be a decision that denial of the permit was\nAnswer Choices:\nA. invalid, because the free exercise clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Park Service from knowingly interfering with religious conduct.\nB. invalid, because these facts demonstrate that the action of the Park Service purposefully and invidiously discriminated against the Friends of Lucifer.\nC. valid, because the establishment clause of the First Amendment prohibits the holding of religious ceremonies on federal land.\nD. valid, because religiously motivated conduct may be subjected to nondiscriminatory time, place, and manner restrictions that advance important public interests.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The government may regulate the time, place, and manner of religiously motivated conduct as long as the regulation is neutral and serves an important public interest. Here, the regulation is neutral on its face and it is neutrally applied, the Superintendent's views notwithstanding. The interest of public safety is important. Therefore the denial of the permit would be valid. A is incorrect because the permit rules do not target religious practices. B is incorrect because these facts do not demonstrate purposeful and invidious discrimination against the Friends of Lucifer. No group has been allowed to camp all night or to light campfires on Mt. Snow. C is incorrect because the establishment clause does not prohibit the holding of religious ceremonies on public land as long as those ceremonies do not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.\n</s>"

They threatened to kill her unless the President of the United States secured the release of an identified person who was a citizen of that country and was held in a prison in State A in the United States pursuant to a valid conviction by that state. The President responded by entering into an agreement with the foreign country which provided that the country would secure the release of the United States ambassador on a specified date in return for action by the President that would secure the release of the identified person held in the state prison. The President then ordered the governor of the state to release the prisoner in question. The governor refused. No federal statutes are applicable. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument for the authority of the President to take action in these circumstances requiring the governor of the state to release the state prisoner?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The statute provides that \"the ten best universities in the United States\" will each receive $10 million. It also provides that \"the ten best universities\" shall be \"determined by a poll of the presidents of all the universities in the nation, to be conducted by the United States Department of Education.\" In responding to that poll, each university president is required to apply the well-recognized and generally accepted standards of academic quality that are specified in the statute. The provisions of the statute are inseverable. Which of the following statements about this statute is correct?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The statute is unconstitutional, because the reliance by Congress on a poll of individuals who are not federal officials to determine the recipients of its appropriated funds is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.\nB. The statute is unconstitutional, because the limitation on recipients to the ten best universities is arbitrary and capricious and denies other high quality universities the equal protection of the laws.\nC.

A is incorrect because Congress's creation of a polling system to allocate the funds is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The statute limits the discretion of the university presidents to specific well-recognized and generally accepted standards of academic quality, and so the power granted to the university presidents is very narrow. B is incorrect because limiting the funding to the ten best universities is a reasonable line to have drawn, given the fact that the funds are limited. D is incorrect because the validity of a statute will nearly always be justiciable and not a political question. This statute is not the type of action and is not on a subject that is clearly committed to the sole discretion of Congress by the Constitution, and ruling on the validity of a statute provides judicially manageable standards.\n</s>"

As part of that program, the state limits, by statute, oyster fishing in its coastal waters to persons who have state oyster permits. In order to promote conservation, it issues only a limited number of oyster permits each year. The permits are effective for only one year from the date of their issuance and are awarded on the basis of lottery, in which there is no differentiation between resident and nonresident applicants. However, each nonresident who obtains a permit is charged an annual permit fee that is $5 more than the fee charged residents. A large fishing company operates from a port in another state and is incorporated in that other state. Each of the boats of the fishing company has a federal shipping license that permits it \"to engage in all aspects of the coastal trade, to fish and to carry cargo from place to place along the coast, and to engage in other lawful activities along the coast of the United States.\" These shipping licenses are authorized by federal statute. Assume no other federal statutes or administrative rules apply. Although it had previously held a State A oyster permit, the fishing company did not obtain a permit in that state's lottery this year. Which of the following is the strongest argument that can be made in support of a continued right of the fishing company to fish for oysters this year in the coastal waters of State A?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Because the state law provides higher permit charges for nonresidents, it is an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nB. Because the state law provides higher permit charges for nonresidents, it denies the fishing company the privileges and immunities of state citizenship.\nC. Because it holds a federal shipping license, the fishing company has a right to fish for oysters in state waters despite the state law.\nD. Because the fishing company previously held a State A oyster permit and the state knows that the company is engaged in a continuing business operation, the refusal to grant the fishing company a permit this year is a taking of its property without due process of law.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Because the supremacy clause provides that valid federal laws supersede conflicting state laws, the strongest argument for the fishing company to continue to fish for oysters is that it has a federal shipping license that allows it to fish for oysters. A is incorrect because the fishing company was denied a state permit. So the higher rate for permit charges is irrelevant to the fishing company which was denied the permit entirely. For similar reasons, B is incorrect. Additionally, the Privileges and Immunities Clause does not apply to corporations, but only to individuals. Even if the different rates charged to non-residents were to violate the privileges and immunities clause, that is not relevant to the fishing company which was denied the license entirely. Finally, D is incorrect because the permit is a property right which only lasts one year, and so there was no lasting property that the state could have taken.\n</s>"

The concessionaire operated his concession stand out of the federally owned facilities in the park. The federal statute authorizing the Interior Department to grant such concession stands provided that the grantees would pay only a nominal rental fee for use of these federal facilities because of the great benefit their concession stands would provide to the people of the United States. The legislature of the state enacted a statute imposing an occupancy tax on the occupants of real estate within that state that is not subject to state real estate taxes. The statute was intended to equalize the state tax burden on such occupants with that of people occupying real estate that is subject to state real estate taxes. Pursuant to that statute, the state Department of Revenue attempted to collect the state occupancy tax from the concessionaire because the federal facilities occupied by the concessionaire were not subject to state real estate taxes. The concessionaire sued to invalidate the state occupancy tax as applied to him.

A candidate, who is thinking about running for mayor in an election that will take place next year, will have been a resident of the city for only four and one-half years at the time the mayor elected then takes office. Before he decides whether to run for the position of mayor, the candidate wants to know whether he could lawfully assume that position if he were elected. As a result, the candidate files suit in the local federal district court for a declaratory judgment that the city's five-year-residence requirement is unconstitutional and that he is entitled to a place on his political party's primary election ballot for mayor. He names the chairman of his political party as the sole defendant but does not join any election official. The chairman responds by joining the candidate in requesting the court to declare the city's residence requirement invalid. In this case, the court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. refuse to determine the merits of this suit, because there is no case or controversy.\nB. refuse to issue such a declaratory judgment, because an issue of this kind involving only a local election does not present a substantial federal constitutional question.\nC. issue the declaratory judgment, because a residency requirement of this type is a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\nD. issue the declaratory judgment, because the candidate will have substantially complied with the residency requirement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n There is no case or controversy here because the candidate lacks standing. One reason he lacks standing is that the issue is not yet ripe for review. The issue is not ripe because the candidate will not suffer an injury until he is barred from running for office or until he has won the election. At that point, an injury will either have occurred or will be so certain to occur as to confer standing. The second reason the candidate lacks standing is that the candidate has not joined the correct party to provide him the relief that will redress the injury. The chairman of his local political party would be the correct party to sue if the political party refuses to put him on the ballot due to the residency requirement. However, the candidate seems to be challenging the qualifications with the assumption that he will not be allowed to take office. The correct defendant would be whichever official enforces those qualifications and determines whether elected officials take office, presumably election officials. Finally, the mere agreement by the parties that the court should consider the issue is irrelevant; standing cannot be created by agreement.\n</s>"

In order to help students who keep their babies to complete high school, the local high school has established an infant day-care center for children of its students and also offers classes in childcare. Because the childcare classes are always overcrowded, the school limits admission to those classes solely to the high school students who are mothers of babies in the infant day-care center. A student at the high school has legal custody of his infant son. The school provides care for his son in its infant day-care center but will not allow him to enroll in the childcare classes. He brings suit against the school challenging, on constitutional grounds, his exclusion from the childcare classes. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this case?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The student must demonstrate that the admission requirement is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\nB. The student must demonstrate that the admission requirement is not as narrowly drawn as possible to achieve a substantial governmental interest.\nC.

A citizen of the state was in her second month of pregnancy. She sought an abortion at the State Hospital, a state-owned and state-operated facility. The citizen did not claim that the requested abortion was necessary to save her life. The officials in charge of the hospital refused to perform the requested abortion solely on the basis of the state statute. The citizen immediately filed suit against those officials in an appropriate federal district court. She challenged the constitutionality of the state statute and requested the court to order the hospital to perform the abortion she sought.

A state statute requires occupants of residences with basements susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences tested for the presence of radon and to take specified remedial steps if the test indicates the presence of radon above specified levels. The statute also provides that the testing for radon may be done only by testers licensed by a state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards relating to the accuracy of its testing. These standards may easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology required to meet them is 50% more expensive than the technology required to measure radon accumulations in a slightly less accurate manner. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not license radon testers. However, a federal statute authorizes the EPA to advise on the accuracy of various methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably accurate. A recently established state firm uses a testing method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. The firm is also included by the EPA on a list of testers using methods of testing it believes to be reasonably accurate. The firm applies for a state radon testing license, but its application is denied because the firm cannot demonstrate that the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate to meet the rigorous state statutory standards. The firm sues appropriate state officials in federal court claiming that the state may not constitutionally exclude the firm from performing the required radon tests in the state. In this suit, the court will probably rule in favor of\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the firm, because the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution requires the state to respect and give effect to the action of the EPA in including the firm on its list of testers that use reasonably accurate methods.\nB. the firm, because the supremacy clause of the Constitution requires the state to respect and give effect to the action of the EPA in including the firm on its list of testers that use reasonably accurate methods.\nC. The state, because the federal statute and the action of the EPA in including the firm on its list of testers that use reasonably accurate methods are not inconsistent with the more rigorous state licensing requirement, and that requirement is reasonably related to a legitimate public interest.\nD.

A power company, a public utility regulated by that commission, has just obtained approval of the commission for a general rate increase. The power company has routinely filed for a rate increase every ten to 14 months during the last 20 years. Because of uncertainties about future fuel prices, the power company cannot ascertain with any certainty the date when it will need a further rate increase; but it thinks it may need such an increase sometime within the next 18 months. The power company files an action in the federal district court in the state requesting a declaratory judgment that this new state statute forbidding public utility rate increases more often than once every two years is unconstitutional. Assume no federal statute is relevant. In this case, the court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. hold the statute unconstitutional, because such a moratorium on rate increases deprives utilities of their property without due process of law.\nB. hold the statute constitutional, because the judgment of a legislature on a matter involving economic regulation is entitled to great deference.\nC. dismiss the complaint, because this action is not ripe for decision.\nD. dismiss the complaint, because controversies over state-regulated utility rates are outside of the jurisdiction conferred on federal courts by Article III of the Constitution.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n There is no injury yet to the power company.

The clerk has been responsible for copying and filing records of real estate transactions in that office. The clerk works in a nonpublic part of the office and has no contact with members of the public. However, state law provides that all real estate records in that office are to be made available for public inspection. On the day an attempted assassination of the governor of the state was reported on the radio, the clerk remarked to a coworker, \"Our governor is such an evil man, I am sorry they did not get him.\" The clerk's coworker reported this remark to the clerk's employer, the county recorder. After the clerk admitted to making the remark, the county recorder dismissed him stating that \"there is no room in this office for a person who hates the governor so much.\" The clerk sued for reinstatement and back pay. His only claim is that the dismissal violated his constitutional rights. In this case, the court should hold that the county recorder's dismissal of the clerk was\nAnswer Choices:\nA. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a taking without just compensation of the clerk's property interest in his permanent position with the county.\nB. unconstitutional, because in light of the clerk's particular employment duties his right to express himself on a matter of public concern outweighed any legitimate interest the state might have had in discharging him.\nC. constitutional, because the compelling interest of the state in having loyal and supportive employees outweighs the interest of any state employee in his or her job or in free speech on a matter of public concern.\nD. no justiciable, because public employment is a privilege rather than a right and, therefore, the clerk lacked standing to bring this suit.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Public employees have the right under the First Amendment to express their views on issues of public concern. The statement in this case, on the merits of the governor were clearly on a matter of public concern. The First Amendment requires that when a public employee engages in protected speech, the employer may not discharge the employee unless the statements impair that employee's ability to do the job. The court weighs the interests of the employer in fulfilling its duties against the interests of the employee speaking as a private citizen. Here, the employee's comments had nothing to do with his job of copying and filing real estate records, and could not be said to have interfered with his duties. Additionally, because he had no duties to interact with the public, any notoriety he gained or public disruption would not affect his ability to do his job. Therefore, the court should hold that his termination was unconstitutional.\n</s>"

The ordinance was intended to protect surrounding property from the likely adverse secondary effects of such establishments. \"Adult theaters and bookstores\" are freely permitted in the areas of the city zoned industrial, where those adverse secondary effects are not as likely. A storekeeper is denied a zoning permit to open an adult theater and bookstore in a building owned by him in an area zoned commercial. As a result, the storekeeper brings suit in an appropriate court challenging the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance. Which of the following statements regarding the constitutionality of this ordinance is most accurate?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The ordinance is valid, because a city may enforce zoning restrictions on speech-related businesses to ensure that the messages they disseminate are acceptable to the residents of adjacent property.\nB. The ordinance is valid, because a city may enforce this type of time, place, and manner regulation on speech-related businesses, so long as this type of regulation is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.\nC. The ordinance is invalid, because a city may not enforce zoning regulations that deprive potential operators of adult theatres and bookstores of their freedom to choose the location of their businesses.\nD. The ordinance is invalid, because a city may not zone property in a manner calculated to protect property from the likely adverse secondary effects of adult theaters and bookstores.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The city here is not prohibiting a particular type of speech entirely. Rather it is regulating where that \"speech\" may take place. And, the test for evaluating time, place, and manner restrictions is whether the restriction is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest in a way that does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication. Preventing adverse secondary effects associated with adult theaters and bookstores is a substantial governmental interest.\n</s>"

The County Tax Commission, in making its assessments, has uniformly and consistently determined the \"actual value\" of real property solely by reference to the price at which the particular property was last sold. In recent years, the market values of real property in the county have been rising at the rate of 15% per year. A homeowner is required to pay real estate taxes on her home in the county that are 200% to 300% higher than those paid by many other owners of similar homes in similar neighborhoods in that county, even though the current market values of their respective homes and the homeowner's home are nearly identical. The reason the taxes on the homeowner's home are higher than those imposed on the other similar homes in similar neighborhoods is that she bought her home much more recently than the other owners and, therefore, it is assessed at a much higher \"actual value\" than their homes. Persistent efforts by the homeowner to have her assessment reduced or the assessments of the others raised by the County Tax Commission have failed. The homeowner has now filed suit against the County Tax Commission, charging only that the tax assessment on her property is unconstitutional. The strongest constitutional argument to support the homeowner's claim is that the comparative overvaluation of the homeowner's property by the County Tax Commission in making tax assessments over time\nAnswer Choices:\nA. deprives the homeowner of the equal protection of the laws.\nB. deprives the homeowner of a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.\nC. constitutes a taking of private property for public use without just compensation.\nD. constitutes an ex post facto law.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The ground for the homeowner's complaint is that her taxes are higher than the taxes paid by other owners of similar homes. Because she is protesting the way that the government is treating her compared to people she claims are similarly situated, she is making an equal protection challenge. B is incorrect because the privileges and immunities clause only prohibits states from treating out of state residents differently than state residents. Here, there is no classification of non-residents. C is incorrect because taxation is almost never a taking of property for public use. D is incorrect because the law is not a new enactment that makes illegal something that was legal when it happened. Therefore, equal protection is really the only valid claim the owner can make.\n</s>"

The presence of those parasites threatens the health of organisms living in rivers and streams throughout the country and imperils the freshwater commercial fishing industry. The mineral is currently mined only in one particular state. In order to raise needed revenue, Congress recently enacted a statute providing for the imposition of a $100 tax on each ton of the mineral that is mined in the United States. Because it will raise the cost of the mineral, this tax is likely to reduce the amount of the mineral that is added to freshwater rivers and streams and, therefore, is likely to have an adverse effect on the interstate freshwater commercial fishing industry. The mineral producers in the state have filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging this tax solely on constitutional grounds. Is this tax constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because only producers in the state will pay the tax and, therefore, it is not uniform among the states and denies mineral producers the equal protection of the laws.\nB. No, because it is likely to have an adverse effect on the freshwater commercial fishing industry and Congress has a responsibility under the clause to protect, foster, and advance such interstate industries.\nC. Yes, because the tax is a necessary and proper means of exercising federal authority over the navigable waters of the United States.\nD. Yes, because the power of Congress to impose taxes is plenary, this tax does not contain any provisions extraneous to tax needs or purposes, and it is not barred by any prohibitory language in the Constitution.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Congress's power to tax is plenary, and this statute does not contain provisions extraneous to tax purposes, and it does not violate any other section of the Constitution. A is incorrect because the tax does not make any irrational classification. The tax is limited to one product, and while the product is mined only in one state, residents of other states could be doing the mining. The tax's limitation to one subject is not irrational and is therefore constitutional.\n</s>"

The district was created solely to supply water to an entirely new community in a recently developed area of the state. That new community is racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse, and the community has never engaged in any discrimination against members of minority groups. The five-member, elected governing board of the newly created district contains two persons who are members of racial minority groups. At its first meeting, the governing board of the district adopted a rule unqualifiedly setting aside 25% of all positions on the staff of the district and 25% of all contracts to be awarded by the district to members of racial minority groups. The purpose of the rule was \"to help redress the historical discrimination against these groups in this country and to help them achieve economic parity with other groups in our society.\" Assume that no federal statute applies. A suit by appropriate parties challenges the constitutionality of these set-asides. In this suit, the most appropriate ruling on the basis of applicable United States Supreme Court precedent would be that the set-asides are\nAnswer Choices:\nA. unconstitutional, because they would deny other potential employees or potential contractors the equal protection of the laws.\nB. unconstitutional, because they would impermissibly impair the right to contract of other potential employees or potential contractors.\nC. constitutional, because they would assure members of racial minority groups the equal protection of the laws.\nD. constitutional, because the function and activities of the district are of a proprietary nature rather than a governmental nature and, therefore, are not subject to the usual requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The set-asides classify on the basis of race, and therefore, must pass strict scrutiny; they must serve a compelling governmental interest and use the least restrictive means possible. The Supreme Court has recognized that remedying past discrimination is a compelling governmental interest. Here, there is no compelling governmental interest because there has been no history of discrimination, the community is diverse, and forty percent of the members of the governing board are members of racial minorities. Without this, the set-asides are unconstitutional discrimination against members of the majority race in violation of equal protection.\n</s>"

This federal statute is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. unconstitutional, because Congress has no authority to require a state legislature to enact any specified legislation.\nB. unconstitutional, because the possession, use, or distribution, in close proximity to a school, of a controlled substance that has previously been transported in interstate commerce does not have a sufficiently close nexus to such commerce to justify its regulation by Congress.\nC. constitutional, because it contains a jurisdictional provision that will ensure, on a case-by-case basis, that any particular controlled substance subject to the terms of this statute will, in fact, affect interstate commerce.\nD. constitutional, because Congress possesses broad authority under both the general welfare clause and the commerce clause to regulate any activities affecting education that also have, in inseverable aggregates, a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Congress has no authority to require a state legislature to enact any specified legislation except when it is acting under its spending power. This is not a spending provision, so Congress cannot make the states enact these laws. B is incorrect because the statute only applies to drugs that were transported in interstate commerce. Moreover, controlled substances, whether legal or illegal, are probably part of the stream of commerce, and Congress can probably regulate them under its commerce clause power.\n</s>"

The purpose of this statute is to protect these persons from further publicity or embarrassment relating to those state proceedings. However, this statute does not prohibit the publication of such information that is in the possession of private persons A prominent businessman in the state was arrested and charged with rape. Prior to trial, the prosecutor announced that new information indicated that the charges should be dropped. He then dropped the charges without further explanation, and the records relating thereto were closed to the public pursuant to the state statute. The newspaper in the state conducted an investigation to determine why the businessman was not prosecuted, but was refused access to the closed official state records. In an effort to determine whether the law enforcement agencies involved were properly doing their duty, the newspaper filed suit against appropriate state officials to force opening of the records and to invalidate the statute on constitutional grounds.

The fact that the statute treats in an identical manner the arrest and prosecution records of all persons who have been acquitted of a crime by a court or against whom criminal charges were filed and subsequently dropped or dismissed.\nB. The argument that the rights of the press are no greater than those of citizens generally.\nC.

The communities located in Kelly County are principally suburbs of Scarletville, a large city located in State B, and therefore there is a large volume of traffic between that city and Kelly County. While most of that traffic is by private passenger automobiles, some of it is by taxicabs and other kinds of commercial vehicles.An ordinance of Kelly County, the stated purpose of which is to reduce traffic congestion, provides that only taxicabs registered in Kelly County may pick up or discharge passengers in the county. The ordinance also provides that only residents of Kelly County may register taxicabs in that county. Which of the following is the proper result in a suit brought by Scarletville taxicab owners challenging the constitutionality of this Kelly County ordinance?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Judgment for Scarletville taxicab owners, because the fact that private passenger automobiles contribute more to the traffic congestion problem in Kelly County than do taxicabs indicates that the ordinance is not a reasonable means by which to solve that problem.\nB. Judgment for Scarletville taxicab owners, because the ordinance unduly burdens interstate commerce by insulating Kelly County taxicab owners from out-of-state competition without adequate justification.\nC. Judgment for Kelly County, because the ordinance forbids taxicabs registered in other counties of State A as well as in states other than State A to operate in Kelly County and, therefore, it does not discriminate against interstate commerce.\nD.

The ordinance effectively gives Kelly residents a monopoly over the taxicab business in the guise of reducing congestion. This monopoly burdens interstate commerce, and because there is no limit on the number of taxicabs that can be registered, it is difficult to see how the ordinance will reduce congestion.

The ordinance states that the sole criteria for the issuance of such a license are driving ability and knowledge of the geography of the city. An applicant is tested by the city for these qualifications with a detailed questionnaire, written and oral examinations, and a practical behind-the-wheel demonstration. The ordinance does not limit the number of licenses that may be issued. It does, however, allow any citizen to file an objection to the issuance of a particular license, but only on the ground that an applicant does not possess the required qualifications. City licensing officials are also authorized by the ordinance to determine, in their discretion, whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on an objection before issuing a license. A woman applies for a taxicab operator's license and is found to be fully qualified after completing the usual licensing process. Her name is then posted as a prospective licensee, subject only to the objection process. A licensed taxicab driver files an objection to the issuance of such a license to the woman solely on the ground that the grant of a license to the woman would impair the value of the licensed driver's existing license. The licensed driver demands a hearing before a license is issued to the woman so that he may have an opportunity to prove his claim. City licensing officials refuse to hold such a hearing, and they issue a license to the woman. The licensed driver petitions for review of this action by city officials in an appropriate court, alleging that the Constitution requires city licensing officials to grant his request for a hearing before issuing a license to the woman. In this case, the court should rule for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the licensed driver, because the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires all persons whose property may be adversely affected by governmental action to be given an opportunity for a hearing before such action occurs.\nB. the licensed driver, because the determination of whether to hold a hearing may not constitutionally be left to the discretion of the same officials whose action is being challenged.\nC. city officials, because the licensed driver had the benefit of the licensing ordinance and, therefore may not now question actions taken under it.\nD. city officials, because the licensing ordinance does not give the licensed driver any property interest in being free of competition from additional licensees.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A person may not be deprived of liberty or property without procedural due process. The city ordinance is the source of the property right alleged here, but the scope of that property right is limited. Taxicab licenses do not include a right to be free of competition from additional licensees, because the ordinance does not limit the number of licenses that may be issued and provides for a hearing only when the ground alleged is a lack of qualifications. Therefore, the grant of a license to the woman does not deprive the licensed driver of any property right that would require procedures to protect it. Moreover, there is no statutory right to a hearing because the only ground for a hearing is a lack of qualification, and the decision of whether to grant a pre-termination hearing is up to the discretion of the city licensing officials.\n</s>"

It also permits the name of an independent candidate or a candidate of a smaller party to appear on the general election ballot if that person pays a filing fee of $1,000, and submits petitions signed by at least 3% of the voters who actually cast ballots for the office of governor in the last state election. The state maintains that these filing requirements are necessary to limit the size of the election ballot, to eliminate frivolous candidacies, and to help finance the high cost of elections. Historically, very few of the state's voters who are members of racial minority groups have been members of either of the two major political parties.

The cities of Redville and Greenville are located adjacent to each other in different states. The airport serving both of them is located in Redville and is one of those airports specified in the federal statute. The Redville City Council has adopted a rule that requires any limousines serving the airport to charge only the rates authorized by the Redville City Council. A prominent limousine service has a lucrative business transporting passengers between Greenville and the airport in Redville, at much lower rates than those required by the Redville City Council. It transports passengers in interstate traffic only; it does not provide local service within Redville. The new rule adopted by the Redville City Council will require the prominent limousine service to charge the same rates as limousines operating only in Redville. Must the prominent limousine service comply with the new rule of the Redville City Council?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the airport is located in Redville and, therefore, its city council has exclusive regulatory authority over all transportation to and from the airport.\nB. Yes, because Congress has authorized this form of regulation by Redville and, therefore, removed any constitutional impediments to it that may have otherwise existed.\nC. No, because the rule would arbitrarily destroy a lucrative existing business and, therefore, would amount to a taking without just compensation.\nD. No, because the limousine service is engaged in interstate commerce and this rule is an undue burden on that commerce.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The supremacy clause provides that federal laws preempt conflicting state laws, but here, Congress gave the Redville City Council the power to set the rates.

Moreover, since Congress empowered the Redville City Council to set the rates there is no discrimination by the city against interstate commerce.\n</s>"

The statute provides for three of the board members to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. They serve seven-year terms and are removable only for good cause. The other two members of the board were designated in the statute to be the respective general counsel of the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Government Operations. The statute stipulated that they were to serve on the board for as long as they continued in those positions. Following all required administrative procedures, the board issued an elaborate set of rules regulating the operations of all banks, securities dealers, and commodities brokers. A company that was subject to the board's rules sought a declaratory judgment that the rules were invalid because the statute establishing the board was unconstitutional. In this case, the court should rule that the statute establishing the national board is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. unconstitutional, because all members of federal boards having broad powers that are quasi-legislative in nature, such as rulemaking, must be appointed by Congress.\nB. unconstitutional, because all members of federal boards exercising executive powers must be appointed by the President or in a manner otherwise consistent with the appointments clause of Article II.\nC. constitutional, because the necessary and proper clause authorizes Congress to determine the means by which members are appointed to boards created by Congress under its power to regulate commerce among the states.\nD. constitutional, because there is a substantial nexus between the power of Congress to legislate for the general welfare and the means specified by Congress in this statute for the appointment of board members.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The statute is probably unconstitutional because the members of federal boards must be appointed in a manner consistent with the appointments clause of Article II.

It can create the agency, but appointment of its leaders must comport with Article II, concerning the executive branch. C is incorrect because the necessary and proper clause does not allow Congress to exercise executive branch powers.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an agency in the executive branch of the federal government, issued an important environmental rule. Although the rule had not yet been enforced against them, companies that would be adversely affected by the rule filed a petition for review of the rule in a court of appeals, seeking a declaration that the rule was invalid solely because it was beyond the statutory authority of the EPA. The companies made no constitutional claim. A statute specifically provides for direct review of EPA rules by a court of appeals without any initial action in a district court. The companies filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court requesting immediate review of this case by the Supreme Court before the court of appeals has actually decided the case. The EPA acknowledges that the case is important enough to warrant Supreme Court review and that it should be decided promptly, but it asks the Supreme Court to dismiss the petition on jurisdictional grounds. The best constitutional argument in support of the EPA's request is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the case is not within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as defined by Article III, and it is not a proper subject of that court's appellate jurisdiction because it has not yet been decided by any lower court.\nB. the case is appellate in nature, but it is beyond the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, because Article III states that its jurisdiction extends only to cases arising under the Constitution.\nC. Article III precludes federal courts from reviewing the validity of any federal agency rule in any proceeding other than an action to enforce the rule.\nD. Article III provides that all federal cases, except those within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, must be initiated by an action in a federal district court.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The case is not within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as defined by Article III.

Other corporations incorporated and headquartered in this particular state have successfully resisted such attempts at acquisition. In an effort to preserve jobs in the state and to protect its domestic corporations against their sudden acquisition by out-of-state purchasers, the state legislature enacts a statute governing acquisitions of shares in all corporations incorporated in the state. This statute requires that any acquisition of more than 25% of the voting shares of a corporation incorporated in the state that occurs over a period of less than one year must be approved by the holders of record of a majority of the shares of the corporation as of the day before the commencement of the acquisition of those shares. The statute expressly applies to acquisitions of the state's corporations by both in-state and out-of-state entities. Assume that no federal statute applies. Is this state statute constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because one of the purposes of the statute is to prevent out-of-state entities from acquiring corporations incorporated and headquartered in the state.\nB. No, because the effect of the statute will necessarily be to hinder the acquisition of the state's corporations by other corporations, many of whose shareholders are not residents of the state and, therefore, it will adversely affect the interstate sale of securities.\nC. Yes, because the statute imposes the same burden on both in-state and out-of-state entities wishing to acquire one of the state's corporations, it regulates only the acquisition of the state's corporations, and it does not create an impermissible risk of inconsistent regulation on this subject by different states.\nD. Yes, because corporations exist only by virtue of state law and, therefore, the negative implications of the commerce clause do not apply to state regulations governing their creation and acquisition.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The statute does not classify corporations that can acquire one of the state's corporations, but only regulates the acquisition of those corporations. Therefore, it does not violate the privileges and immunities clause or discriminate against interstate commerce. Additionally, because corporations are created by state law, this statute does not create an impermissible risk of inconsistent regulation on this subject by different states. No other state can regulate how the state's corporations can be acquired.\n</s>"

The state may not impose an undue burden on the ability of women to get abortions at any point in the pregnancy, although after fetal viability, most limitations will not be an undue burden as long as there is an exception for the life and the health of the mother.\n</s>"

Because vaccination rates have declined in recent years, especially in urban areas, the President proposes to appoint a Presidential Advisory Commission on Vaccination which would be charged with conducting a national publicity campaign to encourage vaccination as a public health measure. No federal statute authorizes or prohibits this action by the President. The activities of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Vaccination would be financed entirely from funds appropriated by Congress to the Office of the President for \"such other purposes as the President may think appropriate.\" May the President constitutionally create such a commission for this purpose?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the President has plenary authority to provide for health, safety, and welfare of the people of the United States.\nB. Yes, because this action is within the scope of executive authority vested in the President by the Constitution, and no federal statute prohibits it.\nC. No, because the protection of children against common diseases by vaccination is a traditional state function and, therefore, is reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nD.

Components for these computers are manufactured elsewhere in the state and in other states, then shipped to this city, where the computers are assembled. An ordinance of the city imposes a special license tax on all of the many companies engaged in the business of assembling computers in that city. The tax payable by each such company is a percentage of the company's gross receipts. The state statute that authorizes municipalities to impose this license tax has a \"State content\" provision. To comply with this provision of state law, the city license tax ordinance provides that the tax paid by any assembler of computers subject to this tax ordinance will be reduced by a percentage equal to the proportion of computer components manufactured in the state. A prominent company assembles computers in the city and sells them from its offices in the city to buyers throughout the United States. All of the components of its computers come from outside the state. Therefore, the company must pay the city license tax in full without receiving any refund. Other city computer assemblers use components manufactured in the state in varying proportions and, therefore, are entitled to partial reductions of their city license tax payments. Following prescribed procedure, the company brings an action in proper court asking to have the city's special license tax declared unconstitutional on the ground that it is inconsistent with the negative implications of the commerce clause. In this case, the court should rule\nAnswer Choices:\nA. against the prominent company, because the tax falls only on companies resident in the major city and, therefore, does not discriminate against or otherwise adversely affect interstate commerce.\nB. against the prominent company, because the commerce clause does not interfere with the right of a state to foster and support businesses located within its borders by encouraging its residents to purchase the products of those businesses.\nC. for the prominent company, because any tax on a company engaged in interstate commerce, measured in whole or in part by its gross receipts, is a per se violation of the negative implications of the commerce clause.\nD. for the prominent company, because the tax improperly discriminates against interstate commerce by treating in-state products more favorably than out-of-state products.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The government cannot restrict speech based on its content unless the content falls into a category of speech that is not protected for some reason.

Attending a baseball game in which a number of calls went against the home team, the fan repeatedly stood up, brandished his fist, and angrily shouted, \"Kill the umpires.\" The fourth time he engaged in this conduct, many other spectators followed the fan in rising from their seats, brandishing fists, and shouting, \"Kill the umpires.\" he home team lost the game. Although no violence ensued, spectators crowded menacingly around the umpires after the game. As a result, the umpires were able to leave the field and stadium only with the help of a massive police escort. For his conduct, the fan was charged with inciting to riot and was convicted in a jury trial in state court. He appealed. The state supreme court reversed his conviction. In its opinion, the court discussed in detail decisions of the United States Supreme Court dealing with the First Amendment free speech clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment. At the end of that discussion, however, the court stated that it \"need not resolve how, on the basis of these cases,\" the United States Supreme Court would decide the fan's case. Instead, the court stated, \"this court has always given the free-speech guarantee of the state's constitution the broadest possible interpretation. As a result, we hold that in this case, where no riot or other violence actually occurred, the state constitution does not permit this conviction for incitement to riot to stand.\" The United States Supreme Court grants a writ of certiorari to review this decision of the state supreme court.

May the state collect this tax on the fair rental value of the personal use of the automobiles furnished by the federal government to these employees?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because such a tax would be a tax on the United States.\nB. No, because such a tax would be a tax upon activities performed on behalf of the United States, since the automobiles are primarily used by these federal employees in the discharge of their official duties.\nC. Yes, because the tax is imposed on the employees rather than on the United States, and the tax does not discriminate against persons who are employed by the United States.\nD.

He asserts that these provisions of the ordinance violate the First Amendment as made applicable to the city by the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case, the court hearing the business owner's request for an injunction would probably hold that the adult entertainment provisions of the city zoning ordinance are\nAnswer Choices:\nA. constitutional, because they do not prohibit adult entertainment everywhere in the city, and the city has a substantial interest in keeping the major part of its commercial center free of uses it considers harmful to that area.\nB. constitutional, because adult entertainment of the kind described in these provisions of the city ordinance is not protected by the free speech guarantee of the First and Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. unconstitutional, because they prohibit in the commercial area of the city adult entertainment that is not \"obscene\" within the meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nD. unconstitutional, because zoning ordinances that restrict freedom of speech may be justified only by a substantial interest in preserving the quality of a community's residential neighborhoods.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The city may limit the time, place and manner of adult businesses as long as the restrictions allow enough avenues of expression and protect against the secondary effects caused by such businesses.

A state barber licensing statute provides that the Barber Licensing Board may revoke a barber license if it finds that the licensee has used his or her business premises for an illegal purpose. The licensed barber was arrested by federal narcotics enforcement agents on a charge of selling cocaine in his barbershop in violation of federal laws. However, the local United States Attorney declined to prosecute and the charges were dropped. Nevertheless, the Barber Licensing Board commenced a proceeding against the barber to revoke his license on the ground that the barber used his business premises for illegal sales of cocaine. At a subsequent hearing before the board, the only pieces of evidence against the barber were affidavits by unnamed informants, who were not present or available for cross-examination. Their affidavits stated that they purchased cocaine from the barber in his barbershop. Based solely on this evidence, the board found that the barber used his business premises for an illegal purpose and ordered his license revoked. In a suit by the barber to have this revocation set aside, his best constitutional argument is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the barber's inability to cross-examine his accusers denied him a fair hearing and caused him to be deprived of his barber license without due process of law.\nB. the administrative license revocation proceeding was invalid, because it denied full faith and credit to the dismissal of the criminal charges by the United States Attorney.\nC. Article II requires a penalty of the kind imposed on John to be imposed by a court rather than an administrative agency.\nD. the existence of federal laws penalizing the illegal sale of cocaine preempts state action relating to drug trafficking of the kind involved in the barber's case.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A license is a property right created by state law and cannot be revoked without due process of law.

While in the course of their employment, the three employees of Red negligently released into local Blue waterways some of the chemical samples they had received from the laboratory in Blue. Persons in Blue injured by the release of the chemicals sued the three Red state employees and the state of Red in Blue state courts for the damages they suffered. After a trial in which all of the defendants admitted jurisdiction of the Blue state court and fully participated, plaintiffs received a judgment against all of the defendants for $5 million, which became final. Subsequently, plaintiffs sought to enforce their Blue state court judgment by commencing a proper proceeding in an appropriate court of Red. In that enforcement proceeding, the state of Red argued, as it had done unsuccessfully in the earlier action in Blue state court, that its liability is limited by a law of Red to $100,000 in any tort case. Because the three individual employees of Red are able to pay only $50,000 of the judgment, the only way the injured persons can fully satisfy their Blue state court judgment is from the funds of the state of Red. Can the injured persons recover the full balance of their Blue state court judgment from the state of Red in the enforcement proceeding they filed in a court of Red?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the final judgment of the Blue court is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of Red.\nB. Yes, because a limitation on damage awards against Red for tortious actions of its agents would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC.

In the midst of the trial, the judge prohibited any further televising of the defendant's trial because he concluded that the presence of television cameras was disruptive. The student brought an action in federal district court against the judge in the defendant's case asking only for an injunction that would require the judge to resume the televising of the defendant's trial. The student alleged that the judge's order to stop the televising of the defendant's trial deprived him of property--his investment in cable television service--without due process of law.

The company's building was located in the center of five acres of land owned by the company and devoted wholly to parking for its supermarket customers. City officials refused to grant a required building permit for the coffeehouse addition unless the company established in its store a child care center that would take up space at least equal to the size of the proposed coffeehouse addition, which was to be 20% of the existing building. This action of the city officials was authorized by provisions of the applicable zoning ordinance. In a suit filed in state court against appropriate officials of the city, the company challenged this child care center requirement solely on constitutional grounds. The lower court upheld the requirement even though the city officials presented no evidence and made no findings to justify it other than a general assertion that there was a shortage of child care facilities in the city. The company appealed. The court hearing the appeal should hold that the requirement imposed by the city on the issuance of this building permit is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. constitutional, because the burden was on the company to demonstrate that there was no rational relationship between this requirement and a legitimate governmental interest, and the company could not do so because the requirement is reasonably related to improving the lives of families and children residing in the city.\nB. constitutional, because the burden was on the company to demonstrate that this requirement was not necessary to vindicate a compelling governmental interest, and the city failed to meet its burden under that standard.\nC. unconstitutional, because the burden was on the city to demonstrate that this requirement was necessary to vindicate a compelling governmental interest, and the city failed to meet its burden under that standard.\nD. unconstitutional, because the burden was on the city to demonstrate a rough proportionality between this requirement and the impact of the company's proposed action on the community, and the city failed to do so.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The requirement that the company construct an addition and create a child care center in it is governed by the takings clause of the Constitution. In order to justify a condition on a building permit, there must be a nexus between a legitimate state interest, here the availability of childcare facilities, and the condition. If there is a nexus, there must also be a rough proportionality between the required dedication and the impact it will have on the community. And the city bears the burden of meeting this higher test. Here the city failed to demonstrate the rough proportionality between the requirement and the impact on the residents. The requirement would be a very large burden on the supermarket, since it would at least double the cost of the addition and would doubly reduce the amount of parking available. The addition of one daycare center, however, would have a smaller impact on the community which has a general lack of child care facilities.\n</s>"

It leases the auditorium to any group that wishes to use it for a meeting, lecture, concert, or contest. Each user must post a damage deposit and pay rent, which is calculated only for the actual time the building is used by the lessee. Reservations are made on a first-come, first-served basis. A private organization that permits only males to serve in its highest offices rented the auditorium for its national convention. The organization planned to install its new officers at that convention. It broadly publicized the event, inviting members of the general public to attend the installation ceremony at the city auditorium. No statute or administrative rule prohibits the organization from restricting its highest offices to men. An appropriate plaintiff sues the private organization seeking to enjoin it from using the city auditorium for the installation of its new officers. The sole claim of the plaintiff is that the use of this auditorium by the organization for the installation ceremony is unconstitutional because the organization disqualifies women from serving in its highest offices. Will the plaintiff prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits such an organization from discriminating against women in any of its activities to which it has invited members of the general public.\nB. Yes, because the organization's use of the city auditorium for this purpose subjects its conduct to the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. No, because the freedom of association protected by the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the city from interfering in any way with the organization's use of city facilities.\nD.

Therefore, the prohibition of women from serving as officers in this organization is not unconstitutional. A is incorrect both because the Fourteenth Amendment does not reach this private actor, and also because the private actor does not become a state actor merely by inviting the public to an activity. B is incorrect because the use of the auditorium does not discriminate on the basis of gender; women can come to the installation of new officers, and the use of the auditorium does not make the organization a state actor. C is incorrect because the city could regulate who would be allowed to use its facilities, although some regulations might have to pass strict scrutiny.\n</s>"

In any given case, the grievant and the state alternate in exercising the right of each party to eliminate five members of the board, leaving a panel of three members to decide their case. At the present time, the full board is composed of seven male arbitrators and six female arbitrators. A female state employee filed a sexual harassment grievance against her male supervisor and the state. The state's attorney exercised all of her five strikes to eliminate five of the female arbitrators. At the time she did so, the state's attorney stated that she struck the five female arbitrators solely because she believed women, as a group, would necessarily be biased in favor of another woman who was claiming sexual harassment. Counsel for the state employee eliminated four males and one female arbitrator, all solely on the grounds of specific bias or conflicts of interest. As a result, the panel was all male. When the panel ruled against the state employee on the merits of her case, she filed an action in an appropriate state court, challenging the panel selection process as a gender-based denial of equal protection of the laws.

In making this assertion, the senator relied wholly on research done by her chief legislative assistant. In fact, it was a different man named William and not William the civil servant, who was convicted of these crimes in the state court proceedings. This mistake was the result of carelessness on the legislative assistant's part. No legislation affecting the appointment or discipline of civil servants or the program of the federal agency for which the federal civil servant works was under consideration at the time the senator made her speech about him on the floor of the Senate. The federal civil servant sues the senator and the legislative assistant for defamation. Both defendants move to dismiss the complaint. As a matter of constitutional law, the court hearing this motion should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. grant it as to the legislative assistant, because he is protected by the freedom of speech guarantee against defamation actions by government officials based on his mere carelessness; but deny it as to the senator, because, as an officer of the United States, she is a constituent part of the government and, therefore, has no freedom of speech rights in that capacity.\nB. grant it as to both defendants, because the senator is immune from suit for any speech she makes in the Senate under the speech or debate clause of Article I, Section 6, and the legislative assistant may assert the senator's immunity for his assistance to her in preparing the speech.\nC. deny it as to both defendants, because any immunity of the senator under the speech or debate clause does not attach to a speech that is not germane to pending legislative business, and the legislative assistant is entitled to no greater immunity than the legislator he was assisting.\nD. deny it as to the legislative assistant, because he is not a legislator protected by the speech or debate clause; but grant it as to the senator, because she is immune from suit for her speech by virtue of that clause.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The speech and debate clause of Article I provides that anything said in the course of the federal legislative process is immune from prosecution.

It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside the state, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in the state. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in the state. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in the state. The state legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of the state from faulty science and to protect in-state toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in the state of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in the state satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the state law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it abrogates the obligations of the contracts between the other toy manufacturers and the in-state outlets who have agreed to sell their Martian toys.\nB. No, because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because it deals only with a local matter, the sale of toys in this particular state's stores.\nD. Yes, because the state's interest in protecting the state's children from faulty science justifies this burden on interstate commerce.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The commerce clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution) gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states and, by negative implication, restricts the regulatory power of the states with respect to interstate commerce. Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in the state of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate against the out-of-state toy manufacturers, it has a purely discriminatory effect against them, and the state has less discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate interests cited in the law. The state law therefore violates the negative implications of the commerce clause.\n</s>"

Students, staff, and faculty convicted by campus tribunals of violating the regulation were made subject to penalties that included fines, suspensions, expulsions, and termination of employment. The regulation was widely unpopular and there was a great deal of public anger directed toward the professors who drafted it. The following year, the state legislature approved a severable provision in the appropriations bill for the university declaring that none of the university's funding could be used to pay the two professors, who were specifically named in the provision.

The statute provided that the Forest Service regulations should \"reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, all potential hazards that arise from campfires on Forest Service lands.\" The Forest Service issued the regulations and the schedule of penalties directed by Congress. The regulations include a rule that provides for the doubling of the fine for any negligent or prohibited use of fire if the user is intoxicated by alcohol or drugs. Which of the following is the best argument for sustaining the constitutionality of the Forest Service's rule providing for the fines?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The executive branch of government, of which the Forest Service is part, has inherent rule-making authority over public lands.\nB. The rule is issued pursuant to a valid exercise of Congress's power to delegate rule-making authority to federal agencies.\nC.

An individual applied for a special use permit to operate a group home for convicts during their transition from serving prison sentences to their release on parole. Although the proposed group home met all of the requirements for the special use permit, the zoning board denied the individual's application because of the nature of the proposed use. The individual sued the zoning board seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on constitutional grounds. Which of the following best states the appropriate burden of persuasion in this action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Because housing is a fundamental right, the zoning board must demonstrate that denial of the permit is necessary to serve a compelling state interest.\nB.

Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was \"to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats\" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser sued the county, claiming that the regulation has taken the purchaser's property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the county did not take title to the property from the purchaser.\nB. No, because the regulation has not caused or authorized any uninvited physical invasion or intrusion onto the property.\nC. Yes, because the conservation objective of the county ordinance is not sufficiently compelling to justify the substantial diminution in the property value.\nD. Yes, because the effect of the county's regulation is to deny the purchaser's investment-backed expectation and essentially all economically beneficial use of the property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A government regulation that eliminates the investment-backed expectation and economic value of an individual's property is a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, as applied to the county by the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the regulation has this effect, it constitutes a taking of the purchaser's property, for which the county must pay just compensation. Because the county did not compensate the purchaser for the land, the county has violated the takings clause.\n</s>"

Under State A law, a person who buys from such a dealer acquires good title, even if the property was stolen from a previous owner. The man showed the car at an antique car show in State B. A woman recognized the car as having been stolen from her. Under State B law, a person whose property is stolen may reclaim it, even if the current possessor is an innocent purchaser. The woman sued the man in a State B court to reclaim the car. The man defended, claiming that he had good title under the law of State A. Nevertheless, the State B court applied State B law, and the woman prevailed. The man did not appeal. The sheriff gave the woman possession of the car. Several months later, the woman drove the car to State A. The man brought a new suit against the woman, claiming that the State B court in the prior suit should have applied the State A law, which protected innocent purchasers. The woman appeared and moved to dismiss the suit. What should the State A court do?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Apply the federal law of sale of goods, because the car has moved in interstate commerce.\nB. Apply the State A law, because the car is currently located in State A.\nC. Dismiss the suit, because the State A court must give full faith and credit to the State B judgment.\nD.

A proper lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of this state statute. In that suit, should the court uphold the constitutionality of the statute?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a 48-hour waiting period is excessively long and, therefore, it imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to procure an abortion.\nB. No, because the state law does not provide a bypass procedure that would allow a court to authorize a minor to obtain an abortion without prior parental notification under appropriate circumstances.\nC. Yes, because parents' rights to supervise their minor daughter's health care outweighs any individual right she may have.\nD. Yes, because such parental notification and waiting-period requirements do not impose an undue burden on a minor's right to procure an abortion.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The Supreme Court has held that parental notification requirements violate a minor's right to an abortion unless there is a satisfactory judicial bypass procedure. Such a procedure must allow a court to approve an abortion for a minor without parental notification if the court finds: (1) the minor is sufficiently mature and informed to make an independent decision to obtain an abortion; or (2) the abortion would be in the minor's best interest. Because no such bypass procedure is included in the statute at issue, the court will hold the statute unconstitutional. Answer B is correct and answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

For this debate they requested the use of a meeting room in the law school that is available on a first-come, first-served basis for extracurricular student use. Speakers presenting all sides of the issue were scheduled to participate. The law school administration refused to allow the use of any of its meeting rooms for this purpose solely because it believed that \"such a debate, even if balanced, would have a negative effect on the morale of the law school community and might cause friction among the students that would disrupt the institution's educational mission.\" Is the refusal of the law school administration to allow the use of its meeting room for this purpose constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the law school administration cannot demonstrate that its action was necessary to vindicate a compelling state interest.\nB. No, because the law school administration cannot demonstrate that its action was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nC. Yes, because the law school administration's only concern was the adverse effect of such a discussion of affirmative action on the immediate audience and the mission of the institution.\nD. Yes, because the law students do not have a right to use a state-owned law school facility for a meeting that is not organized and sponsored by the law school itself.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The law school's denial of the meeting room to the student group violates the speech clause of the First Amendment. The meeting rooms are a limited public forum because the law school made the rooms generally available for extracurricular student use. Because the meeting rooms are a limited public forum, the law students had a First Amendment right to use a room for expressive activity consistent with their purpose (i.e., extracurricular student use). Because the law school's denial of the room was based on the content of the students' expression, the denial must be tested by strict scrutiny, which requires the law school to prove that its denial was necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest. It is unusual for the courts to uphold content-based speech restrictions at strict scrutiny, and the law school's concerns here are clearly insufficient to meet that test.\n</s>"

The collector files suit in state court to enjoin collection of the tax on these purchases, claiming that the sales tax is unconstitutional as applied to them.

The statute also provided that public proceedings must precede adoption of the standards, and that once they were adopted, the standards would be subject to judicial review. No standards have yet been adopted. Several officials of the National Bureau of Standards have indicated their personal preference for beer produced by a special brewing process commonly referred to as pasteurization. However, these officials have not indicated whether they intend to include a requirement for pasteurization in the minimum beer quality standards to be adopted by the Bureau. A brewery that produces an unpasteurized beer believes that its brewing process is as safe as pasteurization. The brewery is concerned that, after the appropriate proceedings, the Bureau may adopt quality standards that will prohibit the sale of any unpasteurized beer. As a result, the brewery sued in federal district court to enjoin the Bureau from adopting any standards that would prohibit the sale of unpasteurized beer in this country. How should the district court dispose of the suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Determine whether the Bureau could reasonably believe that pasteurization is the safest process by which to brew beer, and if the Bureau could reasonably believe that, refuse to issue the injunction against the Bureau.\nB. Determine whether the process used by the brewery is as safe as pasteurization and, if it is, issue the injunction against the Bureau.\nC. Refuse to adjudicate the merits of the suit at this time and stay the action until the Bureau has actually issued beer quality standards.\nD. Refuse to adjudicate the merits of the suit, because it does not involve a justiciable case or controversy.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The federal courts lack power to entertain a suit that is not ripe for adjudication, because such a suit does not present a \"case\" or \"controversy\" within the meaning of Article III, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution. The court should dismiss the suit because the Bureau has yet to announce the beer-quality standards, and therefore the case is not ripe. The court may not maintain jurisdiction over the suit by issuing a stay because it lacks the constitutional authority to retain control over the suit. Thus, answer D is correct, and answers A, B, and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state. When it adopted the law, the state legislature declared that its purpose was to reduce the risks of infection of local citrus crops by itinerant diseases that have been found to attack citrus fruit. A national association of citrus growers sued to have the state law declared unconstitutional. The association claims that the law is prohibited by the negative implications of the commerce clause of the Constitution. Which of the following is the best argument in favor of the state's effort to have this lawsuit dismissed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Any burden on interstate commerce imposed by the state law is outweighed by a legitimate state interest.\nB.

The city sold space on its buses for the posting of placards. Decisions on the type of placards that could be posted on the buses were left wholly to the discretion of the administrator of the bus system. Although most of the placards that appeared on city buses were commercial advertisements, the administrator had often sold space on the buses for placards promoting various political, charitable, and religious causes. A circus bought space on the city buses for placards advertising its forthcoming performances. An animal rights organization asked the administrator to sell it space for a placard with photographs showing the mistreatment of animals in circus shows. The administrator denied the organization's request. She said that the display of this placard would be offensive to the circus, which had paid a substantial sum to place its placards on the buses, and that she had been told by a circus employee that none of the photographs on the organization's placard depicted an animal belonging to this particular circus. Under the relevant city ordinance, the administrator's decision was final. The organization sued the administrator in an appropriate court for a declaration that she could not, consistent with the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse to sell the organization space for its placard for the reasons she gave. Will the organization prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the administrator's denial of space to the organization was a reasonable time, manner, and place restriction of speech.\nB. No, because a public official may not allow the use of public facilities for the propagation of a message that he or she believes may create a false or misleading impression.\nC. Yes, because a public official may not refuse to permit the dissemination of a message in a public forum wholly on the basis of its content unless that denial is necessary to serve a compelling government interest.\nD. Yes, because a public official may not refuse to allow the use of any public facility to publish a message dealing with an issue of public concern.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The space on city buses used for the posting of placards qualifies as a designated public forum because it is public property that the city has decided to open for an expressive use. The organization's placard was consistent with the city's designated use of the forum. The city administrator's denial of space to the organization was based on the content of the placard and therefore triggered strict scrutiny, which requires that the denial be necessary to serve a compelling government interest. The reasons cited for the city's denial of the organization's request do not implicate compelling government interests that would justify a content-based speech restriction.\n</s>"

A city filed suit in federal district court against the federal official who enforced this requirement. The city sought an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the statute on the ground that it was unconstitutional. Should the court grant the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the statute is valid under the commerce clause and does not violate the Tenth Amendment.\nB. No, because the federal government has sovereign immunity and cannot be sued without its explicit consent.\nC. Yes, because the statute violates the reserved rights of the states under the Tenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because as applied to state and local governments, the statute exceeds Congress's power under the commerce clause.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The statute satisfies the commerce clause because it regulates a commercial activity (the purchase of cars) that, when aggregated, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The statute does not violate the Tenth Amendment as applied to the city because it does not commandeer the city to regulate the conduct of others pursuant to congressional direction. Instead, it directly regulates the city on the same terms as other entities engaged in the same conduct, which is permissible under the Tenth Amendment. Thus, Answer A is correct and Answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

The investigation revealed that the sun's glare off of these trucks blinded the drivers of other vehicles. The state's legislature then enacted a law prohibiting commercial trucks with polished aluminum trailer exteriors from traveling on the state's highways. Litigation over the state law resulted in a final decision by the United States Supreme Court that the law impermissibly burdened interstate commerce and, therefore, was unconstitutional. Congress later enacted a statute permitting any state to enact a law regulating the degree of light reflectiveness of the exteriors of commercial trucks using the state's highways. Is this federal statute constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the U.S. Supreme Court has already determined that state laws of this type impermissibly burden interstate commerce.\nB. No, because Article III vests the judicial power in the federal courts, the essence of judicial power is the ability to render a final judgment, and this statute overrules a final judgment of the federal Supreme Court.\nC. Yes, because Article I, Section 8 grants Congress authority to enact statutes authorizing states to impose burdens on interstate commerce that would otherwise be prohibited.\nD.

The congressional statute permitting any state to regulate the degree of light reflectiveness of the exteriors of commercial trucks using the state's highways is a valid enactment of the commerce power because commercial trucks are instrumentalities of interstate commerce.

To receive such a license, the ordinance required the individuals to complete 10 hours of instruction in child care, undergo a background check, and pay a $100 fee. The ordinance affected women disproportionately to men, because female babysitters far outnumbered male babysitters in the city. City officials who promoted the measure said that the certification process would ensure that babysitters were adequately regulated for the health and safety of the city's children. Is the ordinance constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it has a disparate impact on women without a showing that the ordinance is necessary to advance a compelling government interest.\nB. No, because it infringes on the freedom of contract without a compelling government interest.\nC. Yes, because any burden it imposes is clearly outweighed by an important government objective.\nD.

The ordinance is not the least restrictive means of promoting a compelling government interest.\nB.

In many other states, such technology was also available at \"diagnostic centers\" that were not affiliated with hospitals. A group of physicians announced its plan to immediately open in the state a diagnostic center that would not be affiliated with a hospital. The state hospital association argued to the state legislature that only hospitals could reliably handle advanced medical technologies. The legislature then enacted a law prohibiting the operation in the state of diagnostic centers that were not affiliated with hospitals. The group of physicians filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state law. What action should the court take?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Uphold the law, because the provision of medical services is traditionally a matter of legitimate local concern that states have unreviewable authority to regulate.\nB. Uphold the law, because the legislature could rationally believe that diagnostic centers not affiliated with hospitals would be less reliable than hospitals.\nC.

The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community's residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens' group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill. The agency officials moved to dismiss. Which of the following is the most appropriate basis for the court to dismiss this suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nB. The interest of the state in obtaining suitable sites for toxic waste landfills is sufficiently compelling to justify the selection of the community as a location for such a facility.\nC.

In response, Congress enacted a statute requiring each state legislature to enact a state law making it a crime for any person to sell, within 1,000 feet of any elementary or secondary school, any controlled substance that had previously been transported in interstate commerce. Is the federal statute constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress has no authority to require a state legislature to enact any specified legislation.\nB. No, because the sale of a controlled substance in close proximity to a school does not have a sufficiently close nexus to interstate commerce to justify its regulation by Congress.\nC. Yes, because it contains a jurisdictional provision that will ensure, on a case-by-case basis, that any particular controlled substance subject to the terms of this statute will, in fact, affect interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because Congress possesses broad authority under both the general welfare clause and the commerce clause to regulate any activities affecting education that also have, in inseverable aggregates, a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Congress's statute is unconstitutional because the U.S. Supreme Court held, in New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), that the concept of federalism embedded in the Tenth Amendment disables Congress from requiring states to enact laws or to administer federal law. Thus, Answer A is correct. Answer B is incorrect. The commerce clause of Article I empowers Congress to regulate economic or commercial activity that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The sale of controlled substances is a commercial activity. The facts disclose \"a dramatic increase in the number of elementary and secondary school students bringing controlled substances to school for sale,\" suggesting that, in the aggregate, this activity has a sufficient effect on interstate commerce to bring the regulation within Congress's commerce power. In addition, the statutory limitation requiring that any controlled substance must have been previously transported in interstate commerce may provide a sufficient jurisdictional nexus with interstate commerce to bring Congress's statute within the commerce power.\n</s>"

Pursuant to this statute, the President has determined that the construction of a surveillance facility on a very small, unused portion of an owner's large tract of land is necessary to safeguard the security of the United States. The construction and operation of the facility will not affect any of the uses that the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land. The owner has filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the construction of a surveillance facility on the parcel of land at issue without compensation. How should the court rule?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It would be a taking of the owner's property for which the owner must be compensated.\nB. It would single out the owner for adverse treatment in violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.\nC. It would not interfere with any use the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land and, therefore, would not entitle the owner to any compensation.\nD.

Nor is it relevant that in this case the construction and operation of the facility will not affect any of the uses that the owner is currently making of the entire tract of land.

Answer B is incorrect. Although the state law classifies state employees who provide the prohibited services and subjects them to a special penalty, the classification is not constitutionally suspect.

Because it is accredited, the university qualifies for state funding for certain of its operating expenses. Under this funding program, 25 percent of the university's total operating budget comes from state funds. A professor at the university was a part-time columnist for the local newspaper. In one of her published columns, the professor argued that \"religion has become a negative force in society.\" The university subsequently discharged the professor, giving as its sole reason for the dismissal her authorship and publication of this column. The professor sued the university, claiming only that her discharge violated her constitutional right to freedom of speech. The university moved to dismiss the professor's lawsuit on the ground that the U.S. Constitution does not provide the professor with a cause of action in this case. Should the court grant the university's motion to dismiss?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the right of the university to employ only individuals who share and communicate its views.\nB. Yes, because the action of the university in discharging the professor is not attributable to the state for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. No, because the accreditation and partial funding of the university by the state are sufficient to justify the conclusion that the state was an active participant in the discharge of the professor.\nD. No, because the U.S. Constitution provides a cause of action against any state-accredited institution that restricts freedom of speech as a condition of employment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The protections afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment apply only to conduct that is attributable to the state. Because the professor was discharged by a private university and not by a state actor, the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply.\n</s>"

The case made its way to the state's highest court, which ruled that the law violated the due process provisions of both the U.S. and the state constitutions.

No, because the state court's decision in this case rests on adequate and independent state law grounds.\nB. No, because the U.S. Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction only over state court decisions that determine the constitutionality of federal laws.\nC. Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over any ruling of a state's highest court based on an interpretation of federal law.\nD.

The result in this case is fully supported by the state court's ruling that the law violated the state constitution, and this ruling is independent of any consideration of the federal constitutional claim.

In an advertisement promoting sales of a particular drug, a drug company claimed that the drug was safe for children. Suit was filed against the company on behalf of a child who allegedly was harmed as a result of taking the drug. At the time the child took the drug, the available medical studies supported the company's claim that the drug was safe for children, but later research proved that the drug actually was harmful to children. The company has moved to dismiss the suit on First Amendment grounds. Should the court grant the motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because false or misleading commercial speech is not constitutionally protected.\nB. No, because the drug business is subject to extensive health and safety regulation.\nC.

The highest bid came from an interstate pipeline company that distributed natural gas to providers throughout the country. A local gas company submitted the next highest bid, which included the commitment that it would pass along to local customers any savings if it was awarded the contract. The state awarded the contract to the local company. The interstate company sued to overturn this decision. Should the interstate company prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the state has a compelling interest in reducing the cost of gas for state citizens.\nB. No, because the state acted as a market participant.\nC.

When the state participates in the economic marketplace, it may decide with whom it wishes to contract without regard to the restrictions of the dormant commerce clause. Here the state is a market participant because it is selling the rights to exploit a natural gas field that it owns. The usual rules of the dormant commerce clause restricting the power of the state to prefer local economic actors over interstate companies therefore do not apply. Answer Answer B is correct.\n</s>"

According to the terms of the federal statute, the first national achievement test was scheduled for administration five years from the effective date of the statute.  After reviewing then-current levels of public school student performance, the officials of a state became concerned that several of its public school districts would lose their federal funding after the administration of the first national achievement test. Then-current levels of private school student performance were substantially higher.  In order to improve the chances of those school districts retaining their federal funding, the state recently enacted a law that requires all children of elementary and secondary school age to attend the schools operated by their respective local public school districts. The law is to take effect at the beginning of the next school year.  Parents of children enrolled in private schools within the state have filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of this state law. Should the court uphold the law?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nB. Yes, because it is necessary to further a compelling state interest.\nC. No, because it is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nD. No, because it is not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n U.S. Supreme Court precedent establishes that a state law requiring children to attend public schools infringes on the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children. Supreme Court precedent also establishes that this right is a fundamental aspect of liberty protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A state law that infringes on that right must therefore undergo strict judicial scrutiny, which requires the state to prove that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest. In this case, the state cannot satisfy strict scrutiny, because requiring private school students to attend public schools in order to raise the test scores in public school districts is not necessary to further a compelling state interest.

Yes, because the ordinance is a content-based regulation of speech.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The ordinance is a content-based regulation of speech because it permits an expressive activity (picketing) on one subject (neighborhood zoning requirements) and prohibits it on all other subjects.

Which of the following is the best argument supporting a motion to dismiss the lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The law promotes a compelling state interest that outweighs any burden on interstate commercial activity that might result from this state regulation of its groundwater.\nB. Groundwater located within a state is not itself an article of interstate commerce, and therefore state regulation of the withdrawal of such groundwater does not implicate the commerce clause.\nC.

An audience of 200 onlookers, who gathered on the steps, heckled him and laughed as he delivered his tirade. The owner of the manufacturing firm repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that \"the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid,\" and that \"I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live.\" After about fifteen minutes the owner of the milk container manufacturing firm stopped speaking, and the amused crowd dispersed. There is one relevant statute of the state which prohibits \"all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m.-8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m.-1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m.-5:15 p.m. on Capitol working days.\" Which of the following possible plaintiffs other than the owner of the milk container manufacturing firm would be most likely to obtain an adjudication in a federal court on the validity of the \"Capitol Steps\" statute?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The defendant was convicted of violating this statute on three separate occasions. Following his most recent conviction, he professed to have undergone a religious conversion and proclaimed himself to be the divine minister of \"St. Rockport,\" an alleged messiah who would shortly be making his appearance on earth. The defendant solicited cash donations from the public to support his efforts to spread the word of St. Rockport and his coming appearance on earth. Following complaints by several contributors who claimed he defrauded them, the defendant was again charged with fraud under this state statute. The charge was that the defendant \"should have known that his representations about St. Rockport were false and, therefore, that he made them solely to collect cash donations for his personal gain.\" A witness for the prosecution in the defendant's trial stated that the defendant had admitted that, at times, he had doubts about the existence of St. Rockport. The defendant was the only religious minister prosecuted for fraud under this state statute. The strongest constitutional defense that the defendant could assert would be that this prosecution\nAnswer Choices:\nA. deprived him of the equal protection of the laws because other religious ministers have not been charged under this statute.\nB. denied him procedural due process because it placed upon the defendant the burden of rebutting evidence, submitted by the state of his bad faith in raising this money.\nC. denied him rights conferred by the obligation of contracts clause by preventing him from taking money from persons who wished to contract with him to spread the word of St. Rockport.\nD. denied him the free exercise of religion in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it required the state to determine the truth or falsity of the content of his religious beliefs.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The government cannot impose a burden on someone because of that person's religious beliefs unless the measure is necessary to promote a compelling government interest. And the government may not evaluate whether the religion is worth protecting or whether the person held a sincere religious belief. Therefore, the strongest constitutional defense is that the government's prosecution denied the defendant the right of free exercise of religion because it required the state to analyze the sincerity of his religious beliefs.\n</s>"

A candidate, who is thinking about running for mayor in an election that will take place next year, will have been a resident of the city for only four and one-half years at the time the mayor elected then takes office. Before he decides whether to run for the position of mayor, the candidate wants to know whether he could lawfully assume that position if he were elected. As a result, the candidate files suit in the local federal district court for a declaratory judgment that the city's five-year-residence requirement is unconstitutional and that he is entitled to a place on his political party's primary election ballot for mayor. He names the chairman of his political party as the sole defendant but does not join any election official. The chairman responds by joining the candidate in requesting the court to declare the city's residence requirement invalid. In this case, the court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. refuse to determine the merits of this suit, because there is no case or controversy.\nB. refuse to issue such a declaratory judgment, because an issue of this kind involving only a local election does not present a substantial federal constitutional question.\nC. issue the declaratory judgment, because a residency requirement of this type is a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\nD. issue the declaratory judgment, because the candidate will have substantially complied with the residency requirement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n There is no case or controversy here because the candidate lacks standing. One reason he lacks standing is that the issue is not yet ripe for review. The issue is not ripe because the candidate will not suffer an injury until he is barred from running for office or until he has won the election. At that point, an injury will either have occurred or will be so certain to occur as to confer standing. The second reason the candidate lacks standing is that the candidate has not joined the correct party to provide him the relief that will redress the injury. The chairman of his local political party would be the correct party to sue if the political party refuses to put him on the ballot due to the residency requirement. However, the candidate seems to be challenging the qualifications with the assumption that he will not be allowed to take office. The correct defendant would be whichever official enforces those qualifications and determines whether elected officials take office, presumably election officials. Finally, the mere agreement by the parties that the court should consider the issue is irrelevant; standing cannot be created by agreement.\n</s>"

A state statute requires occupants of residences with basements susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences tested for the presence of radon and to take specified remedial steps if the test indicates the presence of radon above specified levels. The statute also provides that the testing for radon may be done only by testers licensed by a state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards relating to the accuracy of its testing. These standards may easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology required to meet them is 50% more expensive than the technology required to measure radon accumulations in a slightly less accurate manner. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not license radon testers. However, a federal statute authorizes the EPA to advise on the accuracy of various methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably accurate. A recently established state firm uses a testing method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. The firm is also included by the EPA on a list of testers using methods of testing it believes to be reasonably accurate. The firm applies for a state radon testing license, but its application is denied because the firm cannot demonstrate that the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate to meet the rigorous state statutory standards. The firm sues appropriate state officials in federal court claiming that the state may not constitutionally exclude the firm from performing the required radon tests in the state. In this suit, the court will probably rule in favor of\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the firm, because the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution requires the state to respect and give effect to the action of the EPA in including the firm on its list of testers that use reasonably accurate methods.\nB. the firm, because the supremacy clause of the Constitution requires the state to respect and give effect to the action of the EPA in including the firm on its list of testers that use reasonably accurate methods.\nC. The state, because the federal statute and the action of the EPA in including the firm on its list of testers that use reasonably accurate methods are not inconsistent with the more rigorous state licensing requirement, and that requirement is reasonably related to a legitimate public interest.\nD. The state, because radon exposure is limited to basement areas, which, by their very nature, cannot move in interstate commerce.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The federal statute is very general and does not regulate radon testers to the extent of licensing them. Therefore, the general federal statute does not conflict with the more rigorous state licensing standards, and those licensing standards are not superseded by the federal law under the supremacy clause. Furthermore, the state's licensing requirement is constitutional because it is reasonably related to a legitimate public interest.\n</s>"

In a suit to enjoin the state from firing her, which of the following claims provides the LEAST support for the woman's suit?\\\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Firing her unconstitutionally abridges her freedom of speech.\nB. Firing her unconstitutionally denies her a privilege or immunity of state citizenship protected by Article IV.\nC.

The law provided that the agency would decide the locations and sizes of the landfills after an investigation of all potential sites and a determination that the particular sites chosen would not endanger public health and would be consistent with the public welfare. A community in the state was scheduled for inspection by the agency as a potential toxic waste landfill site. Because the community's residents obtained most of their drinking water from an aquifer that ran under the entire community, a citizens' group, made up of residents of that community, sued the appropriate officials of the agency in federal court. The group sought a declaratory judgment that the selection of the community as the site of a toxic waste landfill would be unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the agency from selecting the community as a site for such a landfill. The agency officials moved to dismiss. Which of the following is the most appropriate basis for the court to dismiss this suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nB. The interest of the state in obtaining suitable sites for toxic waste landfills is sufficiently compelling to justify the selection of the community as a location for such a facility.\nC. The Eleventh Amendment bars suits of this kind in the federal courts.\nD. The case is not ripe for a decision on the merits.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nConstitutional_law\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The case arguably is not ripe for adjudication because the agency's inspection does not itself pose any risk of harm to residents of the community. The residents face a risk of harm only if the agency selects their community as a site for a landfill, but on these facts it is unclear whether or when the community would be selected.

Is the federal statute constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because Congress has no authority to require a state legislature to enact any specified legislation.\nB. No, because the sale of a controlled substance in close proximity to a school does not have a sufficiently close nexus to interstate commerce to justify its regulation by Congress.\nC.

The easement permitted the Water District to enter Barrenacres for only the stated purposes. The Water District promptly and properly recorded the deed. In 1961, the Water District installed a water main which crossed Barrenacres within the described strip; the Water District has not since entered Barrenacres. In 1965, the landowner sold Barrenacres to a purchaser, but the deed, which was promptly and properly recorded, failed to refer to the Water District easement. The purchaser built his home on Barrenacres in 1965, and since that time he has planted and maintained, at great expense in money, time, and effort, a formal garden area which covers, among other areas, the surface of the twenty-foot easement strip. In 2006, the Water District proposed to excavate the entire length of its main in order to inspect, repair, and replace the main, to the extent necessary. At a public meeting, at which the purchaser was present, the Water District announced its plans and declared its intent to do as little damage as possible to any property involved. The purchaser objected to the Water District plans. Assume that the purchaser reserved his rights and after the Water District completed its work sued for the $5,000 in damages he suffered by reason of the Water District entry. The purchaser's attempt to secure damages probably wil\nAnswer Choices:\nA. succeed, because his deed from the owner did not mention the easement.\nB. succeed, because of an implied obligation imposed on the Water District to restore the surface to its condition prior to entry.\nC. fail, because of the public interest in maintaining a continuous water supply.\nD. fail, because the Water District acted within its rights.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The holder of an easement has the right to enter the land to make repairs to the easement. Where those repairs somehow alter or damage the land, the easement holder must reasonably restore the land to the condition that it was in before the repairs were made. In this case, the purchaser has unreasonably obstructed the easement with his garden. Because the Water District has acted within its rights by coming onto the land to make repairs, and reasonable restoration of the land does not include restoring the purchaser's garden, answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The relevant, operative words of the deed conveyed to \"the church [a duly organized religious body having power to hold property] for the life of my son and from and after the death of my said son to all of my grandchildren and their heirs and assigns in equal shares; provided, the church shall use the premises for church purposes only.\" In an existing building on Stoneacre, the church immediately began to conduct religious services and other activities normally associated with a church. In 2005, the church granted a neighbor a right to remove sand and gravel from a one-half acre portion of Stoneacre upon the payment of royalty. The neighbor has regularly removed sand and gravel since 2005 and paid royalty to the church. The church has continued to conduct religious services and other church activities on Stoneacre. All four of the living grandchildren of the grantor joined by a guardian ad litem to represent unborn grandchildren, instituted suit against the church and the neighbor seeking damages for the removal of sand and gravel and an injunction preventing further acts of removal. There is no applicable statute. Which of the following best describes the likely disposition of this lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The plaintiffs should succeed, because the interest of the church terminated with the first removal of sand and gravel.\nB. The church and the neighbor should be enjoined, and damages should be recovered but impounded for future distribution.\nC. The injunction should be granted, but damages should be denied, because the grantor and his son are not parties to the action.\nD. Damages should be awarded, but the injunction should be denied.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The facts indicate that the church holds a life estate (measured by the life of the grantor's son) and the grandchildren hold remainders. As a life tenant, the church has a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste relevant to the property during its life tenancy. A failure to keep the property in repair, pay taxes on the property, or pay interest on any mortgage on the property all constitute permissive waste. Voluntary waste, on the other hand, is an affirmative act that serves to somehow damage the land. This \"damage,\" however, is not necessarily an act that reduces the value of the land. For example, a life tenant's affirmative act of changing the basic use of the land during his tenancy would be characterized as \"damage\" to the land that constitutes voluntary waste. The life tenant is held liable to the remaindermen for any waste during his or her life tenancy. In this case, the facts indicate that the church has committed voluntary waste by allowing the neighbor to remove resources from the land, and also (possibly) by changing the basic use of the land to a purpose other than \"for church purposes.\" The church is liable to the remaindermen (the grandchildren), so an injunction is warranted.\n</s>"

The residuary clause of the will gave the residuary estate to the woman's five children equally. The woman died and was survived by the five children named in her will and by eleven grandchildren. Several additional grandchildren have since been born. In an action for a declaration of rights, it was claimed that the attempted gifts to the woman's grandchildren were entirely void and that the interests following the life estates to the woman's children passed to the children absolutely by the residuary clause. Assuming that the action was properly brought with all necessary parties and with a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the interests of unborn and infant grandchildren, the decision should be that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the attempted gifts to grandchildren are void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. the attempted gifts to grandchildren are void as unlawful restraints on alienation.\nC. the provisions concerning grandchildren are valid and will be upheld according to their terms.\nD. even if the provisions against sale or mortgage by the grandchildren are void, the remainders to grandchildren are otherwise valid and will be given effect.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The key here is \"25 years,\" which identifies this as a Rule Against Perpetuities (\"RAP\") issue. The general rule is that \"No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.\" It is important to break down the woman's devise clause by clause. Courts look to preserve, as much as possible, the interests of the grantor. The devise of a tract of land to the woman's son, for life, is valid and will grant a life estate to her son. The son is the life in being at the creation of the interest, which occurred (by will) at the woman's death, and so the creation of a remainder in the son's children is vested because all the son's children will have been born within 21 years of his death. The RAP violation is contained in the second clause, which attempts to keep the grandchildren from selling the land before they are 25 years old. Since the son could have a child who would not reach the age of 25 within 21 years of the son's death, this clause ONLY would either be removed or be subjected to the \"wait and see\" doctrine (or other provisions), depending on the jurisdiction. The harsh rule of completely striking an entire bequest is not generally followed in American jurisdictions. D properly applies the rule to the fact pattern; and because the woman created identical devises for specific tracts of land for each of her five children, the result would be the same in each. Thus, C is incorrect, as the provisions for the woman's grandchildren will only be partially upheld.\n</s>"

The couple maintained several charge accounts at retail stores under the husband's last name, and they filed joint income tax returns using his last name for both of them. Within this period the man decided to buy a home. The deed was in proper form and identified the grantees as \"Mr. and Mrs. [last name], and their heirs and assigns forever as tenants by the entirety.\" The man made a down payment of $10,000, and gave a note and mortgage for the unpaid balance. The couple signed the note and mortgage as husband and wife. The man made monthly payments as they became due until he and the woman had a disagreement and he abandoned her and the house. The woman then made the payments for three months. She then brought an action against the man for partition of the land in question. The prayer for partition should be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. denied, because a tenant by the entirety has no right to partition.\nB. denied, because the man has absolute title to the property.\nC. granted, because the tenancy by the entirety that was created by the deed was severed when the man abandoned the woman.\nD. granted, because the estate created by the deed was not a tenancy by the entirety.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This question requires you to be able to identify a tenancy by the entirety. Similar to a joint tenancy, a tenancy by the entirety requires the presence of several unities (time, title, interest, possession and person). But unlike a joint tenancy, this type of tenancy requires that the tenants be married. The other distinguishing feature of a tenancy by the entirety is the limit on the ways that it can be severed. A tenancy by the entirety may only be severed: 1) by divorce, 2) by the death of one spouse, 3) by a creditor of both spouses, or 4) by a mutual agreement between the husband and wife. In this case, the man and woman are not husband and wife, and are thereby prevented from entering into a marital estate. As such, answers A and C may be eliminated. Answer B is incorrect because the couple's mistaken assertion in the deed that they had created a tenancy by the entirety did not serve to negate the woman's interest in the property. As it is not a tenancy by the entirety and the woman has an interest in the property, she has a right to seek partition and answer D is correct.\n</s>"

In this case, although the daughter's interest has the potential to run indefinitely, it can be terminated by a later event; specifically, by her allowing the use of the land for anything other than residential and farm purposes. Because the daughter's interest is a fee simple determinable, and because the Rule Against Perpetuities prevents the grant to her son from being valid, the grantor\u2019s interest must be a possibility-of-reverter, making choice B the correct answer.\n</s>"

The man who owns Meadowview prepared a development plan creating 200 house lots in Meadowview with the necessary streets and public areas. The plan was fully approved and duly recorded. However, construction of the streets has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances. College Avenue, a street in the Meadowview development, abuts a parcel of land that is adjacent to Meadowview and owned by a pharmacist. This parcel has no access to any public way except a poorly developed road that is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. The pharmacist sold the parcel to a friend. The description used in the deed was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, \"thence by land of Meadowview, north-easterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less,\" was changed to \"thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview,\" with full reference to the plan and its recording data. The friend now seeks a building permit that shows she intends to use College Avenue for access to her parcel of land. The man objects to the granting of a building permit on the grounds that he has never granted any right to the pharmacist or her friend to use College Avenue. There are no governing statutes or ordinances relating to the problem. The man brings an appropriate action in which the right of the friend to use College Avenue without an express grant from the man is at issue. The best argument for the man in this action is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the friend\u2019s right must await the action of appropriate public authorities to open College Avenue as a public street, since no private easements arose by implication.\nB. the Statute of Frauds prevents the introduction of evidence which might prove the necessity for the friend to use College Avenue.\nC. the friend\u2019s right to use College Avenue is restricted to the assertion of a way by necessity, and the facts preclude the success of such a claim.\nD. the friend would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to use College Avenue.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The man\u2019s best argument is that the friend has not obtained an easement by implication. An easement by implication can arise either through: 1) necessity, or 2) previous use by a common owner. An easement by necessity will be implied where a property is \"landlocked,\" meaning there is no way to access the land without crossing another party's land. But if any means of access does exist, even an inconvenient one, then there is no necessity and no easement will be implied. An implied easement through previous use arises where: 1) the plots of land in question were previously owned by the same party, and 2) that party crossed one plot to get to the other by using an: a) apparent, b) continuous, and c) reasonably necessary route. In this case, the parcel of land is not landlocked because it can be accessed by way of the \"old, poorly developed road.\" Although that road is inconvenient, it still constitutes access, so an easement by necessity will not be implied for the friend. Likewise, the friend cannot obtain an easement based on previous use by a common owner, as the facts do not indicate that these plots ever had a common owner. Therefore, answer A provides the man\u2019s best argument.\n</s>"

The agreement provided that a good and marketable title was to be conveyed free and clear of all encumbrances. However, the agreement was silent as to the risk of fire prior to closing, and there is no applicable statute in the state where the land is located. The premises were not insured. The day before the scheduled closing date, Highacre was wholly destroyed by fire. When the buyer refused to close, the seller brought an action for specific performance.

This is true regardless of whether the seller still physically possesses the land. That is because through the doctrine of equitable conversion, title to the property has been \"converted\" to the buyer through the operation of equitable principles. Because the buyer bears the risk after contracting, and the facts do not indicate the seller was responsible for the fire damage that occurred, the most likely reason for the seller to prevail will be the application of the doctrine of equitable conversion, so answer D is correct.\n</s>"

After two years had expired, the government condemned twenty acres of the property and allocated the compensation award to the landlord and tenant according to their respective interest so taken. It so happened, however, that the twenty acres taken embraced all of the farm's tillable land, leaving only the house, outbuildings, and a small woodlot. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction where the property is located nor any provision in the lease relating to condemnation. The tenant quit possession, and the landlord brought suit against him to recover rent. The landlord will\nAnswer Choices:\nA. lose, because there has been a frustration of purpose which excuses the tenant from further performance of his contract to pay rent.\nB. lose, because there has been a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by the landlord's inability to provide the tenant with possession of the whole of the property for the entire term.\nC. win, because of the implied warranty on the part of the tenant to return the demised premises in the same condition at the end of the term as they were at the beginning.\nD. win, because the relationship of landlord and tenant was unaffected by the condemnation, thus leaving the tenant still obligated to pay rent.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Where the government exercises its condemnation powers, the taking will affect not only the owner of the land, but also any tenants who are leasing that land. The extent of the effect on the tenant's rights depends upon whether there was a complete or partial taking. Where there has been a complete taking (meaning the government has taken all of the property that the tenant was leasing), the lease is automatically terminated, and the tenant has no further obligation to make payments. If, however, there was only a partial taking (meaning some but not all of the land being leased was taken), the tenant is still responsible for making payments, but only in an amount proportionate to the land that was not taken. Note that in the case of a partial taking, the tenant will share in the monies paid by the government to the landlord for the taking to the extent of the tenant's rent liability in the portion of land that was taken. In this case, the facts indicate that part but not all of the land the tenant was leasing was taken by the government. Because there was only a partial taking, the tenant's lease is still in effect.\n</s>"

The diner's business hours are from 9:00 a.m. to midnight. It is in an area that for fifteen years has been zoned for small retail businesses, apartment buildings, and one-and two-family residences. The zoning code specifies that \"small retail business\" includes \"businesses where food and drink are dispensed for consumption on the premises.\" The diner was the first drive-in in the town. For seven years, a husband and wife have owned and lived in their single-family residence, which is across the street from the diner. The diner is heavily patronized during the day and night by high school students. The noise and lights of the cars, the lights illuminating the diner's parking lot, and the noise from the loudspeaker of the ordering system prevented the homeowners from sleeping before midnight. Paper cups, napkins, and other items from the drive-in are regularly blown into the homeowners' front yard by the prevailing wind. The traffic to and from the diner is so heavy on the street in front of their house that the homeowners are afraid to allow their small children to play in the front yard. The homeowners have asserted a claim against the diner based on private nuisance. The most likely effect of the fact that the homeowners were in the area before the diner is that it\nAnswer Choices:\nA. requires that the homeowners' interest be given priority.\nB. is irrelevant because of the zoning ordinance.\nC. is irrelevant because conforming economic uses are given priority.\nD. is some, but not controlling, evidence.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Always check the call of the question first. This fact pattern seems to focus on zoning, but the call of the question requires analysis based on a claim for private nuisance. While the zoning code is important, it will not control a determination of the appropriateness of an activity. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. Likewise, answer A is incorrect because priority of occupation is not controlling. Instead, the character of the locality; the nature, extent and frequency of the harm; and, the utility and social value of the activity involved are all of significant importance in determining whether the defendant's use of neighboring land is substantially and unreasonably interfering with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff's property. Thus C is incorrect. Answer D appropriately addresses the weight of the homeowners' prior occupation in the determination of whether relief under a private nuisance cause of action may be granted. A, B and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

In 1970 Oleg, the owner, conveyed his interest in fee simple \"to my brothers Bob and Bill, their heirs and assigns as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.\" II.

Yes, if Charles, Sam, and Sam's only child (Gene, aged 25) will join in the conveyance.\nC. No, regardless of who joins in the conveyance, because Sam may have additional children whose interests cannot be defeated.\nD. No, regardless of who joins in the conveyance, because a title acquired by quitclaim deed is impliedly unmerchantable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n This question is best answered by charting each party's interest, starting with the first conveyance. 1 - Oleg conveyed to Bob and Bill as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. 2 - Bob died. Because he and Bill held the property as joint tenants, when Bob died his entire interest automatically went to Bill. The conveyances in Bob's will had no effect, because immediately upon his death his interest went to Bill. 3 - Bill died. Because he owned the property outright, he was free to devise his entire interest to Frank. 4 - Frank, the sole owner of the property, conveyed it to Paul. Because Paul is now the sole owner of the property, he may transfer his interest without having to join any other parties in the conveyance, so answer A is correct.\n</s>"

Wanda must pay the portion of the monthly payment which represents interest.\nD. Dixie must pay the full monthly payment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Homer's conveyance created a life estate in Wanda and a vested remainder in Dixie. As a life tenant, Wanda has a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste relevant to the property during her life tenancy. A failure to keep the property in repair, pay taxes on the property, or pay interest on any mortgage on the property all constitute permissive waste. Although Wanda's duty not to commit permissive waste requires her to pay interest on the mortgage, she has no obligation to pay the principal. Therefore, answer C is correct. Answer A is incorrect because Wanda has no obligation to pay the portion of the payment that consists of principal. Answer B is incorrect because the comparative value of the estates is irrelevant to the life tenant's duties - they will remain unchanged regardless of the value. Answer D is incorrect because Dixie is only liable for the principal portion of the payments, not the interest portion that Wanda is obligated to pay.\n</s>"

In general, recording statutes are either race (time-based), notice (based on knowledge of previous purchasers) or race-notice (a combination of the two). Establishing the presence or absence of notice, however, requires consideration of factual evidence beyond simply what is contained in the record. If priority of title is instead fixed solely by the time of recording, no extrinsic evidence need be considered. Priority is determined by a race to the recording office, with the name of the winner being recorded. Answer B is the best choice because the question asks for the best method to fix priorities as definitely as possible.

In this case, when the seller died, he left his real property (which no longer includes the property that was contracted on) to the sister and his personal property (which includes his right to payment for that property) to the friend.

He desires to develop the entire tract as a golf course, country club, and residential subdivision. He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club; the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate the landowner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold. The landowner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established: I. Aside from the country club and golf course, there will be no land use other than for residential use and occupancy in the 1,500 acres. II. The residents of the subdivision will have unambiguous rights and access to the club and golf course facilities. III. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right to transfer his lot to a purchaser with all original benefits. IV. Each lot owner must be obligated to pay annual dues to a pro rata share (based on the number of lots) of the club's annual operating deficit (whether or not such owner desires to make use of club and course facilities). In the context of all aspects of the scheme, which of the following will offer the best chance of implementing the requirement that each lot owner pay annual dues to support the club and golf course?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Covenant\nB. Easement\nC. Mortgage\nD. Personal contractual obligation by each purchaser\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n C can be eliminated immediately. A mortgage is a financial agreement and will not run with the land once the mortgage is satisfied. Likewise, D can be removed. The question asks for the best chance of implementation, which would not be the case in a situation where each land purchaser was able to individually negotiate his or her contractual obligation. In addition, the obligation would only bind the initial parties and would not transfer along with the property, should it be sold. B is not the best answer because, while an easement can run with the land and bind future owners of that land, easements cannot generally be used to require the burdened party to perform affirmative acts. In addition, an easement allows access to the land of the owner, by the holder of the easement, and the creation/operation of a golf course would not necessarily touch and concern the land.\n</s>"

The deed contained descriptions as follows: (I) All of my land and dwelling known as 44 Main Street, Midtown, United States, being one acre. (II) All that part of my farm, being a square with 200-foot sides, the southeast corner of which is in the north line of my neighbor. The deed contained covenants of general warranty, quiet enjoyment, and right to convey. The father handed the deed to his daughter who immediately returned it to her father for safekeeping. Her father kept it in his safe deposit box. The deed was not recorded. The property at 44 Main Street covered 7/8 of an acre of land, had a dwelling and a garage situated thereon, and was subject to a right of way, described in prior deeds, in favor of a second neighbor. The father owned no other land on Main Street. This neighbor had not used the right of way for ten years and it was not visible on inspection of the property. The description of 44 Main Street was\nAnswer Choices:\nA. sufficient, because the discrepancy in area is not fatal.\nB. not sufficient, because it contained no metes and bounds.\nC. not sufficient, because the acreage given was not correct.\nD. not sufficient, because a deed purporting to convey more than a grantor owns is void ab initio.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The description of land found in a deed only needs to be specific enough to allow a party to identify and locate the property. The description does not need to be made in \"metes and bounds,\" but if it is, that metes and bounds description will be given effect, even if contradicted by other descriptive language or characterizations in the deed. Furthermore, while the description need not be exact (and may even contain minor discrepancies), if it is not sufficient to allow location the property, it will be considered inadequate and any attempted transfer of rights using that deed will be void for vagueness. In this case, the description quoted in the facts is sufficient, so answer A is correct. Answer B is incorrect because metes and bounds are not required. Answers C and D are incorrect because, as stated above, minor discrepancies are permissible.\n</s>"

The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. The owner conveyed Lot 1 to a man and Lot 2 to a woman. The owner retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. The woman, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on her lot. The man erected a house on his lot. The owner made no complaint to either the man or woman concerning the houses they built. After both the man and woman had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that one-half of the way was located on each lot. The man and woman exchanged right-of-way deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded. After the man and woman had lived in their respective houses for thirty years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3. The man informed the woman that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected the woman to do the same. In an action brought by the woman to enjoin the man from interfering with her continued use of the common driveway between the two lots, the decision should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the man, because the termination of the necessity for the easement terminated the easement.\nB. the man, because the continuation of the easement after the change of circumstances would adversely affect the marketability of both lots without adding any commensurate value to either.\nC. the woman, because an incorporeal hereditament lies in grant and cannot be terminated without a writing.\nD. the woman, because the removal of the need for the easement created by express grant does not affect the right to the easement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The man does not have the power to interfere with the woman's use of the easement. The easement described in the facts is an express easement. It was not created by implication through a necessity, or through previous use by a common owner; it was created by an express provision in the duly recorded deeds. Although the man now argues that removal of the \"necessity\" that motivated them to create the easement means that the easement will terminate, he is incorrect. An easement by necessity is terminated by the removal of the necessity that created it, but an express easement is created by a writing, not a necessity. Although the man or woman may have personally felt it was necessary to create the easement when they did so, it is not an easement by necessity in the eyes of the law, and is thereby unaffected by the construction of the new public street. Therefore, answer D is correct.\n</s>"

Consequently, C and D can be eliminated immediately; the new owner made the guarantees and will be held liable for his warranties, despite the fact that he hired the abstract company to research title and was not personally aware of the information regarding the power company's right of way. That leaves A and B. A is incorrect because this is not an issue of misrepresentation. The new owner did not make a false statement of material fact; he relied upon the same abstract information that the developer did in purchasing Newacre. B appropriately addresses the issue of the breach of covenants and is the best answer under the facts. A, C and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

The man's wife died in 2000, and the man remarried in 2002 and had a third child in 2004--a daughter. At his death in 2010, the man was survived by his second wife and three children. In a jurisdiction which recognizes the common law Rule Against Perpetuities unmodified by statute, the result of the application of the rule is that the\nAnswer Choices:\nA. remainder to the children and to the grandchildren is void because the man could have subsequently married a person who was unborn at the time the man executed his will.\nB. remainder to the children is valid, but the substitutionary gift to the grandchildren is void because the man could have subsequently married a person who was unborn at the time the man executed his will.\nC. gift in remainder to the sons or their children is valid, but the gift to the daughter or her children is void.\nD. remainder to the children and the substitutionary gift to the grandchildren are valid.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This is a tricky question. The issue of surviving 30 years would appear to trigger a rule against perpetuities (RAP) violation. This is not the case, however. The beneficiaries of the man's will are his own children, after the termination of his second wife's life estate. Their remainder interests vest at their father's death because the class of children will then be closed. Thus, C is incorrect. The creation of his children's interest occurred at the man's death, not at the time the will was written; the RAP was not violated by the man naming his spouse recipient of a life estate, irrespective of which spouse it would be. \"The unborn widow\" problem only arises if the testator devises consecutive life estates, first to the child and then to that child's spouse for life. Thus A and B are incorrect. Vested interests interests do not violate the RAP. The man's will merely states that the vested interest will only become possessory after his wife's death for those of his children who reached the age of 30. No requirement of survival is actually necessary for the gift to vest. Because the interests are vested, the man's substitutionary gift to any grandchildren of the deceased offspring under 30 will also be valid. A, B and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

There are two broad categories of remainders - vested and contingent. A vested remainder is one that is guaranteed to become possessory.

In contrast, a contingent remainder is dependent upon the happening of a later event or the satisfaction of some condition before it will become a possessory interest.

Under the contract, the seller agreed to convey marketable title subject only to conditions, covenants, and restrictions of record and all applicable zoning laws and ordinances. The lot was subject to a 10-foot side line setback originally set forth in the developer's duly recorded subdivision plot. The applicable zoning ordinance zones that property for single-family units and requires an 8.5-foot side line setback. Prior to closing, a survey of the property was made. It revealed that a portion of the seller's house was 8.4 feet from the side line. The buyer refused to consummate the transaction on the ground that the seller's title is not marketable. In an appropriate action, the seller seeks specific performance. Who will prevail in such an action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The seller, because any suit against the buyer concerning the setback would be frivolous.\nB. The seller, because the setback violation falls within the doctrine de minimis non curat lex.\nC. The buyer, because any variation, however small, amounts to a breach of contract.\nD. The buyer, because the fact that the buyer may be exposed to litigation is sufficient to make the title unmarketable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The warranty of marketable title is implied in all land sale contracts. This warranty requires the seller to provide a marketable title to the buyer on (but not before) the closing date. To be considered marketable, the title must be free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictions, covenants, easements or other limiting provisions that are not explicitly identified in the contract. In establishing whether an encumbrance exists with regard to local codes and ordinances, it is important to distinguish between building codes and zoning laws. A property being in violation of the building code is not considered an encumbrance, and title to that building is marketable. In contrast, where a property is in violation of zoning laws, the violation is considered an encumbrance and the title is unmarketable. A buyer will not be expected to perform on the contract where doing so will require her to immediately enter a dispute over whether she holds good title. In this case, the facts indicate that the seller's house is not in compliance with the zoning regulations. As such, the title is not marketable because it may expose the buyer to litigation related to the violation. Therefore, answer D is correct.\n</s>"

[The grantee] shall exercise this right, if at all, within sixty days of receipt of said offer to sell.\" The grantee recorded the instrument. The instrument was not valid as a will. Is the grantee's right under the instrument valid?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because the instrument is recorded.\nB. Yes, because the grantee's right to purchase will vest or fail within the period prescribed by the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nC. No, because the grantee's right to purchase is a restraint on the owner's power to make a testamentary disposition.\nD. No, because the grantee's right to purchase is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The rule against perpetuities (RAP) applies to three types of interests: 1) vested remainders subject to open, 2) contingent remainders, and 3) executory interests. The rule against perpetuities dictates that where any of these interests would vest outside of a life-in-being plus 21 years, it is void. In this case, the owner is a life in being. The grantee's right of first refusal in relation to the property must be exercised within sixty days after the owner decides to sell, or within sixty days after her death, whichever comes first. Therefore, the longest amount of time that will pass before the grantee's right is extinguished is the owner's life plus sixty days. Because the owner's life plus sixty days is within the life-in-being plus 21 years requirement, the RAP is satisfied and the grantee's instrument is valid. Answer B is therefore correct. Answer A is incorrect because recording does not negate the requirement of compliance with the RAP. Answers C and D are incorrect because an owner is free to make such a contractual agreement.\n</s>"

The facts indicate that the second possibility occurred - the daughter died survived by a husband but no children, so according to the man's will, the land goes to the nephew in fee simple.

Two years later, the couple was involved in the same automobile accident. The woman was killed immediately. The man died one week later. Both died intestate. The woman's sole heir is her brother. The man's sole heir is his mother. The brother claimed one-half of the condominium, and the mother claimed all of it.

In this case, the unmarried couple owned their condominium as tenants in common. Although they made a verbal agreement that if one member of the couple died the surviving member would acquire the decedent's interest in the condominium, that agreement is void as violative of the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, each member of the couple held a one-half interest in the property at the time of their death, and had only that interest to convey to their respective heirs. As such, the brother and the mother each inherited a one-half interest in the property, and answer D is correct.\n</s>"

At the time, the company was using bagged cement, which caused little or no dust. In 2000, the plaintiff bought a home approximately 1,800 feet from the cement plant. One year ago, the cement company stopped using bagged cement and began to receive cement in bulk shipments. Since then, at least five truckloads of cement have passed the plaintiff's house daily. Cement blows off the trucks and into the the plaintiff's house. When the cement arrives at the cement plant, it is blown by forced air from the trucks into the storage bin. As a consequence cement dust fills the air surrounding the plant to a distance of 2,000 feet. The plaintiff's house is the only residence within 2,000 feet of the plant. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the cemente company based on nuisance, will the plaintiff prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, unless using bagged cement would substantially increase the cement company's costs.\nB. Yes, if the cement dust interfered unreasonably with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff's property.\nC. No, because the cement company is not required to change its industrial methods to accommodate the needs of one individual.\nD. No, if the cement company's methods are in conformity with those in general use in the industry.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Some of the most basic sticks in the bundle of property rights are those relating to use of one's land. A property owner, whether an individual or a commercial entity, is entitled to make reasonable use of its property. An owner is likewise entitled to use and enjoy her land without invasions of that use and enjoyment by the activities of other owners. In this case, the facts indicate that the cement company's commercial activities result in a large cloud of concrete dust that fills the air on the plaintiff's residential land. Determining the parties' respective rights requires a balancing between the cement company's right to use its property as it wishes on the one hand, and the plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment of her property on the other. For the plaintiff to prevail, she must establish that the cement company's use of its land constituted an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's use of her own. Therefore, answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The first floors of both buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The second floors were rented to various other tenants. Access to the second floor of each building was reached by a common stairway located entirely in Building 1. While the buildings were being used in this manner, the businessman sold Building 1 to a friend by warranty deed which made no mention of any rights concerning the stairway. About two years later the businessman sold Building 2 to a co-worker. The stairway continued to be used by the occupants of both buildings. The stairway became unsafe as a consequence of regular wear and tear. The owner of Building 2 entered upon Building 1 and began the work of repairing the stairway. The owner of Building 1 demanded that the owner of Building 2 discontinue the repair work and vacate Building 1. When the owner of Building 2 refused, the owner of Building 1 brought an action to enjoin the owner of Building 2 from continuing the work. Judgment should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the owner of Building 1, because the owner of Building 2 has no rights in the stairway.\nB. the owner of Building 1, because the owner of Building 2's rights in the stairway do not extend beyond the normal life of the existing structure.\nC. the owner of Building 2, because he has an easement in the stairway and an implied right to keep the stairway in repair.\nD. the owner of Building 2, because he has a right to take whatever action is necessary to protect himself from possible tort liability to persons using the stairway.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The facts indicate that that the second floor of Building 2 is only accessible by using the stairway in Building 1.

For both these reasons, answer C is correct.\n</s>"

Both parcels fronted on Main Street and abutted a public alley in the rear. Lot 1 was improved with a commercial building that covered all of the Main Street frontage of Lot 1; there was a large parking lot on the rear of Lot 1 with access from the alley only. Fifteen years ago, the father leased Lot 1 to his son for 15 years. The son has continuously occupied Lot 1 since that time. Thirteen years ago, without his father's permission, the son began to use a driveway on Lot 2 as a better access between Main Street and the parking lot than the alley. Eight years ago, the father conveyed Lot 2 to his daughter and, five years ago, the father conveyed Lot 1 to his son by a deed that recited \"together with all the appurtenances.\" Until last week, the son continuously used the driveway over Lot 2 to the son's parking lot in the rear of Lot 1. Last week the daughter commenced construction of a building on Lot 2 and blocked the driveway used by the son. The son has commenced an action against the daughter to restrain her from blocking the driveway from Main Street to the parking lot at the rear of Lot 1.

While the woman was on an extended safari in Kenya, the man learned that there were very valuable coal deposits within Blackacre, but he made no attempt to inform the woman. Thereupon, the man conveyed his interest in Blackacre to his wife who immediately reconveyed that interest to the man. The common-law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Shortly thereafter, the man was killed in an automobile accident. His will, which was duly probated, specifically devised his one-half interest in Blackacre to his wife. The woman then returned from Kenya and learned what had happened. The woman brought an appropriate action against the wife, who claimed a one-half interest in Blackacre, seeking a declaratory judgment that she, the woman, was the sole owner of Blackacre. In this action, who should prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The wife, because the man and the woman were tenants in common at the time of the man's death.\nB. The wife, because the man's will severed the joint tenancy.\nC. The woman, because the joint tenancy was reestablished by the wife's reconveyance to the man.\nD. The woman, because the man breached his fiduciary duty as her joint tenant.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The man and the woman held the property in joint tenancy. A joint tenancy cannot be created without the \"four unities\" (time, title, possession and interest), and can be terminated in one of two ways: by partition or by severance. Where one joint tenant makes an inter vivos conveyance of their interest in the property, a severance occurs and the interest transferred is that of a tenant in common. As soon as the man transferred his interest to his wife, the joint tenancy was severed and the property was held by his wife and the woman as tenants in common. When the wife immediately transferred her interest back to the man, the joint tenancy was not recreated because the four unities were no longer present. The man and the woman then held the property as tenants in common, so A is correct. B is incorrect because the man's inter vivos conveyance, not his will, severed the tenancy. D is incorrect because the man had no fiduciary duty to the woman.\n</s>"

Blackacre fronts on a poor unpaved public road, while Whiteacre fronts on Route 20, a paved major highway. Fifteen years ago, the businessman conveyed to his son Blackacre \"together with a right-of-way 25 feet wide over the east side of Whiteacre to Route 20.\" At that time, Blackacre was improved with a ten-unit motel. Ten years ago, the businessman died. His will devised Whiteacre \"to my son for life, remainder to my daughter.\" Five years ago, the son executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Blackacre and Whiteacre to a friend in fee simple. The friend then enlarged the motel to 12 units. Six months ago, the son died and the daughter took possession of Whiteacre.

The seller at that time also executed and delivered an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Whiteacre to the buyer. The seller thought she had title to Whiteacre but did not; therefore, no titled passed by virtue of the Whiteacre deed. Whiteacre consisted of three acres of brushland adjoining the west boundary of Blackacre. The buyer has occasionally hunted rabbits on Whiteacre, but less often than annually. No one else came on Whiteacre except occasional rabbit hunters. Twenty years ago, the buyer planted a row of evergreens in the vicinity of the opposite (east) boundary of Blackacre and erected a fence just beyond the evergreens to the east. In fact both the trees and the fence were placed on Greenacre, owned by a neighbor, which bordered the east boundary of Blackacre. The buyer was unsure of the exact boundary, and placed the trees and the fence in order to establish his rights up to the fence. The fence is located ten feet within Greenacre. Now, the buyer has had his property surveyed and the title checked and has learned the facts. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 15 years. The buyer consulted his lawyer, who properly advised that, in an appropriate action, the buyer would probably obtain title to\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Whiteacre but not the the ten-foot strip of Greenacre.\nB. the ten-foot strip of Greenacre but not to Whiteacre.\nC. both Whiteacre and the ten-foot strip of Greenacre.\nD. neither Whiteacre nor the ten-foot strip of Greenacre.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n To obtain land through adverse possession, a party must for the length of the statutory period: 1) have actual physical possession or occupancy of the land, 2) maintain that possession continuously and without interruption, 3) exclude others from possession, 4) have \"hostile\" possession (be there without permission), and 5) maintain \"open and notorious\" possession. In this case, the buyer has not acquired Whiteacre because he has failed to exclude others from the property (i.e. the hunters), and has not maintained possession continuously or openly (visiting the land less often than annually). The buyer has, however, obtained possession of the ten-foot strip of Greenacre by erecting a fence (exclusive) and planting trees (open and notorious), without permission (hostile), and maintaining his actual possession continuously for the fifteen year statutory period.

Six years ago, the leasing company leased a one-acre parcel, located in the northeasterly corner of Blackacre, for a term of 30 years, to a restaurant. The restaurant intended to and did construct a fast-food restaurant on the one-acre parcel. The lease provided that: I. The restaurant was to maintain the one-acre parcel and improvements thereon, to maintain full insurance coverage on the one-acre parcel, and to pay all taxes assessed against the one-acre parcel. II. The leasing company was to maintain the access roads and the parking lot areas platted on those portions of Blackacre that adjoined the one-acre parcel and to permit the customers of the restaurant to use them in common with the customers of the other commercial users of the remainder of Blackacre. III. The restaurant was to pay its share of the expenses for the off-site improvements according to a stated formula. Five years ago, the leasing company sold the one-acre parcel to an investor; the conveyance was made subject to the lease to the restaurant. However, the investor did not assume the obligations of the lease and the leasing company retained the remainder of Blackacre. Since that conveyance five years ago, the restaurant has paid rent to the investor. The restaurant refused to pay its formula share of the off-site improvement costs as provided in the lease. The leasing company brought an appropriate action against the restaurant to recover such costs. The most likely outcome would be in favor of\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the leasing company, because the use of the improvements by the customers of the restaurant imposes an implied obligation on the restaurant.\nB. the leasing company, because the conveyance of the one-acre parcel to the investor did not terminate the restaurant's covenant to contribute.\nC. the restaurant, because the conveyance of the one-acre parcel to the investor terminated the privity of estate between the leasing company and the restaurant.\nD. the restaurant, because the investor, as the restaurant's landlord, has the obligation to pay the maintenance costs by necessary implication.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The leasehold agreement created a contractual obligation that required the leasing company and the restaurant to meet certain conditions.

The restaurant's obligations were likewise unaffected by the sale to the investor, so answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The brother lived in one of the two apartments and rented the other apartment to a tenant. The brother got in a fight with the tenant and injured him. The tenant obtained and properly filed a judgment for $10,000 against the brother. The statute in the jurisdiction reads: Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered. The sister, who lived in a distant city, knew nothing of the tenant's judgment. Before the tenant took any further action, the brother died. The common-law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. The sister then learned the facts and brought an appropriate action against the tenant to quiet title to Blackacre. The court should hold that the tenant has\nAnswer Choices:\nA. a lien against the whole of Blackacre, because he was a tenant of both the brother and the sister at the time of the judgment.\nB. a lien against the brother's undivided one-half interest in Blackacre, because his judgment was filed prior to the brother's death.\nC. no lien, because the sister had no actual notice of the tenant's judgment until after the brother's death.\nD. no lien, because the brother's death terminated the interest to which the tenant's lien attached.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n One of the rights associated with a joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. Where two parties hold a property in joint tenancy and one dies, the decedent's interest in the property terminates and the survivor's interest is increased to 100%.

He died and by will, duly admitted to probate, devised Blueacre to his surviving widow for life with remainder in fee simple to his three children, Anne, Betty, and Carter. All three children survived the decedent. At the time of the decedent's death, there existed a mortgage on Blueacre that the decedent had given ten years earlier to secure a loan for the purchase of the farm. At his death, there remained $40,000 in unpaid principal, payable in installments of $4,000 per year for the next ten years. In addition, there was interest due at the rate of 10% per annum, payable annually with the principal installment. The widow took possession and, out of a gross income of $50,000 per year, realized $25,000 net income after paying all expenses and charges except the principal installment and interest due on the mortgage. Carter and Anne wanted the three children, including Betty, to each contribute one-third of the amount needed to pay the mortgage installments. Betty objected, contending that the widow should pay all of these amounts out of the profits she had made in operation of the farm. When foreclosure of the mortgage seemed imminent, Betty sought legal advice. If Betty obtained sound advice relating to her rights, she was told that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. her only protection would lie in instituting an action for partition to compel the sale of the life estate of the widow and to obtain the value of Betty's one-third interest in remainder.\nB. she could obtain appropriate relief to compel the widow personally to pay the sums due because the income is more than adequate to cover these amounts.\nC. she could be compelled personally to pay her share of the amounts due because discharge of the mortgage enhances the principal.\nD. she could not be held personally liable for any amount, but her share in remainder could be lost if the mortgage installments were not paid.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Life tenants have a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste with regard to the property during their life tenancy. A failure to keep the property in repair, pay taxes on the property, or pay interest on any mortgage on the property all constitute permissive waste. The facts indicate that the widow has a life estate, and that the three children all hold a remainder in fee simple. Although the widow's duty not to commit permissive waste requires her to pay interest on the mortgage, she has no obligation to pay the principal. Betty cannot be held liable for the widow's failure to pay the interest, or for the failure of the holders of the future interest to make the principal payments. Betty does, however, risk losing her share of the remainder in Blueacre if the holder of the mortgage forecloses on the property. Therefore answer D is correct, and answers A, B, and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

Subsequently, the mortgage company sold the man's note and mortgage to a bank and delivered to the bank a written assignment of the man's note and mortgage. The assignment was promptly and properly recorded. The mortgage company retained possession of both the note and the mortgage in order to act as collecting agent.

The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The owner later mortgaged Blackacre to a woman to secure a loan of $50,000. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Subsequently, the owner conveyed Blackacre to a businessman. About a year later, the businessman borrowed $100,000 from an elderly widow and gave her a mortgage on Blackacre to secure repayment of the loan. The elderly widow did not know about the mortgage held by the woman. The understanding between the businessman and the elderly widow was that the businessman would use the $100,000 to pay off the mortgage held by the man and that the elderly widow would, therefore, have a first mortgage on Blackacre. The elderly widow's mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The businessman paid the $100,000 received from the elderly widow to the man and obtained and recorded a release of the the man's mortgage. The $50,000 debt secured by the woman's mortgage was not paid when it was due, and the woman brought an appropriate action to foreclose, joining the owner, the businessman, and the elderly widow as defendants and alleging that the woman's mortgage was senior to the elderly widow's mortgage on Blackacre. If the court rules that the elderly widow's mortgage is entitled priority over the woman's mortgage, which of the following determinations are necessary to support that ruling? I. The man's mortgage was originally senior to the woman's mortgage. II. The elderly widow is entitled to have the man's mortgage revived for her benefit, and the elderly widow is entitled to be subrogated to the man's original position as senior mortgagee. III. There are no countervailing equities in favor of the woman.\nAnswer Choices:\nA. I and II only.\nB. I and III only.\nC. II and III only.\nD. I, II, and III.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Where there are multiple mortgages given on a property, and none were purchase money mortgages, priority is determined according to which mortgages came first in time. When presented with a complicated fact pattern such as this one, you will find it helpful to quickly diagram the various parties and their interests. In this case, the man's mortgage came first, followed by the woman's and the businessman's. The elderly widow, however, came along and paid off the first (senior) mortgage, obtaining that first mortgage herself. Although the woman came before the elderly widow in the timeline of events listed in the facts, recall as stated above that priority is determined by which mortgage came first in time, not which party came first. As such, the man's mortgage (now held by the elderly widow) is senior to the woman's, and the elderly widow is entitled to hold the man's position as senior mortgagee. Because the facts do not indicate some other equitable considerations that would support a decision in favor of the woman, the elderly widow's mortgage is entitled to priority and answer D is correct. A, B, and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

After probate of the will became final and the administration on the owner's estate was closed, the friend instituted an appropriate action to quiet title to Blueacre and properly served as defendant each Protestant church situated in the county. The only evidence introduced consisted of the chain of title under which the owner held, the probated will, the recorded deed, the fact that no person knew about the deed except the owner and his lawyer, and the conversation the owner had with his lawyer described above. In such action, judgment should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the friend, because there is inadequate identification of the grantees in the deed.\nB. the friend, because the state of the evidence would not support a finding of delivery of the deed.\nC. the defendants, because a deed is prima facie valid until rebutted.\nD. the defendants, because recording established prima facie delivery until rebutted.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Delivery of a deed can be proven by establishing that there was an intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. In this question, the problem is not that the deed was not effectively delivered, but that it does not adequately identify the grantees. A grant to \"the leaders of all the Protestant Churches in York County\" is simply too broad and vague to adequately identify the intended grantees, so answer A is correct. Answers B and D are incorrect because establishing the delivery of a deed that does not adequately identify a grantee to whom it was delivered will not suffice to establish legal title. Further, a deed is not automatically considered valid on its face until rebutted, so answer C is also incorrect.\n</s>"

The deed was not recorded. The gas company owner constructed and operated a filling station on Whiteacre and then conveyed Whiteacre to his nephew, who continued the filling station use. The deed did not refer to the restrictive covenant and was promptly and properly recorded. The businessman then conveyed Blackacre to a man, who knew about the businessman's covenant prohibiting the filling station use but nonetheless completed the transaction when he noted that no such covenant was contained in the businessman's deed to him.

The lease was promptly and properly recorded. It contained an option for the tenant to purchase Whiteacre by tendering $250,000 as a purchase price any time \"during the term of this lease.\" One year later, the tenant, by a properly executed written instrument, purported to assign the option to his brother, expressly retaining all of the remaining terms of the lease. The instrument of assignment was promptly and properly recorded. Two years later, the owner contracted to sell Whiteacre to his friend and to convey a marketable title \"subject to rights of the tenant under her lease.\" The friend refused to close because of the outstanding option assigned to the brother. The owner brought an appropriate action against the friend for specific performance. If judgment is rendered in favor of the owner, it will be because the relevant jurisdiction has adopted a rule on a key issue as to which various state courts have split. Which of the following identifies the determinative rule or doctrine upon which the split occurs, and states the position favorable to the owner.\nAnswer Choices:\nA. In a contract to buy, any form of \"subject to a lease\" clause that fails to mention expressly an existing option means that the seller is agreeing to sell free and clear of any option originally included in the lease.\nB. Marketable title can be conveyed so long as any outstanding option not mentioned in the purchase contract has not yet been exercised.\nC. Options to purchase by lessees are subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nD. Options to purchase contained in a lease cannot be assigned separately from the lease.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This is a reading comprehension question and can be answered through the process of elimination. The key issue is that the tenant only has a lease for years, which is not a complete ownership interest, but merely a nonfreehold estate in Whiteacre. The tenant's option to purchase was \"during the term of this lease.\" The tenant does not have a property interest in the option; he only has an alienable interest in the leasehold itself, allowing him to assign his entire interest or to sublet his interest by granting possession of the estate for a term of years that is less than the entire interest. Therefore, A and B can be eliminated immediately because the choices want the reader to erroneously assume a transfer of property has occurred. The tenant had a lease for years that contained an option to purchase, not a contract to buy Whiteacre that contained a lease clause. In addition, marketable title is not at issue because the property was not sold. The issue is whether a leasehold estate can assign its option to purchase while keeping the remaining terms of the lease. C is clearly incorrect because the option to purchase must be exercised within ten years, removing it from any potential rule against perpetuities violation. That leaves D, which correctly states that options to purchase contained in a lease for years cannot be assigned separately from the lease. A, B and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

On Blackacre, the religious group erected a large residential building where its members reside. Blackacre is surrounded by rural residential properties and its only access to a public way is afforded by an easement over a strip of land 30 feet wide. The easement was granted to the religious group by deed from a businesswoman, the owner of one of the adjacent residential properties. The religious group built a driveway on the strip, and the easement was used for 20 years without incident or objection. Last year, as permitted by the applicable zoning ordinance, the religious group constructed a 200-bed nursing home and a parking lot on Blackacre, using all of Blackacre that was available for such development. The nursing home was very successful, and on Sundays visitors to the nursing home overflowed the parking facilities on Blackacre and parked all along the driveway from early in the morning through the evening hours. After two Sundays of the resulting congestion and inconvenience, the businesswoman erected a barrier across the driveway on Sundays preventing any use of the driveway by anyone seeking access to Blackacre. The religious group objected. The businesswoman brought an appropriate action to terminate the easement. The most likely result in this action is that the court will hold for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The businesswoman, because the religious group excessively expanded the use of the dominant tenement.\nB. The businesswoman, because the parking on the driveway exceeded the scope of the easement.\nC. The religious group, because expanded use of the easement does not terminate the easement.\nD. The religious group, because the businesswoman's use of self-help denies her the right to equitable relief.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Unless the terms of an easement state otherwise, it is assumed that the easement is permanent and that it will be used for the reasonable development of the dominant estate. In this case, the religious group is a religious organization with a large number of members living on Blackacre. Although the nursing home has increased use of the easement on one day of the week, such use (increased traffic to a religious group's facility on a Sunday) is the type that would have been reasonably contemplated by the parties at the time the easement was granted, so answer C is correct. Answers A and B are incorrect for that same reason. Answer D is incorrect because it is legally inaccurate - the use of self-help by a party (where it is legally entitled to do so) will not negate its right to equitable relief.\n</s>"

The neighbor took possession of the barn and used it for his farming purposes. The lease made the farmer responsible for structural repairs to the barn, unless they were made necessary by actions of the neighbor. One year later, the farmer conveyed the barn and its associated land to a buyer \"subject to the lease to [the neighbor].\" The neighbor paid the next month's rent to the buyer. The next day a portion of an exterior wall of the barn collapsed because of rot in the interior structure of the wall. The wall had appeared to be sound, but a competent engineer, on inspection, would have discovered its condition. Neither the buyer nor the neighbor had the barn inspected by an engineer. The neighbor was injured as a result of the collapse of the wall. The farmer had known that the wall was dangerously weakened by rot and needed immediate repairs, but had not told the neighbor or the buyer. There is no applicable statute. The neighbor brought an appropriate action against the farmer to recover damages for the injuries he sustained. The buyer was not a party. Which of the following is the most appropriate comment concerning the outcome of this action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The neighbor should lose, because the buyer assumed all of the farmer's obligations by reason of the neighbor's assignment to her.\nB. The neighbor should recover, because there is privity between lessor and lessee and it cannot be broken unilaterally.\nC. The neighbor should recover, because the farmer knew of the danger but did not warn the neighbor.\nD. The neighbor should lose, because he failed to inspect the barn.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Answer A is incorrect because even though the buyer assumed all of the farmer's obligations related to the lease, the farmer's concealment of the dangerous condition rendered him, rather than the buyer, liable for the neighbor's damages. Answer D is incorrect because a layperson's inspection would only have revealed an open and obvious hazard or defect, not a hidden structural defect such as this. Answer B is incorrect because privity is irrelevant to determining the farmer's liability for the damages that followed his concealment of the dangerously weakened wall. Answer C is correct and the neighbor should recover.\n</s>"

The buyer recorded the deed four days later. After the conveyance but prior to the buyer's recording of the deed, a lender properly filed a judgment against the owner. The two pertinent statutes in the jurisdiction provide the following: 1) any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered, and 2) no conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.The recording act has no provision for a grace period. The lender joined both the owner and the buyer in an appropriate action to foreclose the judgment lien against Blackacre.If the lender is unsuccessful, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the owner's warranty of title to the buyer defeats the lender's claim.\nB. the lender is not a purchaser for value.\nC. any deed is superior to a judgment lien.\nD. four days is not an unreasonable delay in recording a deed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The recording statute identified in the facts is a notice act. To prevail under a notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded their deed without notice of earlier purchasers. To be a BFP, a party must give value for their interest in the land. In this case, the lender's interest arises from a judgment lien against the owner rather than payment of valuable consideration. Therefore, the lender is not protected by the recording statute. Because the buyer is protected by the statute, the owner no longer holds an interest in Blackacre, and there is no property for the lien to attach to. Answer B is therefore correct.\n</s>"

Shortly thereafter, the grandfather died testate. His grandson was his only heir at law. The grandfather's will left his entire estate to First Church. Twenty-five years ago, when he was 41, the grandson married Maria who was then 20 years old; they had one child. Maria and the child were killed in an automobile accident three years ago when the child was 21. The child died testate, leaving his entire estate to the American Red Cross. His father (the grandson) was the child's sole heir at law. Two years ago, the grandson married Zelda. They had no children. This year, the grandson died testate, survived by his widow, Zelda, to whom he left his entire estate. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unchanged by statute in the jurisdiction. In an appropriate action to determine the ownership of Greenacre, the court should find that title is vested in\nAnswer Choices:\nA. First Church, because the widow of the grandson was unborn at the time of conveyance and, hence, the remainder violated the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. Zelda, because her life estate and her inheritance from the grandson (who was the grandfather's sole heir at law and who was the child's sole heir at law) merged the entire title in her.\nC. the American Red Cross, because the child had a vested remaider interest (as the only child of the grandson) that he inherited, the life estate to the grandson's widow being of no force and effect.\nD. Zelda for life under the terms of the grandfather's deed, with the remainder to the American Red Cross as the successor in interest to the grandson's only child.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This is a tricky question because many of the facts are designed to create concerns that the Greenacre conveyance violates the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP). The general rule is that \"No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.\" It is important to remember, however, that vested interests are not subject to the RAP. Interests are vested if there is no condition attached which must be satisfied; the holder of the vested remainder has a present or certain right to take possession of the property when the prior estates terminate. The grandfather conveyed his entire interest in the tract of land, leaving no reversion or contingent remainder. Consequently, despite the fact that the grandson was only six years old and that his future wife was not yet born at the time the grandfather conveyed the property to him, all interests would clearly vest or fail within the grandson's life. The grandson is the measuring life. Upon the grandson's death, there would be no possibility of an additional wife or children arriving more than 21 years later. Consequently, Zelda's interest in a life estate vested upon her marriage to the grandson. Likewise, the grandson's child's interest vested upon his birth; his future possessory interest did not lapse upon his death but rather was devisable.  Answer D is correct because it acknowledges the vested state of the interests. A, B and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

Blackacre abuts Whiteacre, a tract of land owned by the state's governmental energy agency. At Whiteacre, the agency has operated a waste-to-electricity recycling facility for 12 years. Blackacre and Whiteacre are in a remote area and Whiteacre is the only developed parcel of real estate within a ten-mile radius. The boundary line between Blackacre and Whiteacre had never been surveyed or marked on the face of the earth. During the past 12 years, some of the trucks bringing waste to the agency facility have dumped their loads so that the piles of waste extend from Whiteacre onto a portion of Blackacre. However, prior to the four-week period during each calendar year when the agency facility is closed for inspection and repairs, the waste piles are reduced to minimal levels so that during each of the four-week closures no waste was, in fact, piled on Blackacre. Neither the man nor any representative of the agency knew the facts about the relation of the boundary line to the waste piles. The time for acquiring title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years. Last year, the man died, and his son succeeded him as the owner of Blackacre. The son became aware of the facts, demanded that the agency stop using Blackacre for the piling of waste, and, when the agency refused his demand, brought an appropriate action to enjoin any such use of Blackacre in the future. If the agency prevails in that action, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the facts constitute adverse possession and title to the portion of Blackacre concerned has vested in the agency.\nB. The man's failure to keep himself informed as to the agency's use of Blackacre and his failure to object constituted implied consent to the continuation of that use.\nC. the interest of the public in the conversion of waste to energy overrides any entitlement of the son to equitable remedies.\nD. the power of eminent domain of the state makes the claim of the son moot.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n To obtain land through adverse possession, a party must for the length of the statutory period: 1) have actual physical possession or occupancy of the land, 2) maintain that possession continuously and without interruption, 3) exclude others from possession, 4) have \"hostile\" possession (be there without permission), and 5) maintain \"open and notorious\" possession. In this case, the agency had actual physical possession of the land beneath the waste piles, maintained that possession continuously for 12 years, excluded the man and his son from using that area of land, did so without permission, and did so openly (as the piles were large and were not concealed). Although the agency took the waste out of Blackacre for four-weeks each year, the possession is consistent with the type the usual owner of Blackacre would make, since it is an undeveloped tract and would reasonably be used as a waste dump and cleaned once a year. Therefore, answer A is correct.\n</s>"

Five years ago, he executed and delivered to a woman an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed that conveyed Greenacre to the woman \"for and during the term of her natural life.\" No other estate or interest or person taking an interest was mentioned. The woman took possession of Greenacre and has remained in possession. Fifteen months ago, the owner died, leaving a will that has been duly admitted to probate. The will, inter alia had the following provision: \"I devise Greenacre to my best friend for her natural life and from and after her death to my second best friend, his heirs and assigns, forever.\" Administration of the owner's estate has been completed. The best friend claims the immediate right to possession of Greenacre. The second best friend also asserts a right to immediate possession. In an appropriate lawsuit to which the woman, the best friend, and the second best friend are parties, who should be adjudged to have the right to immediate possession?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The woman, because no subsequent act of the owner would affect her life estate.\nB. The best friend, because the owner's will was the final and definitive expression of his intent.\nC. The best friend, because the woman's estate terminated with the death of the owner.\nD. The second best friend, because the woman's estate terminated with the owner's death and all that the owner had was the right to transfer his reversion in fee simple.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n In this case, the woman and the best friend both have a life estate, and the second best friend has a vested remainder. The woman's grant was for the term of her natural life only, which means that the land reverts back to the owner upon the woman's death. If the owner were deceased by the time that occurred, the land would go to the owner's estate. The owner, however, devised a life estate to the best friend in his will. Therefore, upon the woman's death, the land will go to the best friend for the rest of her life, and then to the second best friend permanently. The woman's life estate is unaffected by any action the owner took after he conveyed it to her, so answer A is correct. Answers C and D are incorrect because the woman's life estate is measured by her own life, not the owner's. Although answer B correctly states that the owner's will was the final expression of his intent, that fact does not alter the woman's life estate in any way, it simply determines where the land goes after she dies.\n</s>"

He conveyed in fee simple Lot 1 to a veterinarian. The deed was in usual form of a warranty deed with the following provision inserted in the appropriate place: \"Grantor, for himself, his heirs and assigns, does covenant and agree that any reasonable expense incurred by grantee, his heirs and assigns, as the result of having to repair the retaining wall presently situated on Lot 1 at the common boundary with Lot 2, shall be reimbursed one-half the costs of repairs; and by this provision the parties intend a covenant running with the land.\" The veterinarian conveyed Lot 1 in fee simple to a woman by warranty deed in usual and regular form. The deed omitted any reference to the retaining wall or any covenant. Fifty years after the owner's conveyance to the veterinarian, the woman conveyed Lot 1 in fee simple to a man by warranty deed in usual form; this deed omitted any reference to the retaining wall or the covenant. There is no statute that applies to any aspect of the problems presented except a recording act and a statute providing for acquisition of title after ten years of adverse possession. All conveyances by deeds were for a consideration equal to fair market value. The deed from the owner to the veterinarian was never recorded. All other deeds were promptly and properly recorded. Lot 2 is now owned by a businessman, who took by intestate succession from the owner, now dead. The man expended $3,500 on the retaining wall. Then he obtained all of the original deeds in the chain from the owner to him. Shortly thereafter, the man discovered the covenant in the owner's deed to the veterinarian. He demanded that the businessman pay $1,750, and when the businessman refused, the man instituted an appropriate action to recover that sum from the businessman. In such action, the businessman asserted all defenses available to him. If judgment is for the businessman, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The man is barred by adverse possession.\nB. The veterinarian's deed from the owner was never recorded.\nC. The man did not know about the covenant until after he had incurred the expenses and, hence, could not have relied on it.\nD. The man's expenditures were not proved to be reasonable and customary.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This question deals with a covenant running with the land. There are four elements that must be met for a restrictive covenant to run with the land, including: 1) intent for it to run with the land, 2) notice if the successor is a bona fide purchaser, 3) it must \"touch and concern\" the land, and 4) privity of estate. The covenant in this case expressly states it is intended to run with the land, the businessman is not a bona fide purchaser because he inherited the land (therefore notice is not required), it touches and concerns the land because it serves to make the land more valuable or useful, and there is privity between the parties. Because the covenant runs with the land, and its terms expressly state that any expenditures related to the retaining wall must be \"reasonable\" to be reimbursed, the only way judgment would be entered in favor of the businessman is if the man's expenditures were unreasonable, so answer D is correct.Answer B is incorrect because reliance is irrelevant to determining whether a covenant is enforceable.\n</s>"

The contract was assignable by the woman. The woman duly notified the owner to convey title to the woman and a friend of the woman whom the woman had not seen for many years. When the woman learned that the friend would have to sign certain documents in connection with the closing, she asked her brother to attend the closing and pretend to be the friend. The woman and her brother attended the closing, and the owner executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Blackacre to the woman and the friend, as tenants in common. The brother pretended that he was the friend, and he signed the friend's name to all the required documents. The woman provided the entire $50,000 consideration for the transaction.

The nephew brought an appropriate action against the owner and the woman to quiet title to an undivided one-half interest in Blackacre. The court should hold that legal title to Blackacre is vested\nAnswer Choices:\nA. all in the owner.\nB. all in the woman.\nC. one-half in the woman and one-half in the owner.\nD. one-half in the woman and one-half in the nephew.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n A deed to a dead person cannot convey good title. Therefore, while the woman obtained an interest in the property for herself when the deed was delivered to her, the interest that she fraudulently attempted to convey to the friend by having her brother forge the friend's name remained the owner's property and was never passed. The friend never held an interest in the property, and thereby had no interest in it to bequeath to the nephew. Because the execution of the contract was only valid with regard to the woman, she and the owner both hold a one-half interest in the property, so answer C is correct, and A, B, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

Blackacre was fairly worth $100,000, so the owner tried to borrow $60,000 from a lender on the security of Blackacre. The lender agreed, but only if the owner would convey Blackacre to the lender outright by warranty deed, with the lender agreeing orally to reconvey to the owner once the loan was paid according to its terms. The owner agreed, conveyed Blackacre to the lender by warranty deed, and the lender paid the owner $60,000 cash. The lender promptly and properly recorded the the owner's deed. Now, the owner has defaulted on repayment with $55,000 still due on the loan. The owner is still in possession. Which of the following best states the parties' rights in Blackacre?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The lender's oral agreement to reconvey is invalid under the Statute of Frauds, so the lender owns Blackacre outright.\nB. The owner, having defaulted, has no further rights in Blackacre, so the lender may obtain summary eviction.\nC. The attempted security arrangement is a creature unknown to the law, hence a nullity; the lender has only a personal right to $55,000 from the owner.\nD. The lender may bring whatever foreclosure proceeding is appropriate under the laws of the jurisdiction.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The lender does not own Blackacre outright; he holds an equitable mortgage. An equitable mortgage is created by the conveyance of an absolute deed as security for a loan, along with a promise by the grantee to reconvey the deed to the grantor once the loan is paid off. Because the lender's interest is a mortgage on the property rather than outright ownership of it, his only remedy following the owner's default is foreclosure of the property pursuant to the equitable mortgage, so answer D is correct. Answer A is incorrect because the agreement to reconvey is not a land sale contract and is therefore not subject to the Statute of Frauds. Answer B is incorrect because a court must determine the rights of a mortgagor and mortgagee in relation to a default on the mortgage, and the vehicle for that determination is a foreclosure proceeding, not an eviction proceeding. C is incorrect because the arrangement is an equitable mortgage, not a nullity.\n</s>"

Later, the owner conveyed Greenacre by warranty deed to a neighbor, who paid valuable consideration, knew nothing of the woman's claim, and promptly and properly recorded. Next, the woman recorded her deed. Then the neighbor conveyed Greenacre by quitclaim deed to her son as a gift. When the possible conflict with the woman was discovered, the son recorded his deed. Greenacre at all relevant times has been vacant unoccupied land. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" No other statute is applicable. The son has sued the woman to establish who owns Greenacre. The court will hold for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The son, because the woman was a donee.\nB.

The woman, because the son was a subsequent donee.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The recording act quoted in this question is a race-notice act. To prevail under a race-notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who: 1) was the first to record their deed (won the race), and 2) acquired the land without notice of earlier purchasers. To be a BFP, a party must give value for their interest in the land. The facts indicate that the neighbor recorded first, followed by the woman and then the son. The woman, however, gave no value for the conveyance; she received the conveyance as a gift. Therefore, she is not a BFP and is not protected by the recording statute. Further, by the time she recorded the deed, the neighbor had already recorded (The woman lost the race), and the neighbor's title was already better. The neighbor was the first BFP to record a purchase of the land, and as such she is protected by the recording act and her purchase cut off any rights that the woman may have had. Thus, when she gave the land to her son, she had already cut off the woman's rights, and the son has the better title.  Answer B is correct, and A, C, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

Two years ago, the banker died and left Eastgate to her nephew for life, with remainder to her godson, his heirs and assigns. The nephew was 30 years old and the godson was 20 years old when the banker died. The devise of Eastgate was made subject to any mortgage on Eastgate in effect at the time of the banker's death. When the banker executed her will, the balance of the mortgage debt on Eastgate was less than $5,000. A year before her death, the banker suffered financial reverses; and in order to meet her debts, she had mortgaged Eastgate to secure a loan of $150,000. The entire principal of the mortgage remained outstanding when she died. As a result, the net annual income from Eastgate was reduced not only by real estate taxes and regular maintenance costs, but also by the substantial mortgage interest payments that were due each month. The nephew was very dissatisfied with the limited benefit that he was receiving from the life estate. When, earlier this year, Acme, Inc., proposed to purchase Eastgate, demolish the building, pay off the mortgage, and construct a 30-story office building, the nephew was willing to accept Acme's offer. However, the godson adamantly refused the offer, even though he, as the remainderman, paid the principal portion of each monthly mortgage amortization payment. The godson was independently wealthy and wanted to convert Eastgate into a public park when he became entitled to possession. When Acme realized that the godson would not change his mind, Acme modified its proposal to a purchase of the life estate of the nephew. Acme was ready to go ahead with its building plans, relying upon a large life insurance policy on the nephew's life to protect it against the economic risk of his death. The nephew's life expectancy was 45 years. When the godson learned that the nephew had agreed to Acme's modified proposal, the godson brought an appropriate action against them to enjoin their carrying it out. There is no applicable statute. The best argument for the godson is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Acme cannot purchase the nephew's life estate, because life estates are not assignable.\nB. the proposed demolition of the building constitutes waste.\nC. the godson's payment of the mortgage principal has subrogated him to the nephew's rights as a life tenant and bars the nephew's assignment of the life estate without the godson's consent.\nD. continued existence of the one-story building is more in harmony with the ultimate use as a park than the proposed change in use.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The facts indicate that the nephew is a life tenant on the property, with the godson holding a vested remainder. A life tenant has a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste with respect to the property during their life tenancy. A failure to keep the property in repair, to pay taxes on the property, or pay interest on any mortgage on the property all constitute permissive waste. Voluntary waste, on the other hand, is an affirmative act that serves to somehow damage the land. This \"damage,\" however, is not necessarily an act that reduces the value of the land. For example, a life tenant's affirmative act of changing the basic use of the land during his tenancy would be characterized as \"damage\" to the land that constitutes voluntary waste even if the land value increased as a result. The life tenant is held liable to the remainderman for any waste during his or her life tenancy. In this case, the best argument available to the godson (of the choices given) is that building a 30 story building constitutes a change in use sufficient to establish voluntary waste, so answer B is the best choice.\n</s>"

Thereafter, one of the children died and by will duly admitted to probate devised his entire estate to a friend. The remaining two siblings were the deceased sibling's heirs at law. Later the wife died. In an appropriate lawsuit to which the two remaining siblings and the friend are parties, title to Purpleacre is at issue.

The two siblings and the friend, because the earliest vesting of remainders is favored and reference to the wife's death should be construed as relating to time of taking possession.\nB. The two siblings and the friend, because the provision requiring survival of children violates the Rule Against Perpetuities since the surviving wife might have been a person unborn at the time of writing of the will.\nC.

However, the remainder only exists in the children who were living at the time of the wife's death. Therefore, only the two remaining siblings held a remainder in Purpleacre. The deceased sibling's estate did not include a remainder in Purpleacre because he predeceased the farmer's wife, so the deceased sibling had no interest to bequeath to his friend. Therefore, answer D is correct, and answers A, B, and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

By warranty deed, she conveyed Goldacre in fee simple to her brother for a recited consideration of \"$10 and other valuable consideration.\" The deed was promptly and properly recorded. One week later, the woman and her brother executed a written document that stated that the conveyance of Goldacre was for the purpose of establishing a trust for the benefit of the woman's son. Her brother expressly accepted the trust and signed the document with the woman. This written agreement was not authenticated to be eligible for recordation and there never was an attempt to record it. The brother entered into possession of Goldacre and distributed the net income from Goldacre to his sister's son at appropriate intervals. Five years later, the brother conveyed Goldacre in fee simple to a friend by warranty deed. The friend paid the fair market value of Goldacre, had no knowledge of the written agreement between the brother and sister, and entered into possession of Goldacre. The woman's son made demand upon the friend for distribution of income at the next usual time income from the trust would have distributed. The friend refused. The son brought an appropriate action against the friend for a decree requiring her to perform the trust the brother had theretofore recognized. In such action, judgment should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The son, because a successor in title to the trustee takes title subject to the grantor's trust.\nB. The son, because equitable interests are not subject to the recording act.\nC. The friend, because, as a bona fide purchaser, she took free of the trust encumbering the brother's title.\nD. The friend, because no trust was ever created since the woman had no title at the time of the purported creation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The son will need to bring an action against the brother, not the friend. The brother accepted legal title in Goldacre as trust property, with equitable title in the son as beneficiary. A trust need not be written or recorded and the transaction of land and trust do not need to be contemporaneous to make the trust valid. Thus D is incorrect. The brother sold Goldacre to the friend, but the sale was not a transfer of his duties as trustee, only a sale of trust res. The brother is still the son's trustee. Thus A is incorrect. The friend purchased Goldacre for value, without notice of any encumbrances, and did not agree to assume the duties of trustee when she purchased. The son has no claim against a bona fide purchaser and must prosecute a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the brother, thus C is the best answer.\n</s>"

Her neighbor owned Whiteacre, an adjoining unimproved lot suitable for constructing a dwelling. The neighbor executed and delivered a deed granting to the doctor an easement over the westerly 15 feet of Whiteacre for convenient ingress and egress to a public street, although the doctor's lot did abut another public street. The doctor did not then record the neighbor's deed. After the doctor constructed and started using a driveway within the described 15-foot string in a clearly visible manner, the neighbor borrowed $10,000 cash from a bank and gave the bank a mortgage on Whiteacre. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The doctor then recorded the neighbor's deed granting the easement. The neighbor subsequently defaulted on her loan payments to the bank. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" In an appropriate foreclosure action as to Whiteacre, brought against the doctor and the neighbor, the bank seeks, among other things, to have the doctor's easement declared subordinate to the bank's mortgage, so that the easement will be terminated by completion of the foreclosure. If the doctor's easement is NOT terminated, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the recording of the deed granting the easement prior to the foreclosure action protects the doctor's rights.\nB. the easement provides access from Blackacre to a public street.\nC. the doctor's easement is appurtenant to Blackacre and thus cannot be separated from Blackacre.\nD. visible use of the easement by the doctor put the bank on notice of the easement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The recording statute identified in the facts is a notice act.

For the bank to be protected under the recording statute and prevail over the doctor, it must be able to establish that it recorded its interest without notice of her easement. Although the bank did not have record notice of the easement, since it had not yet been recorded when the mortgage was issued, the bank arguably had inquiry notice by virtue of the doctor's open and obvious use (and development) of the easement. Therefore, if the doctor prevails, it will be as a result of the bank's notice of the easement, and answer D is correct.\n</s>"

During the intermission between the first and second periods of a game, the hockey fan solicited signatures for a petition urging that the coach of the hockey team be fired. The local arena and hockey team are owned by a privately owned entity. As evidenced by many prominently displayed signs, this entity prohibits all solicitations anywhere within the arena at any time and in any manner. The privately owned entity notified the hockey fan to cease her solicitation of signatures. The hockey fan continued to seek signatures on her petition during the hockey team's next three home games at the arena. Each time, the entity notified the hockey fan to cease such solicitation. The hockey fan announced her intention to seek signatures on her petition again during the hockey team's next home game at the arena. The entity wrote a letter informing her that her season ticket was canceled and tendered a refund for the unused portion. The hockey fan refused the tender and brought an appropriate action to establish the right to attend all home games.

While the license may be revoked by the issuer, that issuer will be liable for damages if it does so wrongfully. Further, because the ticket is a contractual right, a ticket holder's remedy for wrongful revocation of a ticket will be in contract, rather than property law.

The corporation entered into a valid written contract to convey Blackacre to an individual buyer. At closing, the buyer paid the price in full and received an instrument in the proper form of a deed, signed by duly authorized corporate officers on behalf of the corporation, purporting to convey Blackacre to the buyer. The buyer did not then record the deed or take possession of Blackacre. Next, a man (who had no knowledge of the contract or the deed) obtained a substantial money judgment against the corporation. Then, the buyer recorded the deed from the corporation. Thereafter, the man properly filed the judgment against the corporation. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" Afterward, the buyer entered into a written contract to convey Blackacre to a developer. The developer objected to the buyer's title and refused to close.

The court should decide for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the developer, because the man's judgment was obtained before the buyer recorded the deed from the corporation.\nB. the developer, because even though the corporation's deed to the buyer prevented the man's judgment from being a lien on Blackacre, the man's filed judgment poses a threat of litigation.\nC. the buyer, because she recorded her deed before the man filed his judgment.\nD. the buyer, because she received the deed from the corporation before the man filed his judgment.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The recording statute identified in the facts is a notice act.

The facts state that the buyer, a BFP, received the deed from the corporation before the judgment was filed, which indicates she could not have had notice of it. She then recorded her deed, still having no notice of any judgments against the corporation. Her lack of notice means that she is protected against the man's subsequent claim to an interest in the property.

The principal asset of the trust has always been Blackacre, a very profitable, debt-free office building. The trust instrument instructs the trustee to pay the net income to the man for life, and, after the death of the man, to pay the net income to his wife for life; and, after her death, to distribute the net trust estate as she may appoint by will, or in default of her exercise of this power of appointment, to the man's son (the wife's stepson). The man died 30 years ago survived by his wife and son. The man had not revoked or amended the trust agreement. A few years after the man's death, his wife remarried. She then had a daughter, was widowed for a second time, and then died last year. Her will contained only one dispositive provision: \"I give my entire estate to my daughter, and I intentionally make no provision for my stepson.\" The daughter is now 22 years old. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. The stepson brought an appropriate action against the daughter to determine who was entitled to the net trust estate and thus to Blackacre. If the court rules for the daughter, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the wife's life estate and general power of appointment merge into complete ownership in the wife.\nB. the Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply to general powers of appointment.\nC. the jurisdiction deems \"entire estate\" to be a reference to Blackacre or to the wife's general power of appointment.\nD. the wife intended that her stepson should not benefit by reason of her death.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The fact pattern states that the wife was given a general power of testamentary \"appointment\" over the net trust estate of Blackacre. The use of that terminology created a specific power that could only be utilized in the wife's will. The issue is whether the wife appropriately exercised that power. Most jurisdictions require the language of the will to specifically refer to the exercise of the power, which the wife's does not do. Therefore, for the daughter to prevail, the court must find that the wife's general reference to her \"entire estate\" was a use of her power of appointment.\n</s>"

Three years ago, the landlord and a tenant agreed to a month-to-month tenancy with the tenant paying the landlord rent each month. After six months of the tenant's occupancy, the landlord suggested to the tenant that she could buy Blackacre for a monthly payment of no more than her rent. The landlord and the tenant orally agreed that the tenant would pay $25,000 in cash, the annual real estate taxes, the annual fire insurance premiums, and the costs of maintaining Blackacre, plus the monthly mortgage payments that the landlord owed on Blackacre. They further orally agreed that within six years the tenant could pay whatever mortgage balances were then due and the landlord would give her a warranty deed to the property. The tenant's average monthly payments did turn out to be the same as her monthly rent. The tenant fully complied with all of the obligations she had undertaken. She made some structural modifications to Blackacre. Blackacre is now worth 50% more than it was when the landlord and the tenant made their oral agreement. The tenant made her financing arrangements and was ready to complete the purchase of Blackacre, but the landlord refused to close. The tenant brought an appropriate action for specific performance against the landlord to enforce the agreement. The court should rule for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landlord, because the agreements were oral and violated the statute of frauds.\nB. The landlord, subject to the return of the $25,000, because the arrangement was still a tenancy.\nC. The tenant, because the doctrine of part performance applies.\nD. The tenant, because the statute of frauds does not apply to oral purchase and sale agreements between landlords and tenants in possession.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Although a contract for the sale of land normally requires a writing signed by the party to be charged, the doctrine of part performance creates an exception to that rule. The elements of the doctrine are 1) a definite and unambiguous oral contract, and 2) a performance by the putative buyer that clearly indicates that a contract existed. Performances that suffice to take the contract for the sale of real property out of the statute of frauds include a) making improvements to the property, b) paying the purchase price in full, and c) taking possession of the property. Any one of these performances, along with a clear and definite oral contract, will establish a contract through part performance. In this case, the terms and conditions of the oral contract are clear - the landlord does not deny those conditions; he simply refuses to comply with them. The tenant's possession of and improvements to the property are performances that indicate a contract existed - it is assumed a party would not make such performances in the absence of an agreement. Therefore, answer C is correct.\n</s>"

The lease provided that the tenant could sublet and assign. The tenant lived in Blackacre for one year and paid the rent promptly. After one year, the tenant leased Blackacre to a friend for one year at a rent of $1,000 per month. The friend took possession of Blackcare and lived there for six months but, because of her unemployment, paid no rent. After six months, on June 30 the friend abandoned Blackacre, which remained vacant for the balance of that year. The tenant again took possession of Blackacre at the beginning of the third and final year of the term but paid the owner no rent. At the end of the lease term, the owner brought an appropriate action against both the tenant and the friend to recover $24,000, the unpaid rent. In such action the owner is entitled to a judgment\nAnswer Choices:\nA. against the tenant individually for $24,000, and no judgment against the friend.\nB. against the tenant individually for $18,000, and against the friend individually for $6,000.\nC. against the tenant for $12,000, and against the tenant and the friend jointly and severally for $12,000.\nD. against the tenant individually for $18,000, and against the tenant and the friend jointly and severally for $6,000.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n This question requires you to distinguish between an assignment and a sublease. An assignment of a lease by a tenant occurs where the tenant transfers all his rights and duties under a lease to another party (an \"assignee\") for the entire length of time remaining on the lease. By contrast, a sublease is a transfer by a tenant to another party (a \"sublessee\") for a time period shorter than the time remaining on the lease. In this case, the facts indicate that the tenant transferred the unit to the friend for a limited time, specifically, months 13 through 24 of the tenant's lease from the owner. This means that the friend was merely a sublessee rather than an assignee. A sublessee has no liability in relation to the original landlord, because there is neither privity of contract nor privity of estate between those parties. Therefore, only the tenant is liable to the owner for the 24 months of rent that have not been paid. Therefore, answer A is correct, and answers B, C, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

His neighbor owned the adjoining Lot 2 in the same subdivision. The plat of the subdivision was recorded as authorized by statute. Twelve years ago, the landowner erected an industrial building wholly situated on Lot 1 but with one wall along the boundary common with Lot 2. The construction was done as authorized by a building permit, validly obtained under applicable statutes, ordinances, and regulations. Further, the construction was regularly inspected and passed as being in compliance with all building code requirements. Lot 2 remained vacant until six months ago, when the neighbor began excavation pursuant to a building permit authorizing the erection of an industrial building situated on Lot 2 but with one wall along the boundary common with Lot 1. The excavation caused subsidence of a portion of Lot 1 that resulted in injury to the landowner's building. The excavation was not done negligently or with any malicious intent to injure. In the jurisdiction, the time to acquire title by adverse possession or rights by prescription is 10 years. The landowner brought an appropriate action against the neighbor to recover damages resulting from the injuries in the building on Lot 1. In such lawsuit, judgment should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landowner, if, but only if, the subsidence would have occurred without the weight of the building on Lot 1.\nB. The landowner, because a right for support, appurtenant to Lot 1, had been acquired by adverse possession or prescription.\nC. The neighbor, because Lots 1 and 2 are urban land, as distinguished from rural land and, therefore, under the circumstances the landowner had the duty to protect any improvements on Lot 1.\nD. The neighbor, because the construction and the use to be made of the building were both authorized by the applicable law.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A landowner has the right to lateral (side) support of its land from all neighboring parcels of land. This right, however, extends only to the land itself, not the structures built upon it. This means that if a landowner excavates its own land, and collapse of the neighboring land and a structure built on that land occurs, the excavating landowner is liable only if the neighboring land would have collapsed even without the weight of the structure. In other words, the excavator must leave just enough support in place that the neighboring land without any structures on it would not collapse. If judgment is entered for the landowner, it will be because he established that the subsidence on Lot 1 would have occurred even without the weight of the landowner's building, so answer A is correct.\n</s>"

Fourteen years ago, the landlord, who had taken possession of Blackacre, leased Blackacre to a tenant for a term of 15 years at the monthly rent of $500. Eleven years ago, the landlord died intestate leaving her son as her sole heir. The tenant regularly paid rent to the landlord and, after the landlord's death, to the son until last month. The period in which to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. In an appropriate action, the tenant, the original owner, and the son each asserted ownership of Blackacre. The court should hold that title in fee simple is in\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the original owner, because the owner held a reversion and the landlord has died.\nB. the son, because the landlord asserted a claim adverse to the owner when the landlord executed a lease to the tenant.\nC. the son, because the tenant's occupation was attributable to the son, and the landlord died 11 years ago.\nD. the tenant, because of the tenant's physical occupancy and because the tenant's term ended with the landlord's death.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The interest that the original owner conveyed to the landlord was a life estate. As such, any right the landlord (or her assigns) had in the property ended upon her death. The son, having no legal right to the owner's property after the landlord's death, collected rent on that property from the tenant for eleven years. The son's actions have earned him an ownership interest in the property through adverse possession. To obtain land through adverse possesion, a party must for the length of the statutory period: 1) have actual physical possession or occupancy of the land, 2) maintain that possession continuously and without interruption, 3) exclude others from possession, 4) have \"hostile\" possession (be there without permission), and 5) maintain \"open and notorious\" possession. In this case, the son held the property without permission, did so exclusively, openly and notoriously (by allowing his tenant but no other parties to physically possess that land and pay him rent), and did so without interruption for the length of the statutory period (which in this jurisdiction is ten years).\n</s>"

The landowner executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Greenacre to a purchaser in fee simple. The instrument recited that the conveyance was in consideration of \"$5 in hand paid and for other good and valuable consideration.\" The landowner handed the instrument to the purchaser and the purchaser promptly and properly recorded it. Two months later, the landowner brought an appropriate action against the purchaser to cancel the instrument and to quiet title. In support, the landowner proved that no money in fact had been paid by the purchaser, notwithstanding the recitation, and that no other consideration of any kind had been supplied by the purchaser. In such action, landowner should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. lose, because any remedy the landowner might have had was lost when the instrument was recorded.\nB. lose, because the validity of conveyance of land does not depend upon consideration being paid, whether recited or not.\nC. prevail, because the recitation of consideration paid may be contradicted by parol evidence.\nD. prevail, because recordation does not make a void instrument effective.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The only requirements that must be met for a conveyance of land to be valid (and thereby transfer legal title in that land from one party to another) are execution and delivery of the deed. The execution requirement is satisfied as long as the deed is signed by the party to be charged (the seller). Delivery of a deed is established by a proven intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. In this case, the landowner signed the deed, and clearly intended for it to be delivered to the purchaser, as evidenced by the landowner's physical delivery of it. As such, the purchaser will prevail, and answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The banker and a buyer entered into a written agreement under which the buyer agreed to buy Goldacre for $100,000, its fair market value. The agreement contained all the essential terms of a real estate contract to sell and buy, including a date for closing. The required $50,000 down payment was made. The contract provided that in the event of the buyer's breach, the banker could retain the $50,000 deposit as liquidated damages. Before the date set for the closing in the contract, the buyer died. On the day that the administratrix of the buyer's estate was duly qualified, which was after the closing date, the administratrix made demand for return of the $50,000 deposit. The banker responded by stating that she took such demand to be a declaration that the administratrix did not intend to complete the contract and that the banker considered the contract at an end. The banker further asserted that she was entitled to retain, as liquidated damages, the $50,000. The reasonable market value of Goldacre had increased to $110,000 at that time. The administratrix brought an appropriate action against the banker to recover $50,000. In answer, the banker made no affirmative claim but asserted that she was entitled to retain the $50,000 as liquidated damages as provided in the contract. In such lawsuit, judgment should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the administratrix, because the provision relied upon by the banker is unenforceable.\nB. the administratrix, because the death of the buyer terminated the contract as a matter of law.\nC. the banker, because the court should enforce the express agreement of the contracting parties.\nD. the banker, because the doctrine of equitable conversion prevents termination of the contract upon the death of a party.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A seller is entitled to keep a buyer's deposit as liquidated damages following the buyer's breach of the contract, as long as that amount appears to be reasonable in light of the seller's anticipated and actual damages. Many courts will uphold the retention of a deposit of 10% of the sale price or less without inquiry to its reasonableness. The facts indicate that the sale price of Goldacre was set at the \"reasonable market value,\" which was $100,000 at the time of contracting and had increased to $110,000 by the time set for closing. Therefore, the banker did not have actual damages, because she can sell it for $10,000 more, and the most the banker can legally retain is $11,000. Thus, she will not be able to enforce a liquidated damages clause in any higher amount. The administratrix has not sought specific performance of the contract, so the only issue being considered by the court is liquidated damages, so answer A is correct. Answer D is incorrect because the banker is not seeking to prevent termination of the contract (through specific performance); she is merely seeking damages. \n</s>"

Two weeks later, the buyer paid the agreed price and received a warranty deed. A week thereafter, when neither contract nor deed had been recorded and while the owner remained in possession of Blackacre, a creditor properly filed a money judgment against the owner. She knew nothing of the buyer's interest. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\"\\ The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" The creditor brought an appropriate action to enforce her lien against Blackacre in the buyer's hands.

To prevail under a notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded her deed without notice of earlier purchasers. To be a BFP, a party must give value for her interest in the land. Although the facts indicate that the creditor filed her judgment without actual notice or record notice of the conveyance (it had not been recorded yet), the recording act in this jurisdiction protects purchasers for value, meaning BFP's. Therefore, if the buyer wins, it is most likely because the creditor was not a BFP, making answer B the correct choice.\n</s>"

She obtained a $50,000 loan from a bank and executed and delivered to the bank a promissory note and mortgage describing Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Upon payment of $10,000, the woman obtained a release of Lot 2 duly executed by the bank. She altered the instrument of release to include Lot 5 as well as Lot 2 and recorded it. The woman thereafter sold Lot 5 to an innocent purchaser for value. The bank discovered that the instrument of release had been altered and brought an appropriate action against the woman and the purchaser to set aside the release as it applied to Lot 5. The woman did not defend against the action, but the purchaser did. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" The court should rule for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the purchaser, because the bank was negligent in failing to check the recordation of the release.\nB. the purchaser, because she was entitled to rely on the recorded release.\nC. the bank, because he purchaser could have discovered the alteration by reasonable inquiry.\nD. the bank, because the alteration of the release was ineffective.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The recording act quoted in this question is a race-notice act. To prevail under a race-notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who 1) was the first to record the deed (won the race), and 2) acquired the land without notice of earlier purchasers. Recording, however, is performed for the purpose of providing notice. It has no effect on the validity or invalidity of a deed. In this case, an invalid (forged) deed was recorded by the woman. The purchaser's lack of notice of the forgery and of any earlier purchasers is irrelevant to the validity of the deed. The invalid deed containing the forged release is ineffective, so answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The neighbor held record title in fee simple to Blueacre, which adjoined Greenacre. Twelve years ago the owner's son succeeded to the original owner's title in fee simple in Greenacre and seven years ago the neighbor's daughter succeeded to the neighbor's title in fee simple to Blueacre by a deed which made no mention of a right-of-way or driveway. At the time the neighbor's daughter took title, there existed a driveway across Greenacre which showed evidence that it had been used regularly to travel between the main roadand Blueacre. Blueacre did have frontage on a side road, but this means of access was seldom used because it was not as convenient to the dwelling situated on Blueacre as was the main road. The driveway originally was established by the neighbor. The neighbor's daughter has regularly used the driveway since acquiring title. The period of time required to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is ten years. Six months ago the son notified the neighbor's daughter that the son planned to develop a portion of Greenacre as a residential subdivision and that the daughter should cease any use of the driveway. After some negotiations, the son offered to permit the daughter to construct another driveway to connect with the streets of the proposed subdivision. The daughter declined this offer on the ground that travel from Blueacre to the main road would be more circuitous. The neighbor's daughter brought an appropriate action against the son to obtain a definitive adjudication of the respective rights of the daughter and the son. In such lawsuit the son relied upon the defense that the location of the easement created by the grant from the original owner to the neighbor was governed by reasonableness and that the son's proposed solution was reasonable. The son's defense should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. fail, because the location had been established by the acts of the neighbor and the original owner.\nB. fail, because the location of the easement had been fixed by prescription.\nC. prevail, because the reasonableness of the son's proposal was established by the neighbor's daughter's refusal to suggest any alternative location.\nD. prevail, because the servient owner is entitled to select the location of a right-of-way if the grant fails to identify its location.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The easement described in the facts is an easement appurtenant - one that benefits a specific piece of land. The creation of an easement appurtenant requires two pieces of property: a dominant estate and a servient one. This easement will automatically run with the land, and after being recorded for the first time does not need to be re-identified in any deeds accompanying later conveyances. The owner of the servient estate (the estate that the easement crosses) has the right to select the location of the easement. The only limit on such selection is that the location chosen must be a reasonable.In this case, the parties do not dispute whether the original owner of the servient estate reasonably chose its location. Instead, the son attempts to argue that moving the easement to a new location is permissible as long as the new location is selected reasonably. The easement, however, has already been reasonably located, and the servient estate does not possess any inherent right to relocate it. Therefore, answer A is correct.\n</s>"

The landowner had full knowledge of the mortgage transaction. The deed and mortgage were promptly and properly recorded in proper sequence. The mortgage, however, made no reference to the quoted language in the deed. Two years ago the niece converted her use of Blackacre from residential to commerical without the knowledge or consent of the landowner or of the bank. The niece's commercial venture failed, and the niece defaulted on her mortgage payments to the bank. Blackacre now has a fair market value of $25,000. The bank began appropriate foreclosure proceedings against the niece. The landowner properly intervened, tendered $1,000, and sought judgment that the niece and the bank be ordered to convey Blackacre to the landowner, free and clear of the mortgage. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute. If the court rules against the landowner, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the provision quoted from the deed violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. the bank had no actual knowledge of, and did not consent to, the violation of the covenant.\nC. the rights reserved by the landowner were subordinated, by necessary implication, to the rights of the bank as the lender of the purchase money.\nD. the consideration of $1,000 was inadequate.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The quoted provision violates the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP). The RAP applies to three types of interests: 1) vested remainders subject to open, 2) contingent remainders, and 3) executory interests. The Rule dictates that where any of these interests would vest outside of a life in being plus 21 years, it is void. Answering RAP questions is best accomplished in two parts: 1) identify the type of interests created by the language of the deed, and 2) if the interest is one of the three that the RAP applies to, determine whether it would be possible for that interest to vest any later than twenty-one years after everyone alive at the time of the conveyance has died. If it could, the interest is void.In this case, the facts indicate that if the property ever ceases to be used from nonresidential purposes, the landowner and/or his heirs have a right to repurchase, thus a contingent remainder. However, it could be decades before the land is used for nonresidential purposes, meaning it could be decades before the landowner and his heirs' interests can become possessory. Because it may be longer than a life in being plus 21 years before that occurs, the language of the grant violates the RAP, and answer A is correct. Answer B, C and D are all incorrect as the RAP provides a more sound basis to rule against the landowner than any of the concepts or doctrines these answers reference.\n</s>"

Three years ago, the widower executed and delivered to a buyer an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed, purporting to convey Blackacre to \"[the buyer].\" The child did not join in the deed. The buyer was and still is unmarried and childless. The only possibly applicable statute in the jurisdiction states that any deed will be construed to convey the grantor's entire estate, unless expressly limited. Last month, the widower died, never having remarried. His child is his only heir. Blackacre is now owned by\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the child, because the widower's death ended the buyer's life estate pur autre vie.\nB. the buyer in fee simple pursuant to the widower's deed.\nC. the child and the buyer as tenants in common of equal shares.\nD. the child and the buyer as joint tenants, because both survived the widower.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The owner conveyed Blackacre to the widower in fee simple. The language of the conveyance indicating that it was made to \"[the widower] and his heirs\" does not create an interest in the child. Because the widower holds the land in fee simple, his ownership will not be terminated by the happening of any subsequent condition, and he is free to transfer the land to whomever he wishes (there are no restraints on alienation). Because there are no restrictions on the widower's right to re-convey the land, his conveyance to the buyer in fee simple will be upheld, and the child has no rights in the property. Answers C and D may therefore be eliminated. Note that the widower could have given the child an interest if he wished to. For example, he could have conveyed the property \"to [the buyer]for life, then to the child and her heirs.\" Alternatively, if the widower had not conveyed to the buyer, the child would have simply inherited the property upon his death. The widower, however, held Blackacre in fee simple and was free to convey it as he wished, so answer B is correct. Answer A is incorrect because there is nothing in the facts indicating that the buyer had a life estate.\n</s>"

Subsequently, the church wanted to relocate and entered into a valid written contract to sell the land to a buyer for a substantial price. The buyer wanted to use the land as a site for business activities and objected to the church's title. The contract contained no provision relating to the quality of title the church was bound to convey. There is no applicable statute. When the buyer refused to close, the church sued the buyer for specific performance and properly joined the grantor as a party. Is the church likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the grantor's interest prevents the church's title from being marketable.\nB. No, because the quoted provision is a valid restrictive covenant.\nC.

The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating in pertinent part \" . . . , subject to a mortgage to [the partner],\" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage. The neighbor took possession of the land and made several mortgage payments, which the partner accepted. Now, however, neither the neighbor nor the investor has made the last three mortgage payments. The partner has sued the neighbor for the amount of the delinquent payments. In this action, for whom should the court render judgment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The neighbor, because she did not assume and agree to pay the investor's mortgage debt.\nB. The neighbor, because she is not in privity of estate with the partner.\nC. The partner, because the investor's deed to the neighbor violated the due-on-sale clause.\nD. The partner, because the neighbor is in privity of estate with the partner.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A grantee who does not assume the mortgage, but rather takes subject to the mortgage, is not personally liable for the debt. In this case, there was no express assumption. In fact, the parties agreed that the neighbor was not assuming the mortgage debt. The investor is the only party liable for the mortgage to the partner.\n</s>"

The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance. How should the $200,000 surplus arising from the bid on the parking garage be distributed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. It should be paid to the bank.\nB. It should be paid to the businessman.\nC. It should be paid to the financing company.\nD. It should be split equally between the bank and the financing company.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The foreclosure sale of the bank's mortgage on the hotel was insufficient to pay the businessman's debt to the bank. The bank had received a judgment against the businessman for the entire amount of the defaulted loan. This lien was properly recorded and applied to all property owned by the businessman during the ten-year time period, including the parking garage. (The bank may have decided on this course of action because it deemed the businessman's equity in the garage was significant and the timing was bad for a hotel foreclosure.) After the financing company was paid in full from the funds generated by the foreclosure sale of its mortgage on the parking garage, the additional funds generated by that sale would be paid to the bank not as a deficiency judgment, but because of the unsatisfied amount of the prior money judgment.\n</s>"

The recorded subdivision plan imposed no restrictions on any of the 10 lots. Within two months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to a buyer by a deed that contained no restriction on the lot's use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner, on behalf of himself as the owner of the unsold lot, and on behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on Lot 1. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The doctor, because Lot 1 was conveyed without the inclusion of the restrictive covenant in the deed to the first buyer and the subsequent deed to the doctor.\nB. The doctor, because zoning ordinances override private restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.\nC. The landowner, because the doctor, as a successor in interest to the first buyer, is estopped to deny that Lot 1 remains subject to the zoning ordinance as it existed when Lot 1 was first conveyed by the landowner to the first buyer.\nD. The landowner, because with the first buyer's knowledge of the facts, Lot 1 became incorporated into a common scheme.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n To be binding, a restrictive covenant must be placed on property at the time it is conveyed. Here, neither the deed to the first buyer nor the deed to the doctor contains the restrictive covenant. The burden cannot be attached to Lot 1 at a later time by someone who has no interest in Lot 1. Therefore, the doctor may proceed with her plan to use part of the property as a medical office.\n</s>"

The contract made no mention of the quality of title to be conveyed. Thereafter, the seller and the investor completed the sale, and the seller delivered a warranty deed to the investor. Soon thereafter, the value of the land increased dramatically. The investor entered into a written contract to sell the land to a buyer. The contract between the investor and the buyer expressly provided that the investor would convey a marketable title. The buyer's attorney discovered that the title to the land was not marketable, and had not been marketable when the original seller conveyed to the investor. The buyer refused to complete the sale. The investor sued the original seller on multiple counts. One count was for breach of the contract between the seller and the investor for damages resulting from the seller's failure to convey to the investor marketable title, resulting in the loss of the sale of the land to the subsequent buyer. Who is likely to prevail on this count?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The investor, because the law implies in the contract a covenant that the title would be marketable.\nB. The investor, because the original seller is liable for all reasonably foreseeable damages.\nC. The original seller, because her contract obligations as to title merged into the deed.\nD.

Two persons signed as witnesses to qualify the deed for recordation under an applicable statute. The homeowner handed the deed to his nephew's friend and said, \"I want [the nephew] to have my home. Please take this deed for him.\" Shortly thereafter, the nephew's friend learned that the homeowner's death was imminent. One day before the homeowner's death, the nephew's friend recorded the deed. The nephew returned home shortly after the homeowner's death. The nephew's friend brought him up to date, and he took possession of the home. The homeowner died intestate, leaving a daughter as his sole heir. She asserted ownership of his home. The nephew brought an appropriate action against her to determine title to the home. The law of the jurisdiction requires only two witnesses for a will to be properly executed. If the court rules for the nephew and against the daughter, what is the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The deed was delivered when the homeowner handed it to the nephew's friend.\nB.

The man received a loan, secured by a mortgage on the property, from a bank. Later, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank then brought an appropriate action to foreclose the mortgage, was the sole bidder at the judicial sale, and received title to the property as a result of the foreclosure sale. Shortly after the foreclosure sale, the man received a substantial inheritance. He approached the bank to repurchase the property, but the bank decided to build a branch office on the property and declined to sell. If the man prevails in an appropriate action to recover title to the property, what is the most likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. He had used the property as his residence.\nB. He timely exercised an equitable right of redemption.\nC. The court applied the doctrine of exoneration.\nD. The jurisdiction provides for a statutory right of redemption.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n If the man recovers title to the property, it would be because the jurisdiction provides a statutory right of redemption. A jurisdiction may, by statute, provide a statutory right of redemption, which sets out an additional time period after the foreclosure sale during which the prior mortgagor and perhaps others have the option to pay a certain sum of money and redeem the title to the property. The right arises only by statute and only after there has been a foreclosure of the mortgage. If the jurisdiction provides a statutory right of redemption, it does not matter whether the property being redeemed is residential, commercial, or another type of property, unless the statute so notes. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer A is incorrect.\n</s>"

The contract stated, \"The parties agree that closing will occur on next May 1 at 10 a.m.\" There was no other reference to closing. The contract was silent as to quality of title. On April 27, the seller notified the buyer that she had discovered that the land was subject to a longstanding easement in favor of a corporation for a towpath for a canal, should the corporation ever want to build a canal. The buyer thought it so unlikely that a canal would be built that the closing should occur notwithstanding this outstanding easement. Therefore, the buyer notified the seller on April 28 that he would expect to close on May 1. When the seller refused to close, the buyer sued for specific performance. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the easement renders the seller's title unmarketable.\nB. No, because rights of third parties are unresolved.\nC. Yes, because the decision to terminate the contract for title not being marketable belongs only to the buyer.\nD. Yes, because the seller did not give notice of the easement a reasonable time before the closing date.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n If a contract of sale is silent as to quality of title, the court will imply a marketable title, and an easement does affect the marketability of title.

The buyer may waive the right to have a marketable title, which is what the buyer did in this fact situation. Thus, Answer C is correct.\n</s>"

The applicable zoning ordinance required that a buildable lot contain at least two acres and have frontage of not less than 100 feet on a public street. A brother and sister owned the land as tenants in common, the brother owning a one-third interest and the sister owning a two-thirds interest. Neither of them owned any other real property. The sister brought an appropriate action to partition the land and proposed that a two-acre rectangular lot with 100 feet of frontage be set off to her and that a one-acre rectangular lot with 50 feet of frontage be set off to the brother. The brother's defense included a demand that the land be sold and its proceeds be divided one-third to the brother and two-thirds to the sister. Who will prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The brother, because partition by sale is the preferred remedy, unless a fair price is not the likely result of a sale.\nB. The brother, because the zoning ordinance makes it impossible to divide the land fairly.\nC.

Partition in kind, in which there is a physical division of the common property, is preferred; however, a partition by sale is allowed when a fair and equitable physical division of the property is impossible. The applicable zoning ordinance requires a frontage of 100 feet on a public street in order to build. Although the subject property can be physically divided, it would not be fair or equitable to convey only 50 feet of frontage to the brother, who then could not build on his lot.

The man retained the rear five-acre portion of the land and continues to live there in a large farmhouse. The deed to the 40-acre tract was promptly and properly recorded. It contained the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this deed, which shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on all owners, their heirs and assigns, that no use shall be made of the 40-acre tract of land except for residential purposes.\" Subsequently, the developer fully developed the 40-acre tract into a residential subdivision consisting of 40 lots with a single-family residence on each lot. Although there have been multiple transfers of ownership of each of the 40 lots within the subdivision, none of them included a reference to the quoted provision in the deed from the man to the developer, nor did any deed to a subdivision lot create any new covenants restricting use. Last year, a major new medical center was constructed adjacent to the subdivision. A doctor who owns a house in the subdivision wishes to relocate her medical offices to her house. For the first time, the doctor learned of the restrictive covenant in the deed from the man to the developer. The applicable zoning ordinance permits the doctor's intended use. The man, as owner of the five-acre tract, however, objects to the doctor's proposed use of her property. There are no governing statutes other than the zoning code. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. Can the doctor convert her house in the subdivision into a medical office?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the owners of lots in the subdivision own property benefitted by the original residential covenant and have the sole right to enforce it.\nB. No, because the man owns property benefitted by the original restrictive covenant and has a right to enforce it.\nC. Yes, because the original restrictive covenant violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nD. Yes, because the zoning ordinance allows the doctor's proposed use and preempts the restrictive covenant.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The restrictive covenant created 25 years ago placed a burden on the 40-acre tract of land and gave the right to enforce the promise to the man who retained the ownership of the benefitted five-acre tract of land. The man may enforce the promise because he owns the benefitted tract of land. It may be that the owners in the subdivision also may enforce the promise; however, the man, as owner of the original benefitted five-acre tract of land, also may enforce it. Thus, Answer B is correct and Answer A is incorrect. Answer D is incorrect. The zoning ordinance does allow the doctor's proposed use. The zoning ordinance does not, however, preempt the valid restrictive covenant. The restrictive covenant, as the more restrictive of the two in terms of its limitations, prevails.\n</s>"

The friend neglected to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was then $25,000. Three years ago, the investor discovered that the friend had not recorded his mortgage and in consideration of $50,000 conveyed the lot to a buyer. The fair market value of the lot was then $50,000. The buyer knew nothing of the friend's mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot. Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her bank of the mortgage claimed by the investor's friend, the bank loaned her $15,000, and she gave the bank a note for $15,000 due in two years secured by a mortgage on the lot. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. At that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" Both notes are now due and both the investor and the buyer have refused to pay. The lot is now worth only $50,000. What are the rights of the investor's friend and the bank in the lot?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both mortgages are enforceable liens and the friend's has priority because it was first recorded.\nB. Both mortgages are enforceable liens, but the bank's has priority because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for value.\nC. Only the friend's mortgage is an enforceable lien, because the bank had actual and constructive notice of the investor's fraud.\nD. Only the bank's mortgage is an enforceable lien, because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for value.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The friend does not have an enforceable lien. The friend did have a lien on the lot when the investor granted the friend a mortgage. The friend, however, did not record the mortgage. The investor then sold the lot to the buyer. The buyer had no actual notice of the mortgage to the friend. The buyer had no notice based on possession because the lot was vacant. The buyer had no constructive notice of the mortgage because the mortgage to the friend had not been recorded when the buyer received title. The lot is located in a notice jurisdiction. The fact that the buyer was an innocent purchaser for value at the time the buyer received title qualifies the buyer for protection in a notice jurisdiction. The buyer took the lot free of any prior unrecorded documents; specifically, the friend's mortgage. The fact that the friend later recorded the mortgage is irrelevant in a notice jurisdiction--the notice given to the buyer was given too late. The bank's mortgage is an enforceable lien. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answers A, B, and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

The two tracts were a mile apart. Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of both properties and identifications of the parties, the following: I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the grantee and his heirs and assigns shall have the right to purchase the larger tract for its fair market value as determined by a board consisting of three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers. With appropriate references to the other property and the parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred upon the grantor and her heirs and assigns a similar right to purchase the smaller tract, purportedly binding the grantee and his heirs and assigns. Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring the larger tract and by an appropriate written document released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had in the larger tract. Last year, the grantee died. The smaller tract passed by the grantee's will to his daughter. She has decided to sell the smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to sell the smaller tract to the corporation even though she has offered it for sale in the local real estate market. The corporation brought an appropriate action for specific performance after taking all of the necessary preliminary steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller tract. The daughter asserted all possible defenses. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. The grantee's release 10 years ago operates as a waiver regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might have.\nC. The two tracts of land were not adjacent parcels of real estate, and thus the right to purchase is in gross and is therefore unenforceable.\nD. Noncompliance with a right to purchase gives rise to a claim for money damages, but not for specific performance.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Fifteen years ago each of the parties granted a reciprocal right of first refusal (or a preemptive right) to the other. A right of first refusal is a conditional option. It provides that if the owner ever decides to sell the property, the one holding the right of first refusal has the right to purchase it. In this case, the price for the purchase was to be set by three qualified expert independent real estate appraisers and was thus fair. The right, however, violates the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. The right to purchase is triggered by the decision of one to sell his or her land. In this case, that decision might occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the right was granted. Thus, under the common law, the right of first refusal is struck ab initio. The question notes that the common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in this jurisdiction. Thus, there are no applicable statutory reforms to the rule, and because the question is written with the daughter winning, any statute which may exempt a commercial transaction is inapplicable. Thus, Answer A is correct.\n</s>"

After the mother's death and with the daughter's permission, the son took sole possession of the farm and agreed to pay the daughter a stipulated monthly rent. Several years later, the son defaulted on a personal loan, and his creditor obtained a judgment against him for $30,000. The creditor promptly and properly filed the judgment. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" Six months later, the son died. There are no other applicable statutes. Is the creditor entitled to enforce its judgment lien against the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the daughter became sole owner of the farm free and clear of the creditor's judgment lien when the son died.\nB. No, because the son's interest was severed from the daughter's interest upon the filing of the lien.\nC. Yes, because a joint tenancy cannot be created by devise, and the son died owning a 50% undivided interest in the farm as a tenant in common.\nD. Yes, because the son died owning a 50% undivided interest in the farm as a joint tenant with the daughter.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n A joint tenancy with right of survivorship can be created by devise or by conveyance provided the intent to create a right of survivorship is expressly stated, and in this case the mother's devise included express words of survivorship.

Twenty years ago, the businesswoman conveyed the vacant tract to a grantee by a warranty deed that the businesswoman signed but the grantee did not. The deed contained a covenant by the grantee as owner of the vacant tract that neither he nor his heirs or assigns would \"erect any building\" on the vacant tract, in order to preserve the view of the river from the commercial building on the improved tract. The grantee intended to use the vacant tract as a nature preserve. The grantee promptly and properly recorded the deed. Last year, the businesswoman conveyed the improved tract to a businessman. A month later, the grantee died, devising all of his property, including the vacant land, to his cousin. Six weeks ago, the cousin began construction of a building on the vacant tract. The businessman objected and sued to enjoin construction of the building. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The businessman, because the commercial building was constructed before the cousin began his construction project.\nB. The businessman, because the cousin is bound by the covenant made by the grantee.\nC. The cousin, because an equitable servitude does not survive the death of the promisor.\nD. The cousin, because the grantee did not sign the deed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The businesswoman and the grantee created a valid equitable servitude. The promise was in a writing--the deed--that satisfied the statute of frauds. The promise restricting the use of the vacant land touched and concerned the land, placing a burden on the vacant tract and giving a benefit to the improved tract. The writing showed an intent that the promise would be binding on the grantee's heirs and assigns. The grantee recorded the deed. The cousin had constructive notice of the equitable servitude and is bound by it because nothing has occurred that would terminate the equitable servitude. Thus, Answer B is correct. Answer A is incorrect because, although it correctly concludes that the businessman will prevail, it misstates the rationale. It is not relevant whether the commercial building was constructed before or after the other building.\n</s>"

The seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement for the sale of a portion of the tract identified only as \"a parcel of land, containing not less than 100 acres and having not less than 1,000 feet of frontage on the county highway, whose exact location and dimensions are to be determined by the parties hereto, at a price of $8,000 per acre.\" Shortly after the execution of the agreement, the parties met to stake out the parcel of land to be sold, but they could not agree. The disagreement intensified, and the seller repudiated the contract.  The buyer has sued the seller for specific performance. The seller has asserted all available defenses. Is the buyer entitled to specific performance of the contract?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a contract for the sale of real property that requires further agreement on an essential element cannot be specifically enforced.\nB. No, because the purchase price was not fixed by, nor determinable under, the contract terms.\nC. Yes, because the contract bound the parties to act in good faith and to agree upon the specific land to be conveyed.\nD. Yes, because the equity powers of the court enable the court to appoint a master, or to take other appropriate action, to identify the land to be conveyed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The statute of frauds requires a writing evidencing an agreement to sell real property to identify the land to be sold. Although courts are sometimes lenient with this requirement, the writing must contain some evidence of the specific real property to be sold. The writing in this case noted that the parties were yet to agree on what land was to be conveyed. Equity cannot provide relief for this omission, and the statute of frauds makes the contract unenforceable. Answer A is correct and Answers C and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

In her will, she devised a farm she owned to her husband for life, remainder to her niece. Her will did not specify the duties of the husband and the niece with regard to maintenance and expenses related to the farm. The husband took sole possession of the farm, did not farm the land, and did not rent the land to a third person, although the fair rental value was substantial. For two years in a row after the woman died, the county assessor sent the tax bills to the niece, but the niece did not pay the bills, because she and the husband could not agree on who should pay them. Finally, the niece paid the taxes to avoid a tax foreclosure sale. The niece then sued the husband for reimbursement for the two years' worth of property taxes.  There is no applicable statute.  Is the niece likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because remaindermen are solely responsible for the payment of property taxes.\nB. No, because the county assessor sent the bills to the niece.\nC. No, because the woman's will was silent on responsibility for payment of property taxes.\nD. Yes, because the niece paid an obligation that was the sole responsibility of the husband.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n In the absence of a contrary direction in the document creating the life estate--in this case, the will--it is the duty of the life tenant to pay all general property taxes that accrue during the continuance of the life estate. The only limitation on this duty is that the life tenant has no duty to expend more than the income that can be generated from the land. Because the fair rental value of the farmland was substantial, this limitation does not apply. If the remainderman does pay any property taxes due during the life tenancy, he or she is entitled to a judgment against the life tenant for reimbursement. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because it is not relevant to whom the county assessor sent the tax bills. Answer C is incorrect because the silence in her will as to the responsibility to pay the property taxes triggers the default rule--it is the duty of the life tenant to pay all general property taxes that accrue during the continuance of the life estate.\n</s>"

Several years later, she executed a mortgage on the lot to a bank to secure repayment of a $100,000 loan. Subsequently, the woman executed a mortgage on the same four-acre lot to a finance company to secure repayment of a $50,000 loan. Both mortgages were promptly recorded. The woman recently defaulted on both loans. The bank promptly initiated foreclosure proceedings and sent proper notice to all necessary parties. The current fair market value of the four-acre lot is $250,000. The finance company has filed a timely motion in the foreclosure proceeding asking the court to require the bank to first foreclose on two of the four acres in the four-acre lot. The bank opposes this motion and insists that it has the right to subject the entire four-acre lot to the foreclosure sale. Will the court grant the finance company's motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the bank holds a purchase-money mortgage.\nB. No, because the entire four-acre lot is subject to the bank's senior mortgage.\nC. Yes, because a pro rata foreclosure of the lot will not prejudice the rights of the bank.\nD. Yes, because of the \"two funds\" rule of marshalling.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Both mortgagees have mortgages on the entire four-acre lot. The bank has no obligation to foreclose on a smaller parcel. Further, a pro rata foreclosure might well prejudice the rights of the bank, since the two mortgages do not cover different tracts of land. Priority of mortgages in the foreclosure process is based on the order in which the mortgages were recorded. The bank's mortgage was recorded first and thus has priority.

The contract contained no contingencies. The seller was killed in a car accident before the parcel was conveyed, but the closing eventually took place with the conveyance by a deed from the personal representative of the seller's estate.  The personal representative of the seller's estate wants to distribute the proceeds of the real property sale. The seller's will was executed many years ago and was duly admitted to probate. Paragraph 5 of his will leaves all of the seller's real property to his son, and Paragraph 6 leaves the residue of the estate to the seller's daughter. No other provisions of the will are pertinent to the question regarding to whom the proceeds of the sale should be distributed. What will determine who receives the proceeds?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Whether Paragraph 5 refers specifically to the parcel of real property that was sold or simply to \"all of my real property.\"\nB. Whether the closing date originally specified in the contract was a date before or after the seller's death.\nC. Whether the jurisdiction has adopted the doctrine of equitable conversion.\nD.

If the seller dies during this time period leaving a will that devises the real estate to one person and the personalty to another, and if the contract contained no contingencies or all contingencies had been satisfied at the time of the death, the doctrine of equitable conversion applies. The determination of who will receive the proceeds thus depends on who had equitable title. In this case, the son had only a legal interest in the land at the time of the seller's death, and the daughter had the equitable interest in the proceeds and should receive them. Thus, Answer C is correct.\n</s>"

At a time when Goldacre was in the adverse possession of a stranger, the man's neighbor obtained the oral permission of the man to use as a road or driveway a portion of Goldacre to reach adjoining land, Twin Pines, which the neighbor owned in fee simple. Thereafter, during all times relevant to this problem, the neighbor used this road across Goldacre regularly for ingress and egress between Twin Pines and a public highway. The stranger quit possession of Goldacre before acquiring title by adverse possession. Without any further communication between the man and the neighbor, the neighbor continued to use the road for a total period, from the time he first began to use it, sufficient to acquire an easement by prescription. The man then blocked the road and refused to permit its continued use. The neighbor brought suit to determine his right to continue use of the road. The neighbor should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. win, because his use was adverse to the stranger's and once adverse it continued adverse until some affirmative showing of a change.\nB. win, because the neighbor made no attempt to renew permission after the stranger quit possession of Goldacre.\nC. lose, because his use was with permission.\nD. lose, because there is no evidence that he continued adverse use for the required period after the stranger quit possession.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The neighbor had the man's express permission to use the road, so that use was never adverse. The neighbor incorrectly argues that he has acquired an easement by prescription. To establish an easement by prescription, a party must show: 1) adverse, 2) continuous, 3) visible, and 4) unpermitted use of the area for the length of the statutory time period. Although the neighbor's use was continuous, visible, and lasted for the length of the statutory time period, that use was not adverse or unpermitted. Answers A and D are incorrect because the neighbor's use was not adverse. Answer B is incorrect because the man's original grant of permission was enough; it does not ever need to be renewed.\n</s>"

One of the contract provisions was that after closing, the seller had the right to remain in residence at Blackacre for up to 30 days before delivering possession to the buyer. The closing took place as scheduled. Title passed to the buyer and the seller remained in possession. Within a few days after the closing, the new house next door that was being constructed for the seller was burned to the ground, and at the end of the 30-day period the seller refused to move out of Blackacre; instead, he tendered to the buyer a monthly rental payment in excess of the fair rental value of Blackacre. The buyer rejected the proposal and that day brought an appropriate action to gain immediate possession of Blackacre. The contract was silent as to the consequences of the seller's failure to give up possession within the 30-day period, and the jurisdiction in which Blackacre is located has no statute dealing directly with this situation, although the landlord-tenant law of the jurisdiction requires a landlord to give a tenant 30 days notice before a tenant may be evicted. The buyer did not give the seller any such 30-day statutory notice. The buyer's best legal argument in support of his action to gain immediate possession is that the seller is a\nAnswer Choices:\nA. trespasser ab initio.\nB. licensee.\nC. tenant at sufferance.\nD. tenant from month to month.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The buyer's best legal argument is that the seller is a mere licensee who does not hold any property rights with regard to Blackacre. A license is a contractual right to use land that is owned by another party. Because it is a contractual right rather than a property right, the owner of the property is free to terminate or revoke that license at any time. While the licensee may have contractual remedies available to her where a wrongful revocation occurs, these do not affect the property rights of the owner. Therefore, answer B represents the buyer's best argument.\n</s>"

He obtained governmental approval (as required by applicable ordinances) and, between 1998 and 2000, he sold 140 of the lots, inserting in each of the 140 deeds the following provision: \"The grantee, for himself and his heirs, assigns and successors, covenants and agrees that the premises conveyed herein shall have erected thereon one single-family dwelling and that no other structure (other than a detached garage, normally incident to a single-family dwelling) shall be erected or maintained; and, further, that no use shall ever be made or permitted to be made other than occupancy by a single family for residential purposes only.\" Because of difficulty encountered in selling the remaining lots for single family use, in January 2001, the owner advertised the remaining lots with prominent emphasis: \"These lots are not subject to any restriction and purchasers will find them adaptable to a wide range of uses.\" A buyer had purchased one of the 140 lots and brought suit against the owner to establish that the remaining 185 lots, as well as the 140 sold previously, can be used only for residential purposes by single families. Assuming that procedural requirements have been met to permit adjudication of the issue the buyer has raised, which of the following is the most appropriate comment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The owner should win because the provision binds only the grantee.\nB. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\nC. The outcome turns on whether there are sufficient land areas devoted to multiple-family uses within the municipality to afford reasonable opportunity for all economic classes to move into the area so as to satisfy the standards of equal protection of the law.\nD. The buyer should win under an application of the doctrine which requires construction of deeds to resolve any doubt against the grantor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The restrictions described in the facts constitute equitable servitudes. An equitable servitude in a deed is only enforceable where a party can establish: 1) intent for the restriction to be enforceable by subsequent grantees, 2) that the subsequent grantee had notice of the servitude, and 3) the restriction touches and concerns the land. In this case, the facts indicate that all three elements can be established. The express language of the deeds indicates the restriction is intended to bind subsequent grantees. The recording of those deeds would provide later purchasers with record notice of the restriction. And a restriction on what can be built on the land clearly meets the requirement that the restriction touch and concern that land, so an enforceable equitable servitude was created. For an equitable servitude to bind an entire subdivision, however, it must be found in the common building plan for that subdivision. If it is, then anyone who owns a plot of land within the subdivision is bound by the restrictions, and may file suit to enforce those restrictions against other owners.\n</s>"

Included in the deed to each unit was a covenant under which the grantee's \"heirs and assigns\" agreed to purchase electrical power only from a plant the realty company promised to build and maintain within the development. The realty company constructed the plant and necessary power lines. The plant did not supply power outside the development. An appropriate and fair formula was used to determine price. After constructing and selling 12,500 of the units, the realty company sold its interest in the development to an investor company. The investor company operated the power plant and constructed and sold the remaining 12,500 units. Each conveyance from the investor company contained the same covenant relating to electrical power that the realty company had included in the 12,500 conveyances it had made. A woman bought a dwelling unit from a man, who had purchased it from the realty company. Subsequently, the woman, whose lot was along the boundary of the development, ceased buying electrical power from the investor company and began purchasing power from General Power company, which provided such service in the area surrounding the development. Both General Power and the investor company have governmental authorization to provide electrical services to the area. The investor company instituted an appropriate action against the woman to enjoin her from obtaining electrical power from General Power.

In this case, the facts clearly indicate that there was an intent for the restriction to be enforceable, and that the language of the deeds put subsequent grantees on notice. The restriction, however, does not touch and concern the land; it does not serve to make the land more useful or valuable in any way. Therefore, the restriction will not bind the woman, and answer A is correct.\n</s>"

Without the businessman's knowledge, a nearby farmer entered Brownacre in 1980 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse. The earthen dam trapped water that the farmer used to water a herd of cattle he owned. After twelve years of possession of Brownacre, the farmer gave possession of Brownacre to his oldest son. At the same time, the farmer also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to his son by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property. One year later, the son entered into a lease with the businessman to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, the son remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre.

In this case, the farmer physically occupied the land for twelve years, did so without interruption, excluded others from possession, and did so without the businessman's permission. Furthermore, his construction of the dam clearly renders his use open and notorious.

She executed two instruments in the proper form of deeds. The first instrument purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre to a husband and wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The second instrument purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre to the husband and wife's only child. The child was thirteen years old at the time. The common-law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. No actual consideration was paid for the deeds. The young woman handed the two deeds to the husband. He promptly and properly recorded the deed to himself and his wife and put the deed to their daughter in a safe-deposit box without recording it. The same year, the husband, wife, and daughter were on a vacation when the plane in which they were flying went down, and all three were killed simultaneously. All three died intestate. The applicable statute in the jurisdiction provides that \"when title to property on its devolution depends on priority of death and there is insufficient evidence that the persons have died otherwise than simultaneous, the property of each person, shall be disposed of as if he had survived.\" An appropriate action was instituted by the heirs of the family. The young woman, who is not an heir of any of the deceased, was a party to the action. The court should determine that title to Greenacre is\nAnswer Choices:\nA. entirely in the young woman.\nB. one-half in the heirs of the husband and one-half in the heirs of the wife.\nC. one-half in the young woman, one-quarter in the heirs of the husband, and one-quarter in the heirs of wife.\nD. one-half in the heirs of the daughter, one-quarter in the heirs of the husband, and one-quarter in the heirs of the wife.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The husband and wife held title to one-half of the property in joint tenancy. A joint tenancy cannot be created without the \"four unities\" (time, title, possession and interest), and can be terminated in one of two ways: by partition or by severance. The daughter held title to the other half of the property in fee simple. If either the husband or wife had survived the accident, the deceased spouse's interest would have gone to the survivor automatically, by virtue of the right of survivorship. Because both spouses died, however, the survivorship right is irrelevant, and their respective interests in one-half of Greenacre (one-fourth each) will go to their heirs. The daughter's interest is unaffected by her parents' interests, as she is not one of their joint tenants. Therefore, the daughter's heirs are entitled to her entire one-half interest in Greenacre, and answer D is correct. Answers A, B and C are all incorrect as they are inconsistent with the ownership interests created by the joint tenancy and the conveyance to the daughter.\n</s>"

His best friend wanted to buy Greenfield and offered $20,000 for it. The man knew that his best friend was insolvent, but replied, \"As a favor to you as an old friend, I will sell Greenfield to you for $20,000 even though it is worth much more, if you can raise the money within one month.\" The best friend wrote the following words, and no more, on a piece of paper: \"I agree to sell Greenfield for $20,000.\" The man then signed the piece of paper and gave it to his friend. Three days later, the man received an offer of $40,000 for Greenfield. He asked his best friend if he had raised the $20,000. When the best friend answered, \"Not yet,\" the man told him that their deal was off and that he was going to accept the $40,000 offer. The next week, the best friend secured a bank commitment to enable him to purchase Greenfield. The best friend immediately brought an appropriate action against the man to compel him to convey Greenfield to the best friend. The following points will be raised during the course of the trial. I. The parol evidence rule. II. Construction of the contract as to time of performance. III. The best friend's ability to perform.

I, II, and III.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The Statute of Frauds requires that a contract for the sale of land consist of a writing signed by the party to be charged. In this case, such a writing exists, having been signed by the man. However, the contract merely states that the man agrees to sell the land for $20,000. It does not indicate whether there are any additional provisions to the agreement (such as the time for performance, which was only verbally addressed by the parties). Further, despite the fact that the man has received a better offer, it appears that his best friend is now ready to perform. As such, it is likely that during the course of a trial: 1) it will be necessary to consider the parol evidence rule with regard to whether the written agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties, 2) the time for performance issue must be addressed, in addition to whether the best friend has a month to raise $20,000, and 3) the best friend's ability to perform must be considered, because he must raise $20,000 to meet his own obligation. Therefore, answer D is correct, as it is the only choice which includes all these issues.\n</s>"

The contract was dated June 19 and called for a closing date on the following August 19. There was no other provision in the contract concerning the closing date. The contract contained the following clause: \"subject to the purchaser obtaining a satisfactory mortgage at the current rate.\" On the date provided for closing, the purchaser advised the seller that he was unable to close because his mortgage application was still being processed by a bank. The seller desired to declare the contract at an end and consulted his attorney in regard to his legal position. Which of the following are relevant in advising the seller of his legal position? I. Is time of the essence? II. Parol evidence rule. III. Statute of Frauds. IV. Specific Performance.\nAnswer Choices:\nA. I and III only.\nB. II and IV only.\nC. II, III, and IV only.\nD. I, II, III, and IV.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n All four concepts are relevant in determining the seller's legal position. Whether \"time is of the essence\" is relevant because where a sale contract indicates that time is of the essence, failure to perform on the scheduled closing date negates the failing party's right to enforce the contract at a later date. The Statute of Frauds is always relevant to land sale contracts, as it requires that all such contracts must be in writing. Specific performance is relevant as it is one of the two remedies (the other being damages) available to the purchaser if the seller attempts to get out of the contract. Finally, it may be relevant for the seller to introduce parol evidence relating to the purchaser\u2019s mortgage application in order to show that the seller\u2019s duty of performance is excused by the failure of a condition precedent (this, however, depends upon whether or not the contract stated that \"time is of the essence\").\n</s>"

All of the lots are in a zone limited to one- and two-family residences under the zoning ordinance. Two years ago, the businessman conveyed Lots 1, 3, and 5. None of the three deeds contained any restrictions. Each of the new owners built a one-family residence. One year ago, the businessman conveyed Lot 2 to a recent college graduate. The deed provided that each of the recent graduate and the businessman, their respective heirs and assigns, would use Lots 2 and 4 respectively only for one-family residential purposes. The deed was promptly and properly recorded. The graduate built a one-family residence on Lot 2. Last month, the businessman conveyed Lot 4 to a law student. The deed contained no restrictions. The deed from the businessman to the recent college graduate was in the title report examined by the law student's lawyer. The law student obtained a building permit and commenced construction of a two-family residence on Lot 4. The recent graduate, joined by the owners of Lots 1, 3, and 5, brought an appropriate action against the law student to enjoin the proposed use of Lot 4, or, alternatively, to recover damages caused by the law student's breach of covenant. Which is the most appropriate comment concerning the outcome of this action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. All plaintiffs should be awarded their requested judgment for injunction because there was a common development scheme, but award of damages should be denied to all.\nB. The recent college graduate should be awarded an appropriate remedy, but recovery by the other plaintiffs is doubtful.\nC. Injunction should be denied, but damages should be awarded to all plaintiffs, measured by diminution of market value, if any, suffered as a result of the proximity of the law student's two-family residence.\nD. All plaintiffs should be denied any recovery or relief because the zoning preempts any private scheme of covenants.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The restriction in the deeds to Lots 2 and 4 constitutes an equitable servitude. An equitable servitude in a deed is only enforceable where a party can establish: 1) intent that the restriction be enforceable by subsequent grantees 2) that the subsequent grantee had notice of the servitude, and 3)that the restriction touches and concerns the land. In this case, the facts indicate that all three elements can be established. The express language of the deeds (\"the recent college graduate and the businessman, and all their respective heirs and assigns\") indicates that the restriction is intended to bind subsequent grantees. The college graduate's recorded deed (that showed up in the title search) provided the law student with record notice of the restriction. And a restriction on what can be built on the land clearly touches and concerns that land, so the equitable servitude is enforceable. The restriction, however, may only be enforced against the law student by the college graduate.\n</s>"

The loan was due at the end of the growing season of the year in which it was made. The owner maintained and operated an orchard on the land, which was his sole source of income. Halfway through the growing season, the owner experienced severe health and personal problems and, as a result, left the state; his whereabouts were unknown. The lender learned that no one was responsible for the cultivation and care of the orchard on Orchardacres. The lender undertook to provide, through employees, the care of the orchard and the harvest for the remainder of the growing season. The net profits were applied to the debt secured by the mortgage on Orchardacres. During the course of the harvest, a business invitee was injured by reason of a fault in the equipment used. Under applicable tort case law, the owner of the premises would be liable for the business invitee's injuries. The business invitee brought an appropriate action against the lender to recover damages for the injuries suffered, relying on this aspect of tort law. In such lawsuit, judgment should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the business invitee, if, but only if, the state is a title theory state, because in other jurisdictions a mortgagee has no title interest but only a lien.\nB. the business invitee, because the lender was a mortgagee in possession.\nC. the lender, because she acted as agent of the owner only to preserve her security interest.\nD. the lender, if, but only if, the mortgage expressly provided for her taking possession in the event of danger to her security interest.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The lender was the mortgagee of Orchardacres. A mortgage conveys an interest in land as security for an obligation that the owner of that land owes to the creditor (the lender). The lender has certain rights prior to an action for default against the owner for non-payment of his mortgage. The lender was aware that the owner had abandoned Orchardacres. As the mortgagee, the lender had the right to enter Orchardacres to correct a situation that would have created waste of the property via the loss of income from the abandoned crops. When she utilized her interest in Orchardacres by entering the property and running it, the lender took possession of the property subject to her interest in it as mortgagee. As such, she was in the position of an owner, not an agent, so the business invitee will prevail in his action.\n</s>"

The owner of Blackacre rented it to a tenant at a monthly rental of $200. The tenant and the owner orally agreed that the tenant would purchase Blackacre from the owner for the sum of $24,000, payable at the rate of $200 a month for ten years and also would pay the real estate taxes and the expenses of insuring and maintaining Blackacre. The owner agreed to give the tenant a deed to Blackacre after five years had passed and $12,000 had been paid on account and to accept from the tenant a note secured by a mortgage for the balance. The tenant continued in possession of Blackacre and performed his obligations as orally agreed. The tenant, without consulting the owner, made improvements for which he paid $1,000. When the tenant had paid $12,000, he tendered a proper note and mortgage to the owner and demanded the delivery of the deed as agreed. The owner did not deny the oral agreement but told the tenant that she had changed her mind, and she refused to complete the transaction. The tenant then brought an action for specific performance. The owner pleaded the Statute of Frauds as her defense. If the owner wins, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. nothing the tenant could have done would have overcome the original absence of a written agreement.\nB. the actions and payments of the tenant are as consistent with his being a tenant as with an oral contract.\nC. the tenant did not secure the owner's approval for the improvements that he made.\nD. the owner has not received any unconscionable benefit, and, therefore, the tenant is not entitled to equitable relief.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The Statute of Frauds mandates that any contract for the sale of land must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. The purpose of the statute is to prevent a party from fraudulently obtaining land by asserting that an oral contract existed where it in fact did not. The writing requirement serves this function by verifying the intent of the parties to enter into a contract for the sale of land. In this case, the tenant's only evidence of an oral contract to sell Blackacre is a history of regular monthly payments and the fact that he made minor improvements to the property. If the owner prevails, it will be because the tenant's actions are just as consistent with him being a tenant as they are with him being party to an oral contract. Therefore, answer B is correct.\n</s>"

In that year he executed and delivered to a purchaser a quitclaim deed which purported to release and quitclaim to the purchaser all of the right, title and interest of the owner in Blackacre. The purchaser accepted the quitclaim and placed the deed in his safety deposit box. The owner was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $35,000. In September, 2001, the owner executed and delivered to the creditor a warranty deed, purporting to convey the fee simple to Blackacre, in exchange for a full release of the debt he owed to the creditor. The creditor immediately recorded his deed. In December, 2001, the purchaser caused his quitclaim deed to Blackacre to be recorded and notified the creditor that he (the purchaser) claimed title. Assume that there is no evidence of occupancy of Blackacre and assume, further, that the jurisdiction where Blackacre is situated has a recording statute which required good faith and value as elements of the junior claimant's priority. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the conflicting claims of the purchaser and the creditor?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The purchaser cannot succeed, because the quitclaim through which he claims prevents him from being bona fide (in good faith).\nB. The outcome will turn on the view taken as to whether the creditor paid value within the meaning of the statute requiring this element.\nC. The outcome will turn on whether the purchaser paid value (a fact not given in the statement).\nD. The purchaser's failure to record until December, 2001, estops him from asserting title against the creditor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The recording statute described in the facts requires good faith and value, but has no timing provisions. Without timing provisions it cannot be a race or race-notice act, so it must be a notice act. To prevail under a notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded their deed without notice of earlier purchasers. To be a BFP, a party must give value for their interest in the land. In this case, the facts indicate that the creditor recorded without notice of the deed to the purchaser. The purchaser, however, would have record notice of the creditor's recording. But the creditor will not be protected by the statute if she is not considered to be a BFP. Therefore, the jurisdiction's view regarding the meaning of \"paid value\" will be determinative in the purchaser's claim, and answer B is correct.\n</s>"

In 1990 the owner platted and obtained all required governmental approvals of two subdivisions of 200 acres each. In 1990 and 1991 commercial buildings and parking facilities were constructed on one, Royal Center, in accordance with the plans disclosed by the plat for each subdivision. Royal Center continues to be used for commercial purposes. The plat of the other, Royal Oaks, showed 250 lots, streets, and utility and drainage easements. All of the lots in Royal Oaks were conveyed during 1990 and 1991. The deeds contained provisions, expressly stated to be binding upon the grantee, his heirs and assigns, requiring the lots to be used only for single-family, residential purposes until 2015. The deeds expressly stated that these provisions were enforceable by the owner of any lot in the Royal Oaks subdivision. At all times since 1979, the 200 acres of Royal Center have been zoned for shopping center use, and the 200 acres in Royal Oaks have been zoned for residential use in a classification which permits both single-family and multiple-family use. Assume that the owner now desires to open his remaining 100 acres as a residential subdivision of 125 lots (with appropriate streets, etc.). He has, as an essential element of his scheme, the feature that the restrictions are identical with those he planned for the original Royal Oaks residential subdivision and, further, that lot owners in Royal Oaks should be able to enforce (by lawsuits) restrictions on the lots in the 100 acres. The zoning for the 100 acres is identical with that for the 200 acres of Royal Oaks residential subdivision. Which of the following best states the chance of success for his scheme?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. He can restrict use only to the extent of that imposed by zoning (that is, to residential use by not more than four dwelling units per lot).\nB. He cannot restrict the 100 acres to residential use because of the conflicting use for retail commercial purposes in the 200 acres comprising the shopping center.\nC. He cannot impose any enforceable restriction to residential use only.\nD. Any chance of success depends upon the 100 acres being considered by the courts as part of a common development scheme which also includes the 200 acres of Royal Oaks.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The restrictions described in the facts constitute equitable servitudes. An equitable servitude in a deed is only enforceable where a party can establish: 1) intent for the restriction to be enforceable by subsequent grantees, 2) that the subsequent grantee had notice of the servitude, and 3) that the restriction touches and concerns the land. In this case, the facts indicate that all three elements can be established. The express language of the deeds indicates that the restriction is intended to bind subsequent grantees. The recording of those deeds would provide later purchasers with record notice of the restriction. And a restriction on what can be built on the land clearly meets the requirement that the restriction touch and concern that land, so an enforceable equitable servitude was created. For an equitable servitude to bind an entire subdivision, however, it must be found in the common building plan for that subdivision. If it is, then anyone who owns a plot of land within the subdivision is bound by the restrictions and may file suit to enforce those restrictions against other owners.\n</s>"

Perez is now occupying Greenacre. The reasonable rental value of the property exceeds the sum necessary to meet all current charges. There is no applicable statute. Under the rules governing contributions between life tenants and remaindermen, how should the burden for payment be allocated?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Rowan must pay the principal payment, but Perez must pay the interest to First Bank.\nB. Rowan must pay both the principal and interest payments to First Bank.\nC. Perez must pay both the principal and interest payments to first Bank.\nD. Perez must pay the principal payment, but Rowan must pay the interest to First Bank.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The facts indicate that Perez has a life estate and Rowan has a vested remainder. Perez, as a life tenant, has a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste relevant to the property during his life tenancy. A failure to keep the property in repair, pay taxes on the property, or pay interest on any mortgage on the property all constitute permissive waste. Although Perez's duty not to commit permissive waste requires him to pay interest on the mortgage, he has no obligation to pay the principal.

The grantee constructed a public health center on the tract within the time specified, and operated it for five years. At the end of this period, the grantee converted the structure into a senior citizens' recreational facility. It is conceded by all parties in interest that a senior citizens' recreational facility is not a public health center. In an appropriate action, the grantor seeks a declaration that the change in the use of the facility has caused the land and structure to revert to her. In this action, the grantor should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. win, because the language of the deed created a determinable fee, which leaves a possibility of reverter in the grantor.\nB. win, because the language of the deed created a fee subject to condition subsequent, which leaves a right of entry or power of termination in the grantor.\nC. lose, because the language of the deed created only a contractual obligation and did not provide for retention of property interest by the grantor.\nD. lose, because an equitable charge is enforceable only in equity.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n It is important to pay close attention to the specific language of any conveyance or restriction you are presented with by the examiners. In this case, the conveyance was made \"subject to the understanding that within one year\" the grantee would build and operate a public health center. Rather than creating an executory interest or reversion, this condition merely represents a contractual obligation. As such, the grantor is merely entitled to contractual damages, not a determination that failing to meet the contractual provision somehow negates the grantee's property rights.

The man executed a mortgage on Brownacre to a lender in order to secure a loan. Subsequently, but before the indebtedness was paid to the lender, the man died intestate with his son as his only heir at law. The jurisdiction in which Brownacre is located recognizes the title theory of mortgages.

A joint tenancy cannot be created without the \"four unities\" (time, title, possession and interest), and can be terminated in one of two ways: by partition or by severance. Where one joint tenant makes an inter vivos conveyance of their interest in the property, a severance occurs and the interest transferred is that of a tenant in common. Similarly, where one joint tenant executes a mortgage, a severance may also occur. Whether a mortgage causes a severance depends upon whether the jurisdiction is a title theory state (severance occurs) or a lien theory state (no severance occurs). Therefore, because the facts indicate that this is a title theory state, as soon as the man executed the mortgage to the lender, the joint tenancy was severed to the extent of the mortgage, and the property was held by the man and the woman as tenants in common, with the man's interest being subject to the mortgage (by executing a mortgage, the man still kept his title). When the man died, his interest in one-half of the property was bequeathed to his son, who takes it subject to the mortgage. As such, answer C is correct. Note that if the man had not executed the mortgage, his entire interest would have gone to the woman upon his death, and his son would have received nothing.\n</s>"

The execution requirement is satisfied as long as the deed is signed by the party to be charged (the seller). Delivery of a deed is established by a proven intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. The grantee's acceptance of the deed will be presumed, unless the grantee explicitly rejects it. In this case, the facts indicate that the son explicitly rejected the deed, so it was never accepted, and answer D is correct.\n</s>"

Each of their lots had an office building. The defendant decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The defendant has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc.). After the defendant had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The defendant used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The plaintiff notified the defendant that cracks were developing in the building situated on the plaintiff's lot. The defendant took the view that any subsidence suffered by the plaintiff was due to the weight of the plaintiff's building, and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the plaintiff's soil been in its natural state. The defendant continued to excavate. The building on the plaintiff's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects.

This can include, among other things, the arguments that the defendant did not properly investigate the probable impact of her excavation; that she failed to shore up the plaintiff's building when the defendant was made aware of the reasonably foreseeable subsidence; and that the defendant did not follow sound engineering practices. Thus D is incorrect. B is therefore the best comment concerning the plaintiff's potential recovery from the defendant.\n</s>"

She built a house in which she took up residence on Lot 1. Thereafter, she built a house on Lot 2, which she sold, house and lot, to a buyer. Consistent with the contract of sale and purchase, the deed conveying Lot 2 from the business woman to the buyer contained the following clause: In the event the buyer, his heirs or assigns, decide to sell the property hereby conveyed and obtain a purchaser ready, willing, and able to purchase Lot 2 and the improvements thereon on terms and conditions acceptable to the buyer, said Lot 2 and improvements shall be offered to the business woman, her heirs or assigns, on the same terms and conditions. The business woman, her heirs or assigns, as the case may be, shall have ten days from said offer to accept said offer and thereby to exercise said option. Three years after delivery and recording of the deed and payment of the purchase price, the buyer became ill and moved to a climate more compatible with his health. The buyer's daughter orally offered to purchase the premises from the buyer at its then fair market value. The buyer declined his daughter's offer but instead deeded Lot 2 to his daughter as a gift. Immediately thereafter, the buyer's daughter sold Lot 2 to a man at the then fair market value of Lot 2. The sale was completed by the delivery of deed and payment of the purchase price. At no time did the buyer or his daughter offer to sell Lot 2 to the business woman. The business woman learned of the conveyance to the buyer's daughter and the sale by the daughter to the man one week after the conveyance of Lot 2 from the daughter to the man. The business woman promptly brought an appropriate action against the man to enforce rights created in him by the deed of the business woman to the buyer. The business woman tendered the amount paid by the man into the court for whatever disposition the court deemed proper. The common-law Rule Against Perpetutities is unmodified by statute. Which of the following will determine whether the business woman will prevail? I. The parol evidence rule. II. The Statute of Frauds. III. The type of recording statute of the jurisdiction in question. IV. The Rule Against Perpetuities\nAnswer Choices:\nA. I only.\nB. IV only.\nC. I and IV only.\nD. II and III only.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The key to this question is identifying the appropriate dispute issue. The business woman placed a right of first refusal into the deed she sold to the buyer. There is no dispute regarding an agreement outside the writing, so the parol evidence rule (I) will not apply. The buyer's oral discussion with his daughter regarding purchase of Lot 2 is irrelevant because he refused to sell and instead deeded the lot to her as a gift; there is no Statute of Frauds (II) issue regarding the sale of land (thus triggering the right of first refusal) because no oral sales agreement was reached. Finally, the man does not have the protection of a bona fide purchaser because he had constructive notice of the deed's restrictions, which were properly recorded and cannot be circumvented through the alienation of land by gift; only a purchaser for value can provide the shelter of superior title. The jurisdiction's type of recording statute (III) is thus irrelevant to the resolution of this dispute. The right of first refusal was clearly violated by the buyer and his daughter. The issue the business woman must overcome in order to prevail is a determination of whether the vague conditional wording of the right of first refusal violated the rule against perpetuities (IV). While the RAP generally does not apply to interests retained by the grantor, it does apply to options and rights of first refusal if they are mere contract or covenant rights. Thus, B is the correct response. A, C and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

The written contract required the owner to provide evidence of marketable title of record, specified a closing date, stated that \"time is of the essence,\" and provided that at closing, the owner would convey by warranty deed. The cousin paid the owner $2,000 earnest money toward the $40,000 purchase price. The title evidence showed that an undivided one-eighth interest in Blackacre was owned by a woman. The cousin immediately objected to title and said he would not close on the owner's title. The owner responded, accurately, that the woman was his daughter who would be trekking in Nepal until two weeks after the specified closing date. He said that she would gladly deed her interest upon her return, and that meanwhile his deed warranting title to all of Blackacre would fully protect the cousin. The owner duly tendered his deed but the cousin refused to close. The cousin brought an appropriate action to recover the $2,000 earnest money promptly after the specified closing date. The owner counterclaimed for specific performance, tendering a deed from himself and the woman, who had by then returned. The court will hold for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the owner, because the woman's deed completing the transfer was given within a reasonable time.\nB. the owner, because his warranty deed would have given his cousin adequate interim protection.\nC. the cousin, because the owner's title was not marketable and time was of the essence.\nD. the cousin, because under the circumstances the earnest money amount was excessive.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n In general, a seller is required to provide marketable title on the closing date. Where the sale contract does not indicate that \"time is of the essence,\" however, the seller's performance need only occur within a reasonable time after the scheduled closing date. As such, a buyer under that contract will not be able to rescind or seek damages until that reasonable time (sometimes as much as several months) has passed without the seller providing marketable title. In contrast, where the contract does indicate that time is of the essence, whichever party fails to perform by the scheduled closing date loses their right to enforce the contract. In this case, the contract indicated that time is of the essence, and the owner failed to perform by the scheduled closing date, so answer C is correct and the cousin will prevail. Answers A and B are incorrect as a result of the time is of the essence clause. Answer D is incorrect because the amount of earnest money paid is irrelevant here.\n</s>"

Although it was not discernible from the outside, Whiteacre had been converted by the banker from a single-family house to a structure that contained three separate apartments, in violation of the zoning ordinance. Further, the conversion was in violation of the building code. The banker and an employee entered into a valid written contract for the purchase and sale of Whiteacre. The contract provided that the banker was to convey to the employee a marketable title. The contract was silent as to zoning. The employee had fully inspected Whiteacre. Prior to the closing, the employee learned that Whiteacre did not conform to the zoning ordinance and refused to close even though the banker was ready, willing, and able to perform his contract obligations. The banker brought an appropriate action for specific performance against the employee . In that action, the banker should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. win, because the banker was able to convey a marketable title.\nB. win, because the employee was charged with knowledge of the zoning ordinance prior to entering the contract.\nC. lose, because the illegal conversion of Whiteacre creates the risk of litigation.\nD. lose, because the illegal conversion of Whiteacre was done by the banker rather than by a predecessor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n In general, a seller is required to provide marketable title on the closing date. To be considered marketable, the title must be free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictive covenants and easements. In establishing whether an encumbrance exists with regard to local codes and ordinances, it is important to distinguish between building codes and zoning laws. A property's being in violation of the building code is not considered an encumbrance, and title to that building is marketable. In contrast, where a property is in violation of zoning laws, the violation is considered an encumbrance, and the title is unmarketable. Because the banker's conversion violates the zoning laws and puts a buyer at risk of being sued for the violations, the employee will prevail, and answer C is correct. Answers B and D are incorrect because the non-compliance with the zoning laws, not knowledge of the violation or responsibility for performing the illegal work, is determinative in rendering title unmarketable. Answer A is incorrect because the banker was not able to convey marketable title.\n</s>"

The buyer paid the owner a $5,000 deposit to be applied to the purchase price. The contract stated that the owner had the right at his option to retain the deposit as liquidated damages in the event of the buyer's default. The closing was to have taken place last week. Six weeks ago, the buyer was notified by his employer that he was to be transferred to another job 1,000 miles away. The buyer immediately notified the owner that he could not close, and therefore he demanded the return of his $5,000. The owner refused, waited until after the contract closing date, listed with a broker, and then conveyed Liveacre for $108,000 to a subsequent purchaser found by the real estate broker. The subsequent purchaser paid the full purchase price and immediately recorded his deed. The subsequent purchaser knew of the prior contract with the original buyer. In an appropriate action, the original buyer seeks to recover the $5,000 deposit from the owner. The most probable result will be that the owner\nAnswer Choices:\nA. must return the $5,000 to the original buyer, because the owner can no longer carry out his contract with the original buyer.\nB. must return the $5,000 to the original buyer, because he was legally justified in not completing the contract.\nC. must return $3,000 to the original buyer, because the owner's damages were only $2,000.\nD. may keep the $5,000 deposit, because the original buyer breached the contract.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n A party to a land sale contract may seek either damages or specific performance in the event of a breach by the other party. In this case, the original buyer has breached the sale contract, and the owner kept the original buyer's $5,000 deposit as damages. Although many students will incorrectly choose answer C because the owner only lost $2,000 on the eventual sale,  Answer D is correct. A seller is entitled to keep a buyer's deposit as liquidated damages following the buyer's breach of contract, as long as that deposit was 10% of the sale price or less. The facts indicate that original buyer's deposit was $5,000, or 4.5% of the sale price, so the owner is entitled to keep it as liquidated damages. Therefore, choice D is correct, and choices A, B, and C are incorrect.\n</s>"

She signed a promissory note secured by a duly executed and recorded mortgage. There was no \"due on sale\" clause, that is, no provision that, upon sale, the whole balance then owing would become due and owing. The woman conveyed Woodsedge to a friend \"subject to a mortgage to the bank, which the grantee assumes and agrees to pay.\" The friend conveyed Woodsedge to his son \"subject to an existing mortgage to the bank.\" A copy of the note and the mortgage that secured it had been exhibited to each grantee. After the son made three timely payments, no further payments were made by any party. In fact, the real estate had depreciated to a point where it was worth less than the debt. There is no applicable statute or regulation. In an appropriate foreclosure action, the bank joined the woman, her friend, and the son as defendants. At the foreclosure sale, although the fair market value for Woodsedge in its depreciated state was obtained, a deficiency resulted. The bank is entitled to collect a deficiency judgment against\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the woman only.\nB. the woman and the friend only.\nC. the friend and his son only.\nD. the woman, the friend, and the son.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The mortgagor of a property is free to transfer title to that property BUT: 1) the mortgagor remains personally liable on the mortgage, and 2) all subsequent grantees take the property subject to the mortgage. Further, subsequent grantees do not become personally liable on the mortgage unless they explicitly assume the mortgage. Therefore, the mortgagor will always be personally liable on the mortgage, all subsequent grantees who assume the mortgage will be personally liable on it, and all subsequent grantees (whether they assume the mortgage or not) can lose the property through foreclosure if the mortgage is not paid. In this case, the woman is the mortgagor and remains personally liable on it regardless of her transfers. The friend explicitly assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage in his transaction with the woman, so the friend is also personally liable. The son, however, took the property subject to the mortgage but did not assume it, therefore he is not personally liable on it, and is only at risk to the extent that he will lose the property if the mortgage is foreclosed upon.

The testator's charitable gift of the land to the church was a valid conveyance that was made without any conditions. Therefore, the church was free to convey the land to the developer. Further, the conveyance made the land the church's property rather than the testator's, so it was not a part of the estate that was bequeathed to the friend upon his death.

During the last 15 years of her lifetime, the aunt allowed the brother to occupy an apartment in the house on Blackacre, to rent the other apartment in the house to various tenants, and to retain the rent. The brother made no payments to the aunt; and since the aunt's death 7 years ago, he has made no payments to his sister. For those 22 years, the brother has paid the real estate taxes on Blackacre, kept the building on Blackacre insured, and maintained the building. At all times, the sister has lived in a distant city and has never had anything to do with the aunt, her brother, or Blackacre. Recently, the sister needed money to run her business and demanded that her brother join her in selling Blackacre. He refused.

The brother and sister joined in mortgaging Greenacre to a private lender by a properly recorded mortgage that contained a general warranty clause. The brother became disenchanted with land-owning and notified his sister that he would no longer contribute to the payment of installments due to the private lender. After the mortgage was in default and the private lender made demand for payment of the entire amount of principal and interest due, the sister tendered to the private lender, and the private lender deposited, a check for one-half of the amount due the private lender. The sister then demanded a release of her undivided one-half interest. The private lender refused to release any interest in Greenacre. The sister promptly brought an action against the private lender to quiet title to an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre. In such action, the sister should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. lose, because the private lender's title had been warranted by an express provision of the mortgage.\nB. lose, because there was no redemption from the mortgage.\nC. win, because the sister is entitled to marshalling.\nD. win, because the cotenancy of the mortgagors was in common and not joint.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Although the brother and sister each independently own an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre, they chose to mortgage the property jointly. Therefore, the private lender holds a mortgage to all of Greenacre, for which the brother and the sister are jointly and severally liable. The joint mortgage represents a contractual agreement between the brother and the sister as a single entity on the one hand, and the private lender on the other. The sister's making a payment of half of what is owed on the mortgage has the same legal effect as paying off half of any debt - the rest of the debt is still owed. To protect her one-half interest, the sister should have obtained a mortgage on only her own interest. That would have left her rights unaffected by any actions or inactions of the brother. Because the mortgage was entered jointly, the private lender is not required to release any of the interest she holds in Greenacre. Therefore, answer B is correct, and A, C, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

The owner later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a private lender, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the owner defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose on the mortgage on the owner's hotel at that time, but instead brought an action, appropriate under the laws of the jurisdiction and authorized by the mortgage loan documents, for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. The bank later brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The private lender was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted as follows: The bank purchased the hotel for $100,000 less than its mortgage balance. The bank purchased the parking garage for an amount that is $200,000 in excess of the private lender's mortgage balance. The $200,000 surplus arising from the bid paid by the bank for the parking garage should be paid\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $100,000 to the bank and $100,000 to the owner.\nB. $100,000 to the private lender and $100,000 to the owner.\nC. $100,000 to the bank and $100,000 to the private lender.\nD. $200,000 to the owner.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n This question is most easily answered by diagramming the amounts each party owes or is owed. After the judicial foreclosure sale of the hotel, the bank was still owed $100,000. After the foreclosure sale of the garage, the private lender was owed nothing, and had a surplus of $200,000. After both foreclosures were completed, the owner owed $100,000 to the bank, and owed nothing to the private lender. Because the private lender is owed nothing, it is not entitled to any of the surplus, and answers B and C can be eliminated. Answer D is incorrect because the bank, as a mortgagee, stands ahead of the owner in the line of priority and must receive all the money it is owed before the owner will be entitled to receive anything. Once the bank has been paid the remaining $100,000 it is owed, any surplus (which in this case is $100,000) will go to the owner. Therefore, answer A is correct, and answers B, C, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

One year ago, the church dissolved and its church building situated on the land was demolished. There is no applicable statute. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. In an appropriate action, the landowner's heir and the attorney general, who is the appropriate official to assert public interests in charitable trusts, contest the right to the land. In such action, who will prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landowner's heir, as successor to the landowner's possibility of reverter.\nB. The landowner's heir, because a charity cannot convey assets donated to it.\nC. The attorney general, because cy pres should be applied to devote the land to religious purposes to carry out the charitable intent of the landowner.\nD. The attorney general, because the landowner's attempt to restrict the church's fee simple violated the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The conveyance to the church created a fee simple determinable. The future interest retained by the grantor is a possibility of reverter. The church's right to possession ended automatically when the church stopped using the land as the site for its principal religious edifice. The heir inherited the possibility of reverter retained by the landowner and is entitled to possession. The Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply to a grantor's interests, such as a possibility of reverter.\n</s>"

The contract stipulated that the seller would deliver to the buyer, upon the payment of the last installment due, \"a warranty deed sufficient to convey a fee simple title.\" The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The buyer entered into possession of the land. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the buyer discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on the land, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25 percent of the purchase price that the buyer had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the seller had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the seller. The value of the land was then four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. The buyer quit possession of the land, stopped making payments on the contract, and demanded that the seller repay the amounts that the buyer had paid under the contract. After the seller refused the demand, the buyer sued the seller to recover damages for the seller's alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the buyer?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nB. Yes, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a mortgage and the outstanding mortgage impairs the buyer's equity of redemption.\nC. No, because an installment purchase contract is treated as a security device.\nD. No, because the time for the seller to deliver marketable title has not arrived.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Title does not have to be marketable until the closing date when all payments have been received. The buyer still has 290 payments to make. A mortgage can render title unmarketable but it is most likely that title will be marketable when all payments have been made by the buyer under the agreement. The seller has made all mortgage payments timely. The amount of the mortgage debt is 25 percent of the purchase price the buyer will pay, and the land is four times more valuable than the debt owed, so it is likely that the mortgage debt will be paid off by the time the seller must provide the warranty deed, and thus the buyer is not entitled to damages at this time. Thus, Answer D is correct.\n</s>"

Fifteen years ago, after a part of the path located on his land and connecting his cabin to the public highway washed out, the man cleared a small part of his neighbor's land and rerouted a section of the path through the neighbor's land. Twelve years ago, the neighbor leased her land to some hunters. For the next 12 years, the hunters and the man who had rerouted the path used the path for access to the highway. A month ago, the neighbor discovered that part of the path was on her land. The neighbor told the man that she had not given him permission to cross her land and that she would be closing the rerouted path after 90 days. The man's land and the neighbor's land have never been in common ownership. The period of time necessary to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The period of time necessary to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. What should the lawyer tell the man concerning his right to use the rerouted path on the neighbor's land?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The man has fee title by adverse possession of the land included in the path.\nB. The man has an easement by necessity to use the path.\nC. The man has an easement by prescription to use the path.\nD. The man has no right to use the path.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The man is claiming a right to use the land of the neighbor, which is an easement. An easement by prescription requires that the use be without the neighbor's permission for the requisite period of time. The man has used the path for the past 15 years without the neighbor's permission. His use was open and notorious in that the neighbor could have seen him. His use was continuous and without interruption by the neighbor. His use was actual. An easement acquired by prescription need not be exclusive. With an easement, the owner may make any use of the easement area that does not interfere with the use made by the easement holder unless the easement is expressly noted as exclusive. The use by the neighbor's tenants (the hunters) did not interfere with the man's use, nor did his use interfere with theirs. Thus, Answer C is correct and Answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

Until a year ago, the man lived in the house alone. The sister and the cousin are longtime residents of another state. One year ago, the man moved to an apartment and rented the house to a tenant for three years under a lease that the man and the tenant both signed. The tenant has since paid the rent each month to the man. Recently, the sister and the cousin learned about the rental. They brought an appropriate action against the tenant to have the lease declared void and to have the tenant evicted. The tenant raised all available defenses. What will the court likely decide?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The lease is void, and the tenant is evicted.\nB. The lease is valid, and the tenant retains exclusive occupancy rights for the balance of the term.\nC. The lease is valid, but the tenant is evicted because one-third of the lease term has expired and the man had only a one-third interest to transfer.\nD.

The man, as a tenant in common, validly transferred his interest in the tenancy in common to the tenant by a lease for a term of years. The tenant must, however, share the right of possession with the other cotenants, the sister and the cousin, for the term of the lease. The man must share the rental income with the sister and the cousin. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answer A is incorrect.\n</s>"

A neighbor who owned the property immediately adjacent to the land wrongfully began to possess the land at that time. For 24 of the next 25 years, the neighbor planted and harvested crops on the land, hunted on it, and parked cars on it. However, in the sixth year after he first took possession of the land, the neighbor neither planted crops nor hunted nor parked cars on the land because he spent that entire year living in Europe. The neighbor built a small gardening shed on the land, but he never built a residence on it. When the daughter was 28, she was declared mentally incompetent and had a conservator appointed to oversee her affairs. Since then, she has continuously resided in a care facility. The applicable statute of limitations provides as follows: \"An ejectment action shall be brought within 21 years after the cause of action accrues, but if the person entitled to bring the cause of action is under age 18 or mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues, it may be brought by such person within 10 years after attaining age 18 or after the person becomes competent.\" If the daughter's conservator wins an ejectment action against the neighbor, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter was age 17 when the neighbor first took possession of the land.\nB. Because the daughter is mentally incompetent, the statute of limitations has been tolled.\nC. The neighbor never built a residence on the land.\nD. The neighbor was not in continuous possession of the land for 21 years.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n An adverse claimant may obtain title to land by adverse possession when the claimant's possession of the land is (i) open and notorious, (ii) actual and exclusive, (iii) hostile (without the owner's permission), and (iv) continuous for the applicable statutory period. Here, the time period necessary to acquire title by adverse possession in this jurisdiction is a minimum of 21 years. The neighbor has not been in continuous adverse possession for an entire 21-year period because the neighbor spent one year in Europe after the first five years of possession. Thus, Answer D is correct. Because the daughter was a minor when the adverse possession began, she would be entitled to the protection of the tolling statute if it would extend the time in which she could bring her ejectment action. The tolling statute would not assist her in this case, however, because her minority ended within one year, when she turned 18, and the extension period of 10 years would allow her only 11 years in which to bring her action, less than the minimum time period of 21 years provided in the first part of the statute. The daughter's subsequent mental disability has no effect on the running of the statute. Thus, Answer A is incorrect.\n</s>"

The man who owns Meadowview prepared a development plan creating 200 house lots in Meadowview with the necessary streets and public areas. The plan was fully approved by all necessary governmental agencies and duly recorded. However, construction of the streets, utilities, and other aspects of the development of Meadowview has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the municipality in which Meadowview is located. College Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent one-acre parcel owned by a woman. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. The woman sold Whiteacre to a friend. The description used in the deed from the woman to the friend was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, \"thence by land of Black, north-easterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less,\" was changed to \"thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview North 46-East 201.6 feet,\" with full reference to the plan and its recording data. The friend now seeks a building permit which will show that the friend intends to use College Avenue for access to Whiteacre. The man objects to the granting of a building permit on the grounds that he has never granted any right to the woman or her friend to use College Avenue. There are no governing statutes or ordinances relating to the problem. The man brings an appropriate action in which the right of the friend to use College Avenue without an express grant from the man is at issue. The best argument for the friend in this action is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. there is a way by necessity over Meadowview's lands to gain access to a public road.\nB. the deed from the woman to her friend referred to the recorded plan and therefore created rights to use the streets delineated on the plan.\nC. sale of lots in Meadowview by reference to its plan creates private easements in the streets shown in the plan.\nD. the recording of the plan is a dedication of the streets shown on the plan to public use.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The friend\u2019s best argument is that the streets on the plan signify a public dedication. Where there is: 1) an expressed intent to dedicate land for public use, and 2) an acceptance of the dedication, a public dedication of land is established, and title to the land will pass to the public entity. In this case, the plan was recorded containing language that clearly indicates that streets and other \"public areas\" have been set aside for public use. Further, the plan was fully approved by all necessary government (public) agencies, which arguably establishes that they have accepted the dedication of those streets and areas to the public. Therefore, the friend\u2019s best argument is that the plan constitutes a public dedication of the street areas, and answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The deed contained descriptions as follows: (I) All of my land and dwelling known as 44 Main Street, Midtown, United States, being one acre. (II) All that part of my farm, being a square with 200-foot sides, the southeast corner of which is in the north line of my neighbor. The deed contained covenants of general warranty, quiet enjoyment, and right to convey. The father handed the deed to his daughter who immediately returned it to her father for safekeeping. Her father kept it in his safe deposit box. The deed was not recorded. The property at 44 Main Street covered 7/8 of an acre of land, had a dwelling and a garage situated thereon, and was subject to a right of way, described in prior deeds, in favor of a different neighbor. The father owned no other land on Main Street. This neighbor had not used the right of way for ten years and it was not visible on inspection of the property. The description of part of the father's farm\nAnswer Choices:\nA. is sufficient if consideration has been paid.\nB. is sufficient because no ambiguity therein appears on the face of the deed.\nC. could be enforced if the deed contained a covenant of seisin.\nD. is insufficient because of vagueness.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The description of land found in a deed only needs to be specific enough to allow a party to identify and locate the property. The description does not need to be made in \"metes and bounds,\" but if it is, that metes and bounds description will be given effect, even if contradicted by other descriptive language or characterizations in the deed. Further, while the description need not be exact (and may even contain minor discrepancies), if it is not sufficient to allow location the property, it will be considered insufficient and any attempted transfer of rights using that deed will be void for vagueness. In this case, the description in the deed relating to the farm is too vague to allow anyone to locate the property. Because the description is insufficient to allow location of the property, it is too vague and answer D is correct. Answers A and C are incorrect because consideration and covenants are irrelevant to evaluations of language in a deed. Answer B is incorrect because a deed can be unambiguous and still be too vague.\n</s>"

Two years later, the utility company advised the owner of its intention to install an additional six-inch pipeline parallel to and three feet laterally from the original pipeline. In an appropriate action, the owner sought a declaration that the utility company has no right to install the second pipeline. If the owner prevails, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. any right implied to expand the original use of the right-of-way creates an interest that violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\nB. the original installation by the utility company defined the scope of the easement.\nC. the owner did not expressly agree to the location of the right-of-way.\nD. the assertion of the right to install an additional pipeline constitutes inverse condemnation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The easement described in the facts is an express easement in gross. Unlike an easement appurtenant, which involves two plots of land, an easement in gross only involves one. The holder of an easement is entitled to reasonable use of that easement, in accordance with whatever scope of use the express grant defined. Where the easement holder makes use of an easement that is excessive and beyond its scope, the landowner may sue for an injunction preventing such use but is not entitled to terminate the original grant. In this case, the facts indicate that the owner created an express easement in gross, allowing the utility company to run a gas pipeline. The utility company's subsequent attempt to install another pipeline in a different location is beyond the scope of the easement that was granted. The owner has rightfully sued to prevent that excessive use, so answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The brother collected all rents and paid all expenses, including real estate taxes. The nephew did not object, and this state of affairs continued for five years until 1987. In that year, the brother executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Profitacre to his girlfriend. The nephew, no admirer of the girlfriend, asserted his right to ownership of Profitacre. The girlfriend asserted her ownership and said that if the nephew had any rights he was obligated to pay real estate taxes, even though the brother had been kind enough to pay them in the past.

The girlfriend owns an estate for her life, is entitled to all income, and must pay real estate taxes; the nephew owns the remainder interest.\nC. The girlfriend owns an estate for the life of the brother, is entitled to all income, and must pay real estate taxes; the nephew owns the remainder interest.\nD. The girlfriend owns an estate for the life of the brother and is entitled to all income; the nephew owns the remainder interest, and must pay real estate taxes.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The following estates are identified by the facts: the brother held a life estate; he conveyed it to the girlfriend, who owns a life estate for the rest of the brother's life; the nephew holds a vested remainder, which is unaffected by the conveyance from the brother to the girlfriend.TAXES - The girlfriend incorrectly argues that the nephew is required to pay real estate taxes on the property. As a life tenant, the girlfriend has a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste relevant to the property during her life tenancy. A failure to keep the property in repair, to pay real estate taxes, or to pay interest on any mortgage on the property will all constitute permissive waste. Therefore, it is the girlfriend's responsibility, not the nephew's, to pay the taxes, and answer D is incorrect. OWNERSHIP - the nephew incorrectly argues that the brother's life estate was forfeited by his conveyance to the girlfriend. As a life tenant, the brother has the right to keep the property for life, as well as the right to convey it to any person that he wishes to. Any conveyance he makes, however, is only good for as long as the measuring life, the brother, is alive. As such, the brother's conveyance to the girlfriend was allowed and answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because the girlfriend owns an estate for the length of the brother's life, not the length of her own life.\n</s>"

Her daughter lived with her and always referred to Blackacre as \"my property.\" Two years ago, the daughter, for a valuable consideration, executed and delivered to her boyfriend an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey Blackacre to the boyfriend in fee simple, reserving to herself an estate for two years in Blackacre. The boyfriend promptly and properly recorded the deed. One year ago, the woman died and by will, duly admitted to probate, left her entire estate to the daughter. One month ago, the daughter, for a valuable consideration, executed and delivered to a buyer an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey Blackacre to the buyer, who promptly and properly recorded the deed. The daughter was then in possession of Blackacre and the buyer had no actual knowledge of the deed to the boyfriend. Immediately thereafter, the daughter gave possession to the buyer. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" Last week, the daughter fled the jurisdiction.

If the buyer wins, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the daughter had nothing to convey to the boyfriend two years ago.\nB. the daughter's deed to the boyfriend was not to take effect until after the daughter's deed to the buyer.\nC. the buyer was first in possession.\nD. the daughter's deed to the boyfriend was not in the buyer's chain of title.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The recording statute identified in the facts is a notice act. To prevail under a notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded their deed without notice of earlier purchasers. To be a BFP, a party must give value for their interest in the land. In this case, the buyer is a BFP who recorded without notice of any earlier purchasers. He did not have record notice, because a record search of the chain of title for the deed he received would not have included the boyfriend's deed. Further, he did not have constructive notice, because the daughter's occupancy of the land would lead him to believe that she was the rightful owner as she purported to be. If a judgment is entered in favor of the buyer, it will be because he recorded without notice of earlier purchasers and is protected by the recording act. Therefore, answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The landlord entered into a written three-year lease of Blackacre with a tenant. Among other provisions, the lease prohibited the tenant from \"assigning this lease, in whole or in part, and from subletting Blackacre, in whole or in part.\" In addition to a house, a barn, and a one-car garage, Blackacre's 30 acres included several fields where first the landlord, and now the tenant, grazed sheep. During the following months, the tenant; I. By a written agreement allowed one neighbor exclusive use of the garage for storage, under lock and key, of his antique automobile for two years, charging him $240. II. Told a different neighbor that the neighbor could use the fields to practice her golf as long as she did not disturb the tenant's sheep. Which, if any, of the tenant's actions constituted a violation of the lease?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. I only.\nB. II only.\nC. Both I and II.\nD. Neither I nor II.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n This question requires you to determine whether various actions by a tenant amounted to: 1) an assignment, 2) a sublease, or 3) neither of these. An assignment of a lease by a tenant occurs where the tenant transfers all its rights and duties under a lease to another party (an \"assignee\") for the entire length of time remaining on the lease. By contrast, a sublease is a transfer by a tenant to another party (a \"sublessee\") for a time period shorter than the time remaining on the lease. The facts indicate that the tenant allowed one of her neighbors to practice her golf game on part of the land. The tenant has not given up any of her rights to the land or relieved any of her duties related to it through this action; the golf playing neighbor is simply an invited guest. Since the tenant's lease does not prohibit her from having guests on the land, answers B and C may be eliminated.\n</s>"

Shortly after the landowner's death, his daughter executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey the land to her friend. A year later, the daughter died intestate, with her mother, the original landowner's wife, as her sole heir. The following month, the wife re-married. She then executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey the land to her new husband as a wedding gift. Who now owns what interest in the land?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The daughter's friend owns the fee simple.\nB. The wife owns the fee simple.\nC. The wife's new husband has a life estate in the land for the wife's life, with the remainder in the daughter's friend.\nD.

The daughter had a vested remainder and an executory interest. Both of the daughter's interests could be assigned to the friend. On the remarriage of the landowner's wife, the wife's life estate ended and it automatically went to the holder of the future interest, who was then the daughter's friend. The landowner's wife had no interest in the land to give to her new husband at the time she executed the deed. Answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

For the past nine years, the rancher has impounded on her land the water that resulted from rain and melting snow, much of which flowed from the farmer's land. The rancher uses the water in her livestock operation. Recently, the farmer increased the size of his farming operation and built a dam on his land near the boundary between the two tracts. Because of the dam, these waters no longer drain from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. There is no applicable statute. The rancher sued the farmer to restrain him from interfering with the natural flow of the water onto her land. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The farmer, because he has the right to use all of the water impounded on his land.\nB. The farmer, because the rancher's past impoundment of water estops her from asserting the illegality of the farmer's dam.\nC.

The man's estate consisted of a residence as well as significant personal property. By his duly probated will, the man devised the residence to a friend who was specifically identified in the will. The residue of the estate was given to a stated charity. The man's friend, although alive at the time the man executed the will, predeceased the man. The friend's wife and their child, who has a disability, survived the man. The value of the residence has increased significantly because of recent zoning changes. There is credible extrinsic evidence that the man wanted his friend to own the residence after the man's death so that the friend and his wife could care for their child there. There is no applicable statute. If both the charity and the child claim the residence, to whom should the estate distribute the residence?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The charity, because the devise to the friend adeemed.\nB. The charity, because the devise to the friend lapsed.\nC. The child, because extrinsic evidence exists that the man's intent was to benefit the child.\nD.

If a named beneficiary predeceases the testator, the gift to that beneficiary lapses. In this case, the gift to the friend lapsed because the friend predeceased the man. The gift of the residence was a specific gift, and the lapse of this specific gift passes the residence through the residuary clause of the will. The charity is the residuary taker. There is no applicable anti-lapse statute which might have substituted the friend's child as the beneficiary of the bequest if the friend were a protected beneficiary under the statute. Thus, Answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The plan showed 90 one-acre lots and a ten-acre tract in the center that was designated \"Future Public School.\" The owner published and distributed a brochure promoting Happy Acres which emphasized the proximity of the lots to the school property and indicated potential tax savings \"because the school district will not have to expend tax money to acquire this property.\" There is no specific statute concerning the dedication of school sites. The owner sold 50 of the lots to individual purchasers. Each deed referred to the recorded plan and also contained the following clause: \"No mobile home shall be erected on any lot within Happy Acres.\" A woman was one of the original purchasers from the owner. In 2006, the owner sold the remaining 40 lots and the ten-acre tract to a man by a deed which referred to the plan and contained the restriction relating to mobile homes. The man sold the 40 lots to individual purchasers and the ten-acre tract to a friend. None of the deeds from the man referred to the plan or contained any reference to mobile homes. One of the individual purchasers, who purchased his lot from the man, has placed a mobile home on it, and the woman brings an action against this purchaser to force him to remove it.

The facts indicate that all four elements are present, so answer A is correct. Many students will incorrectly choose answer C as it appears to indicate that the purchaser did not have notice of the restrictive covenant. The facts, however, indicate that the subdivision plan was duly recorded, and that recording suffices to put the purchaser on notice.

She paid rent of $125 in advance each month. During the second month of occupancy, the tenant organized the other tenants in the building as a tenants' association, and the association made demands of the landlord concerning certain repairs and improvements the tenants wanted. When the tenant tendered rent for the third month, the landlord notified her that rent for the fourth and subsequent months would be $200 per month. The tenant protested and pointed out that all other tenants paid rent of $125 per month. Thereupon, the landlord gave the required statutory notice that the tenancy was being terminated at the end of the third month. By an appropriate proceeding, the tenant contests the landlord's right to terminate. If the tenant succeeds, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. a periodic tenancy was created by implication.\nB. the doctrine prohibiting retaliatory eviction is part of the law of the jurisdiction.\nC. the $200 rent demanded violates the agreement implied by the rate charged to other tenants.\nD. the law implies a term of one year in the absence of any express agreement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A leasehold agreement between a landlord and tenant creates a contractual obligation for both parties in relation to a specified piece of property. Specifically, a landlord is required to allow the tenant to possess the land once the lease commences, and the tenant is required to pay rent and refrain from committing waste. In this case, the tenant contends that the landlord has violated her rights under the lease by raising her rent above that of other tenants and by attempting to retake possession of the land. While the tenant is incorrect in arguing that all tenants must be charged the same rent, she may be able to prevent the landlord from retaking possession. The facts indicate that the landlord did not raise the rent or seek to end the tenancy until after the tenant organized a tenants association. As such, if the tenant prevails, it will be because the landlord is not allowed to evict her in retaliation for exercising her legal right to associate. Therefore, answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The deed was never recorded. About a year after the delivery of the deed, the grantor decided that this gift had been ill-advised. She requested that her daughter destroy the deed, which the daughter dutifully and voluntarily did. Within the month following the destruction of the deed, the grantor and the daughter were killed in a common disaster. Each of the successors in interest claimed title to Brownacre. In an appropriate action to determine the title to Brownacre, the probable outcome will be that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The grantor was the owner of Brownacre, because the daughter was a donee and therefore could not acquire title by quitclaim deed.\nB. The grantor was the owner of Brownacre, because title to Brownacre reverted to her upon the voluntary destruction of the deed by the daughter.\nC. The daughter was the owner of Brownacre, because her destruction of the deed to Brownacre was under the undue influence of the grantor.\nD. The daughter was the owner of Brownacre, because the deed was merely evidence of her title, and its destruction was insufficient to cause title to pass back to the grantor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The only requirements for transferring legal title in land are execution and delivery of the deed. Execution occurs when the seller (the party to be charged) signs the deed. Delivery is effected by proving intent to pass title, even if the transferor never physically gives the title document to the transferee. It is the intent to pass title, not physical possession of the deed, that determines validity of a conveyance. Once title has been conveyed, the grantee can return it by executing and delivering a new deed back to the grantor, not by merely destroying the original deed. Here, the grantor intended to pass title to the daughter, physically delivered a deed to the daughter, and the daughter accepted it. The grantor's execution and delivery of the deed plus the daughter's acceptance of it transferred title to the daughter. Subsequent destruction of the physical deed is irrelevant to the daughter's ownership.\n</s>"

A posthumous child was born to the testator.\nB. The testator's will expressed the intention to include all afterborn grandchildren in the gift.\nC.

Answering RAP questions is best accomplished in two parts: 1) identify the type of interests created by the language of the deed, and 2) if the interest is one of the three that the RAP applies to, determine whether it would be possible for that interest to vest any later than twenty-one years after everyone alive at the time of the conveyance has died. If it could, the interest is void.\n</s>"

The will had no residuary clause. The owner was survived by his brother and by his daughter, who was the owner's sole heir. The common law rule against perpetuities applies in the state where the land is located, and the state also has a statute providing that, \"All future estates and interests are alienable, descendible, and devisable in the same manner as possessory estates and interests.\" In 1985 the neighbor and girlfriend entered into a contract with a buyer whereby the neighbor and girlfriend contracted to sell Blackacre to the buyer in fee simple. After examining title, the buyer refused to perform on the ground that the neighbor and girlfriend could not give good title. The neighbor and girlfriend joined in an action against the buyer for specific performance. Prayer for specific performance will be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. granted, because the neighbor and daughter together own a fee simple absolute in Blackacre.\nB. granted, because the neighbor alone owns the entire fee simple in Blackacre.\nC. denied, because the brother has a valid interest in Blackacre.\nD. denied, because the American Red Cross has a valid interest in Blackacre.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n This question illustrates the advantage of reading the call of the question before the fact pattern. The issue only concerns Blackacre; Whiteacre is a red-herring that is meant to confuse and distract. The executory interest in Blackacre's deed violates the rule against perpetuities (RAP) because its conditions will not vest within 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. There is no measuring life in Blackacre's condition and no means to ensure the conditions will vest or fail in a specific time frame. Consequently, the second clause granting the land to the Red Cross will be stricken, so answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

The landlord, duly executed the lease and delivered possession of the premises to the lessees. During the term of the lease, the brother verbally invited his friend to share the house with the lessees. The friend agreed to pay part of the rent to the landlord, who did not object to this arrangement, despite a provision in the lease that provided that \"any assignment, subletting or transfer of any rights under this lease without the express written consent of the landlord is strictly prohibited, null, and void.\" The sister objected to the friend's moving in, even if the friend were to pay a part of the rent. When the friend moved in, the sister brought an appropriate action against the landlord, the brother, and the friend for a declaratory judgment that the brother had no right to assign. The brother's defense was that he and the sister were tenants in common for a term of years, and that he, the brother, had a right to assign a fractional interest in his undivided one-half interest. In this action, the sister will\nAnswer Choices:\nA. prevail, because a cotenant has no right to assign all or any part of a leasehold without the consent of all interested parties.\nB. prevail, because the lease provision prohibits assignment.\nC. not prevail, because she is not the beneficiary of the non-assignment provision in the lease.\nD. not prevail, because her claim amounts to a void restraint on alienation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n An assignment of a lease by a tenant occurs where the tenant transfers all his rights and duties under a lease to another party (an \"assignee\") for the entire length of time remaining on the lease. By contrast, a sublease is a transfer by a tenant to another party (a \"sublessee\") for a time period shorter than the time remaining on the lease. A landlord is free to place limits on alienation within the terms of the lease, thereby preventing its tenant from assigning, subletting, or both. Any such restriction will be strictly construed according to its explicit terms, and the landlord is considered the beneficiary of the clause's benefits. Further, if the landlord prohibited the tenant from assigning/subletting in the terms of the lease, but subsequently gave the tenant permission to do so despite the provision, that permission serves to forever waive the non-assignment/non-sublet clause. In this case, the landlord has waived the non-assignment/non-sublet provisions of the lease by accepting rent payments from the friend. Because the landlord is the beneficiary of that provision, the sister has no right to sue to enforce its terms, and answer C is correct.\n</s>"

Delivery of the deed and payment of the purchase price were to be made six months after the contract. The contract provided that Meadowacre was to be conveyed \"subject to easements, covenants, and restrictions of record.\" The contract was not recorded. After the contract was signed but before the deed was delivered, an electric company decided to run a high-voltage power line in the area and required an easement through a portion of Meadowacre. The landowner, by deed, granted an easement to the electric company in consideration of $5,000; the deed was duly recorded. The power line would be a series of towers with several high-voltage lines that would be clearly visible from the house on Meadowacre but would in no way interfere with the house. When the purchaser caused the title to Meadowacre to be searched, the deed of easement to the electric company was found. The landowner appeared at the time and place scheduled for the closing and proffered an appropriate deed to the purchaser and demanded the purchase price. The purchaser refused to accept the deed. In an appropriate action for specific performance against the purchaser, the landowner demanded $75,000. In this action, the landowner should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. obtain an order for specific performance at a price of $75,000.\nB. obtain an order for specific performance at a price of $70,000.\nC. lose, because the purchaser did not contract to take subject to the easement to the electric company.\nD. lose, because a high-voltage power line is a nuisance per se.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n In general, a seller is required to provide marketable title on the closing date. To be considered marketable, the title must be free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictive covenants and easements. This requirement may be waived by the parties, however, if they explicitly state they are doing so within the sale contract. In this case, the purchaser contracted to purchase Meadowacre \"subject to easements, covenants, and restrictions of record.\" That provision, however, will be construed to mean the encumbrances that were recorded at the time of contracting. Because the landowner caused the title to become further encumbered after the contract was entered, the purchaser is not required to perform. Therefore, answer C is correct, and answers A and B must be incorrect. Answer D is incorrect because nuisance is irrelevant to the determination of the parties' contractual rights.\n</s>"

Without the businessman's knowledge, a nearby farmer entered Brownacre in 1980 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse. The earthen dam trapped water that the farmer used to water a herd of cattle he owned. After twelve years of possession of Brownacre, the farmer gave possession of Brownacre to his oldest son. At the same time, the farmer also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to his son by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property. One year later, the son entered into a lease with the businessman to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, the son remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre. At that time the businessman conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to a friend. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years.

In this case, the farmer physically occupied the land for twelve years, did so without interruption, excluded others from possession, and did so without the busnessman's permission. Further, his construction of the dam clearly renders his use open and notorious. As such, the farmer has acquired title to the land through adverse possession. His title is unaffected by the subsequent leases and conveyances, as he has become the sole owner of the property. Therefore, answer A is correct.\n</s>"

Ann learned of the assignment and wrote to Brenda that she had no objection to the assignment to Carolyn and agreed to accept rent from Carolyn instead of Brenda.

Even after making an assignment, however, an assignor remains liable to the landlord for payments due on the lease. In this case, the facts indicate that Brenda assigned her entire interest to Carolyn. Although Brenda would normally remain liable to Ann for the remainder of the lease despite making the assignment, it appears that she has been released from liability by Ann's novation. A novation is an act that serves to substitute new parties for the original parties to an agreement, or substitutes new obligations between the original contract parties. Ann's acceptance of rent payments caused the non-assignment provision of the lease to be forever waived, and her letter to Brenda appears to constitute a novation substituting Carolyn for Brenda.

Upon the mother's death, her will devised Blackacre to \"my son and daughter.\" A week ago, a creditor obtained a money judgment against the son, and properly filed the judgment in the county where Blackacre is located. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered. The son needed cash, but the daughter did not wish to sell Blackacre. The son commenced a partition action against the daughter and the creditor. Assume that the court properly ordered a partition by judicial sale. After the sale, the creditor's judgment will be a lien on\nAnswer Choices:\nA. all of Blackacre.\nB. only a one-half interest in Blackacre.\nC. all of the proceeds of a sale of Blackacre.\nD. only the portion of the proceeds of sale due to the brother.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Unless the language of a conveyance indicates a clear intent to create a joint tenancy, the grantees will own the property as tenants in common.

The small house on Greenacre was occupied, with the farmer's oral permission, rent-free, by the farmer's son, and the college classmate of the farmer's son. The farmer's son was then 21 years old. The farmer, by properly executed instrument, conveyed Greenacre to \"my beloved son, his heirs and assigns, upon the condition precedent that he earn a college degree by the time he reaches the age of 30. If, for any reason, he does not meet this condition, then Greenacre shall become the sole property of my beloved daughter, her heirs and assigns.\" At the time of conveyance, the farmer's son and the college classmate attended a college located several blocks from Greenacre. Neither had earned a college degree. One week after the delivery of the deed to the farmer's son, the farmer's son recorded the deed and immediately told the college classmate that he was going to begin charging the college classmate rent since \"I am now your landlord.\" There is no applicable statute. The farmer's son and the college classmate did not reach an agreement, and the farmer's son served the appropriate notice to terminate whatever tenancy the college classmate had. The farmer's son then sought, in an appropriate action, to oust the college classmate. Who should prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The farmer's son, because the conveyance created a fee simple subject to divestment in the farmer's son.\nB. The farmer's son, because the farmer's conveyance terminated the college classmate's tenancy.\nC.

Although the farmer's son will become sole owner of the property if he succeeds in earning his degree before age 30, he has yet to meet that contingency. Therefore, the college classmate is still a tenant of the farmer, and answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The owner's deed to the buyer expressly granted a right-of-way over a specified strip of the owner's retained 40 acres, so the buyer could reach the town road. The deed was promptly and properly recorded. Last year, the buyer conveyed the back 40 acres to a doctor. They had discussed the right-of-way over the owner's land to the road, but the buyer's deed to the doctor made no mention of it. The doctor began to use the right-of-way as the buyer had, but the owner sued to enjoin such use by the doctor.

The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The owner and a buyer then entered into a valid written contract for the purchase and sale of Greenacre, which provided for the transfer of \"a marketable title, free of encumbrances.\" The contract did not expressly refer to the mortgage. Shortly after entering into the contract, the buyer found another property that much better suited her needs and decided to try to avoid her contract with the owner. When the buyer discovered the existence of the mortgage, she asserted that the title was encumbered and that she would not close. The owner responded by offering to provide for payment and discharge of the mortgage at the closing from the proceeds of the closing. The buyer refused to go forward, and the owner brought an appropriate action against her for specific performance. If the court holds for the owner in this action, it will most likely be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the mortgage is not entitled to priority because it was granted for preexisting obligations.\nB. the doctrine of equitable conversion supports the result.\nC.

To be considered marketable, the title must be free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictive covenants and easements. Where the contract does not state that \"time is of the essence,\" then the seller is required to provide marketable title within a reasonable time after the scheduled closing date. If the seller is able to do so, the buyer has no grounds for refusing to perform and the seller may sue for damages or specific performance. In this case, the owner has made arrangements that will render the title free of all encumbrances (the mortgage) at the closing. Therefore, the owner was entitled to bring an action for specific performance, and will succeed in that action because he can provide marketable title.\n</s>"

On each of their parcels was a low-rise office building. The two office buildings were of the same height. Last year the defendant decided to demolish the low-rise office building on her parcel and to erect a new high-rise office building of substantially greater height on the parcel as permitted by the zoning and building ordinances. She secured all the governmental approvals necessary to pursue her project. As the defendant's new building was in the course of construction, the plaintiff realized that the shadows it would create would place her (the plaintiff's) building in such deep shade that the rent she could charge for space in her building would be substantially reduced. The plaintiff brought an appropriate action against the defendant to enjoin the construction in order to eliminate the shadow problem and for damages. The plaintiff presented uncontroverted evidence that her evaluation as to the impact of the shadow on the fair rental value of her building was correct. There is no statute or ordinance (other than the building and zoning ordinances) that is applicable to the issues before the court. The court should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. grant to the plaintiff the requested injunction.\nB. award the plaintiff damages measured by the loss of rental value, but not an injunction.\nC. grant judgment for the defendant, because she had secured all the necessary governmental approvals for the new building.\nD. grant judgment for the defendant, because the plaintiff has no legal right to have sunshine continue to reach the windows of her building.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n While a landowners possess a number of rights with regard to their property, as well as the areas above and below it, there are no rights to sunlight, fresh air, or view.

The warehouse was built to the lot lines on all four sides. On the street side, recessed loading docks permitted semi-trailers to be backed in. After the tractors were unhooked, the trailers extended into the street and occupied most of one lane of the street. Over the years, as trailers became larger, the blocking of the street became more severe. The municipality advised the seller that the loading docks could not continue to be used because the trailers blocked the street; it gave the seller 90 days to cease and desist. During the 90 days, the seller sold and conveyed Blackacre by warranty deed for a substantial consideration to a buyer. The problem of the loading docks was not discussed in the negotiations.Upon expiration of the 90 days, the municipality required the buyer to stop using the loading docks. This action substantially reduced the value of Blackacre.The buyer brought an appropriate action against the seller seeking cancellation of the deed and return of all monies paid.

The facts do not indicate that the seller gave bad title. Answer C is incorrect because valuable consideration for the transaction was provided by both parties. Answer D is incorrect because the facts indicate that the seller was aware of the impending restriction on trailer use, so there was no mistake on the seller's part.\n</s>"

The lots were vacant and unproductive. They were held as a speculation that their value would increase. The land owner died and, by his duly probated will, devised the residue of his estate (of which Lots 1 and 2 were part) to his sister for life with remainder in fee simple to his niece. The land owner's executor distributed the estate under appropriate court order, and notified the sister that future real estate taxes on Lots 1 and 2 were her responsibility to pay. Except for the statutes relating to probate and those relating to real estate taxes, there is no applicable statute. The sister failed to pay the real estate taxes due for Lots 1 and 2. To prevent a tax sale of the fee simple, the niece paid the taxes and demanded that the sister reimburse her for same. When the sister refused, the niece brought an appropriate action against the sister to recover the amount paid. In such action, the niece should recover\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the amount paid, because a life tenant has the duty to pay current charges.\nB. the present value of the interest that the amount paid would earn during the sister's lifetime.\nC. nothing, because the sister's sole possession gave the right to decide whether or not taxes should be paid.\nD. nothing, because the sister never received any income from the lots.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The following estates are identified by the facts: the sister held a life estate, and the niece held a vested remainder. A life tenant has a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste relevant to the property during the life tenancy. Failures to keep the property in repair, to pay real estate taxes, or to pay interest on any mortgage on the property will all constitute permissive waste. That responsibility, however, is limited; it only extends as far as the amount of income the land generates. Therefore, while it is the sister's responsibility and not the niece's to pay the taxes, the sister is only responsible for paying taxes in an amount equal to the income she receives from the property, which in this case is $0. Because the niece has no recourse against the sister, answers A and B are incorrect and answer D is correct. Note that answer C is incorrect because possession is irrelevant to a life tenant's responsibilities - the sister is charged with those responsibilities whether she physically possesses the land or not.\n</s>"

For five years the farmer occupied Greenacre and conducted farming operations. The farmer never accounted to the rancher for any income, but the farmer did pay all real estate taxes when the taxes were due and kept the buildings located on Greenacre insured against loss from fire, storm, and flood. The rancher lived in a distant city and was interested only in realizing a profit from the sale of the land when market conditions produced the price the rancher wanted. The farmer died intestate, survived only by the farmer's sole heir. Thereafter, the sole heir occupied Greenacre but was inexperienced in farming operations. The result was a financial disaster. The sole heir failed to pay real estate taxes for two years. The appropriate governmental authority held a tax sale to recover the taxes due. At such sale the rancher was the only bidder and obtained a conveyance from the appropriate governmental authority upon payment of an amount sufficient to discharge the amounts due for taxes, plus interest and penalties, and the costs of holding the tax sale. The amount paid was one-third of the reasonable market value of Greenacre. Thereafter, the rancher instituted an appropriate action against the sole heir to quiet title in and to recover possession of Greenacre. The sole heir asserted all defenses available to her. Except for the statutes related to real estate taxes and tax sales, there is no applicable statute. In this lawsuit, the rancher is entitled to a decree quieting title so that the rancher is the sole owner in fee simple of Greenacre\nAnswer Choices:\nA. because the rancher survived the farmer.\nB. because the farmer's sole heir defaulted in the obligations undertaken by the farmer.\nC. unless the farmer's sole heir pays the rancher one-half of the reasonable market value of Greenacre.\nD. unless the farmer's sole heir pays the rancher one-half of the amount the rancher paid for the tax deed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This question requires you to understand the rights and duties of tenants in common. Co-tenants have a right to contribution from each other for certain expenditures such as taxes, mortgage payments and necessary repairs. This is logical considering that even though a co-tenant only owns part of the land, each of these expenditures must be paid in full - i.e. you cannot pay half of the taxes or mortgage payment on a property, or fix one-half of an item needing repair. An accounting is generally the means employed to determine each co-tenant's respective contribution rights. In this case, an accounting is unnecessary because the property is generating no income, and there is only one expenditure to divide - the cost of the tax deed. The farmer's sole heir must pay one-half of the cost of that deed if she wishes to retain her one-half interest in the property, so answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The landowner entered into a valid written agreement with a purchaser under which the landowner agreed to sell and the purchaser agreed to buy Greenacre by installment purchase. The contract stipulated that the landowner would deliver to the purchaser, upon the payment of the last installment due, \"a warranty deed sufficient to convey the fee simple.\" The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The purchaser entered into possession of Greenacre. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the purchaser discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on Greenacre, securing the payment of debt in the amount of 25% of the purchase price the purchaser had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the landowner had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the landowner. The value of Greenacre now is four times the amount on the debt secured by the mortgage. The purchaser quit possession of Greenacre and demanded that the landowner repay the amounts the purchaser had paid under the contract. After the landowner refused the demand, the purchaser brought an appropriate action against the landowner to recover damages for the landowner's alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the purchaser?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the time for the landowner to deliver marketable title has not arrived.\nB. No, because the purchaser assumed the risk by taking possession.\nC. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nD. Yes, because the risk of loss assumed by the purchaser in taking possession relates only to physical loss.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n In general, real estate purchases involve a period of several months between the time the contract is signed and the closing date. A seller is not required to provide marketable title until that closing date arrives. Under an installment contract, although the period between contracting and closing may be several years, the same rule regarding title still applies. In this case, the facts indicate that the parties have entered into an installment contract, and that upon the 300th payment, the deed would be delivered. Therefore, the landowner is not required to provide marketable title until the time arrives for the purchaser to make the 300th payment. Since there are still 290 payments to be made, the landowner's time for performance has not yet arrived, so answer A is correct.\n</s>"

The teacher brought an appriopriate action against the landowner to recover the teacher's expenses incurred in defending against the adjoining owner's action to quiet title to Blackacre. In this action, the court should decide for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the teacher, because in effect it was the landowner's title that was challenged.\nB. the teacher, because the landowner's deed to her included the covenant of warranty.\nC. the landowner, because the title the landowner conveyed was not defective.\nD. the landowner, because the adjoining owner may elect which of the landowner or the teacher to sue.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The covenant of warranty is a guarantee by the seller that the title being conveyed is marketable, and that the grantor will defend any valid claims against that title. A breach of the covenant of warranty is established when a third party interferes with possession of the land, not when a third party makes a claim against the grantee. Consequently, the grantor is not required to defend the grantee or his heirs in any action against title; rather, he must only defend against a wrongful claim or eviction. In this case, the facts do not indicate that any valid claim existed because the teacher prevailed over the adjoining owner in an action to quiet title. Because the landowner conveyed good title, and did not fail to defend against any valid claims that existed at the time of the conveyance, the landowner should prevail, and answer C is correct.\n</s>"

The landowner handed the instrument to the friend, saying, \"This is yours, but please do not record it until after I am dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives.\" Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed.

Six months later, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestate, survived by a daughter as his sole heir at law.

Delivery is a question of intent. The words of the landowner included \"this is yours,\" showing the necessary intent to strip himself of dominion and control over the deed and to immediately transfer the title.

A buyer gave the seller a signed handwritten offer to purchase the house. The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller's home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner's insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance. The buyer declared the contract voided by the fire, but the seller asserted a right to enforce the contract despite the loss. There is no applicable statute. If a court finds for the seller, what is the likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The contract was construed against the buyer, who drafted it.\nB. The lender's written commitment to make a mortgage loan to the buyer made the contract of sale fully binding on the buyer.\nC. The risk of loss falls on the party in possession, and constructive possession passed to the buyer on the contract date.\nD. The risk of loss passed to the buyer on the contract date under the doctrine of equitable conversion.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss goes to the party with the equitable title if the contract is silent. Equitable conversion occurs when the contract is capable of specific performance. This contract was silent regarding the risk of loss and there were no conditions to be met. The buyer thus had the equitable title at the time of the loss. If there is no statute, the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Act, which places the risk of loss on the one in possession, is not applicable. The court found for the seller, and thus the minority common law rule, which places the risk on the seller under these facts, is inapplicable. Thus, Answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her. After the farmer promptly and properly recorded that deed, the second bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the farm. The farmer denied the validity of the second bank's mortgage. Does the second bank continue to have a valid mortgage on the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of estoppel by deed.\nB. Yes, because the original owner reacquired title to the farm.\nC.

When the second bank failed to appear at the foreclosure proceeding, or to take any other action, the buyer at the sale received the title the farmer had at the time the mortgage was given to the first bank, which was free of any mortgage liens. The buyer and the farmer did not act in collusion, so there could be no claim of fraud when the farmer reacquired her original interest in the farm. Thus, Answer C is correct and Answer B is incorrect.\n</s>"

Rent was to be paid by the first day of each month, and the tenant paid the first month's rent at the time of the agreement. When the tenant arrived at the leased premises on July 1, the tenant learned that the previous tenant had not vacated the premises at the end of her lease term on May 31 and did not intend to vacate. The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession. The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. By suing the previous tenant for possession, the tenant elected that remedy in lieu of a suit against the landlord.\nB. The landlord had delivered the legal right of possession to the tenant.\nC.

The tenant had not notified the landlord before bringing the eviction action.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The landlord granted the legal right of possession to the tenant, which means that neither the landlord nor anyone holding of the landlord prevented the tenant from going into possession at the commencement of the lease term.

The cousin then entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to an investor with the closing to take place \"one week after [the cousin's] next birthday.\" The man failed to convey the farm to the cousin on her birthday. One week after the cousin's birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin's inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise. The investor considered suing the cousin but realized that she could not compel the cousin to convey the farm because it was still owned by the man. Two weeks after the cousin's birthday, the man died. Under his valid will, the man devised the farm to the cousin. Within a week, the executor of the man's estate gave the cousin an executor's deed to the farm in compliance with state law. The investor promptly learned of this transfer and demanded that the cousin convey the farm to her. The cousin refused. The investor sued the cousin for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The cousin, because the contract to convey was not signed by the legal owner of the farm as of the date of the contract and was therefore void.\nB. The cousin, because she received title by devise rather than by conveyance.\nC. The investor, because the contract to convey merged into the executor's deed to the cousin.\nD. The investor, because the contract to convey remained enforceable by her within a reasonable period of time after the proposed closing date.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The cousin and the investor had a valid contract for the sale of the farm.

The cousin acquired the land two weeks after the intended closing date, which was within a reasonable time period afterward.\n</s>"

The man took a deed to his attorney and told the attorney to deliver the deed to the nephew upon the man's death. The man also told the attorney to return the deed to him if he asked. None of these instructions to the attorney were in writing, and the deed was not recorded. The man then e-mailed the nephew informing him of the arrangement. Shortly thereafter, the nephew died testate. In his will, he devised the farm to his daughter. Several years later, the man died intestate, survived by two sons. The nephew's daughter immediately claimed ownership of the farm and demanded that the attorney deliver the deed to her. Must the attorney deliver the deed to the daughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a gratuitous death escrow is void unless supported by a written contract.\nB. No, because the man never placed the deed beyond his control.\nC. Yes, because the death of the nephew rendered the gratuitous death escrow irrevocable by the man.\nD.

Neither a written nor an oral contract is required for a valid death escrow, since most are gratuitous. To create a valid death escrow, however, the man had to place the deed beyond his control, reserving no power over it once it had been given to the attorney. Because the man instructed the attorney to return the deed to the man if he asked, the man did not place the deed beyond his control, and no death escrow was created.

The plan showed 90 one-acre lots and a ten-acre tract in the center that was designated \"Future Public School.\" The owner published and distributed a brochure promoting Happy Acres which emphasized the proximity of the lots to the school property and indicated potential tax savings \"because the school district will not have to expend tax money to acquire this property.\" There is no specific statute concerning the dedication of school sites.

An equitable servitude in a deed is only enforceable where a party can establish: 1) intent for the restriction to be enforceable by subsequent grantees, 2) that the subsequent grantee had notice of the servitude, and 3) that the restriction touches and concerns the land. In this case, the facts indicate that all three elements can be established. The express language of the deeds (referencing all lots within the 100 acre tract) clearly indicates the restriction is intended to bind subsequent grantees. The duly recorded subdivision plan and the deed language provide subsequent grantees with record notice of the restriction. And a restriction on what can and cannot be built on the land clearly meets the requirement that the restriction touch and concern that land, so the equitable servitude is enforceable. If the woman prevails, it will be on the basis of that enforceable servitude. Answer B is incorrect because the woman\u2019s rights as a taxpayer do not give her a legal interest in another's property. Answer C is incorrect because the woman is not a creditor beneficiary. Answer D is incorrect because whether the friend is a BFP is irrelevant to determining whether he is bound by the restriction.\n</s>"

The facts indicate that all four elements are present, so answer A is correct.

The facts, however, indicate that the subdivision plan was duly recorded, and that recording suffices to put the purchaser on notice. Answer D is also incorrect; the purchaser being a \"remote grantee\" is irrelevant to whether or not there is privity of estate.

The easement permitted the Water District to enter Barrenacres for only the stated purposes. The Water District promptly and properly recorded the deed. In 1961, the Water District installed a water main which crossed Barrenacres within the described strip; the Water District has not since entered Barrenacres. In 1965, the landowner sold Barrenacres to a purchaser, but the deed, which was promptly and properly recorded, failed to refer to the Water District easement. The purchaser built his home on Barrenacres in 1965, and since that time he has planted and maintained, at great expense in money, time, and effort, a formal garden area which covers, among other areas, the surface of the twenty-foot easement strip. In 2006, the Water District proposed to excavate the entire length of its main in order to inspect, repair, and replace the main, to the extent necessary. At a public meeting, at which the purchaser was present, the Water District announced its plans and declared its intent to do as little damage as possible to any property involved. The purchaser objected to the Water District plans. The purchaser asked his attorney to secure an injunction against the Water District and its proposed entry upon his property. The best advice that the attorney can give is that the purchaser's attempt to secure injunctive relief will be likely to\\\nAnswer Choices:\nA. succeed, because the purchaser's deed from the landowner did not mention the easement\nB. succeed, because more than forty years have passed since the Water District last entered Barrenacres.\nC. fail, because the Water District's plan is within its rights.\nD. fail, because the Water District's plan is fair and equitable.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The easement described in the facts is an express easement in gross. Unlike an easement appurtenant, which involves two plots of land, an easement in gross involves only one. The holder of an easement is entitled to reasonable use of that easement in accordance with whatever scope of use the express grant defined. Where the easement holder makes excessive use of the easement that is beyond its scope, the landowner may sue for an injunction preventing such use, but is not entitled to terminate the original grant. In this case, the facts indicate that the Water District may \"inspect, repair and replace\" portions of its pipeline. All of those tasks are explicitly permitted by the easement granted by the landowner in 1960. As such, the Water District's actions clearly constitute reasonable use and are within the scope of the easement. Therefore, answer C is correct.\n</s>"

A purchaser became interested in purchasing a lot but could not decide between Lot 40 and Lot 41. The price and fair market value of each of those two lots was $5,000. The purchaser paid the landowner $5,000, which the landowner accepted, and the landowner delivered to the purchaser a deed which was properly executed, complete, and ready for recording in every detail except that the space in the deed for the lot number was left blank. The landowner told the purchaser to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his decision and then to record the deed. The purchaser visited the development the next day and completely changed his mind, selecting Lot 25. He filled in Lot 25 and duly recorded the deed. The price of Lot 25 and its fair market value was $7,500. Immediately upon learning what the purchaser had done, the landowner brought an appropriate action against the purchaser to rescind the transaction. If the landowner loses, the most likely basis for the judgment is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The landowner's casual business practices created his loss.\nB. the need for certainty in land title records controls.\nC. the agency implied to complete the deed cannot be restricted by the oral understanding.\nD. the recording of the deed precludes any questioning of its provisions in its recorded form.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The only requirements that must be met for a conveyance of land to be valid (and thereby transfer legal title in that land from one party to another) are execution and delivery of the deed. The execution requirement is satisfied as long as the deed is signed by the party to be charged (the seller). Delivery of a deed is established by a proven intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. Execution and delivery of a deed, however, will not suffice to establish legal title where the deed fails to adequately identify the grantee to whom it was delivered and the exact plot of land it purports to convey. In this case, the facts indicate that the deed was executed (signed) by the landowner and delivered to the purchaser, who accepted it. By leaving blank the line indicating the exact plot number to be transferred, the landowner created an implied agency in the purchaser to fill in that line of the deed.\n</s>"

During the second month of occupancy, the tenant organized the other tenants in the building as a tenants' association, and the association made demands of the landlord concerning certain repairs and improvements the tenants wanted. When the tenant tendered rent for the third month, the landlord notified her that rent for the fourth and subsequent months would be $200 per month. The tenant protested and pointed out that all other tenants paid rent of $125 per month. Thereupon, the landlord gave the required statutory notice that the tenancy was being terminated at the end of the third month. By an appropriate proceeding, the tenant contests the landlord's right to terminate. If the tenant succeeds, it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. a periodic tenancy was created by implication.\nB. the doctrine prohibiting retaliatory eviction is part of the law of the jurisdiction.\nC. the $200 rent demanded violates the agreement implied by the rate charged to other tenants.\nD. the law implies a term of one year in the absence of any express agreement.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A leasehold agreement between a landlord and tenant creates a contractual obligation for both parties in relation to a specified piece of property. Specifically, a landlord is required to allow the tenant to possess the land once the lease commences, and the tenant is required to pay rent and refrain from committing waste. In this case, the tenant contends that the landlord has violated her rights under the lease by raising her rent above that of other tenants and by attempting to retake possession of the land. While the tenant is incorrect in arguing that all tenants must be charged the same rent, she may be able to prevent the landlord from retaking possession. The facts indicate that the landlord did not raise the rent or seek to end the tenancy until after the tenant organized a tenants association. As such, if the tenant prevails, it will be because the landlord is not allowed to evict her in retaliation for exercising her legal right to associate. Therefore, answer B is correct.\n</s>"

In an appropriate action to determine the title to Brownacre, the probable outcome will be that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The grantor was the owner of Brownacre, because the daughter was a donee and therefore could not acquire title by quitclaim deed.\nB. The grantor was the owner of Brownacre, because title to Brownacre reverted to her upon the voluntary destruction of the deed by the daughter.\nC. The daughter was the owner of Brownacre, because her destruction of the deed to Brownacre was under the undue influence of the grantor.\nD. The daughter was the owner of Brownacre, because the deed was merely evidence of her title, and its destruction was insufficient to cause title to pass back to the grantor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The only requirements for transferring legal title in land are execution and delivery of the deed. Execution occurs when the seller (the party to be charged) signs the deed. Delivery is effected by proving intent to pass title, even if the transferor never physically gives the title document to the transferee. It is the intent to pass title, not physical possession of the deed, that determines validity of a conveyance. Once title has been conveyed, the grantee can return it by executing and delivering a new deed back to the grantor, not by merely destroying the original deed. Here, the grantor intended to pass title to the daughter, physically delivered a deed to the daughter, and the daughter accepted it. The grantor's execution and delivery of the deed plus the daughter's acceptance of it transferred title to the daughter. Subsequent destruction of the physical deed is irrelevant to the daughter's ownership.\n</s>"

However, at the closing the painter did not carefully examine the deed and accepted a quitclaim deed without covenants of title. The painter later attempted to sell the land to a purchaser, who refused to perform because the landowner had conveyed an easement for a highway across the land before the painter bought the property. The painter sued the landowner for damages. Which of the following arguments will most likely succeed in the landowner's defense?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The existence of an easement does not violate the contract.\nB. The mere existence of an easement which is not being used does not give rise to a cause of action.\nC. The painter's cause of action must be based on the deed and not on the contract.\nD. The proper remedy is rescission of the deed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n This question requires you to understand the doctrine of merger. Where two parties contract for the purchase and sale of a plot of land, the seller is generally required to provide marketable title at the closing and to deliver the deed to the buyer who, presumably, will accept it. Once the buyer accepts the deed, the sale contract merges into the deed, and any contract provisions that were not memorialized in that deed are destroyed. In this case, as soon as the landowner and the painter's sale closed, and the painter accepted the quitclaim deed from the landowner, any contract provisions relating to covenants of title were destroyed. Therefore, the painter's only basis for a claim against landowner will arise from the deed, as the contract and all its provisions no longer exist.\n</s>"

No, because even in the absence of an express prohibition on assignment, a tenant may not assign without the landlord's permission.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n This question requires you to distinguish between an assignment and a sublease. An assignment of a lease by a tenant occurs where the tenant transfers all his rights and duties under a lease to another party (an \"assignee\") for the entire length of time remaining on the lease. By contrast, a sublease is a transfer by a tenant to another party (a \"sublessee\") for a time period shorter than the time remaining on the lease. A landlord is free to place limits on alienation within the terms of the lease, thereby preventing the tenant from re-assigining, subletting, or both. Any such restriction, however, will be strictly construed according to its explicit terms. In this case, the landlord has only prohibited the tenant from subletting. The restriction will be strictly construed, and since it does not state that assignment is prohibited, the tenant is free to assign his interest.\n</s>"

He obtained governmental approval (as required by applicable ordinances) and, between 1998 and 2000, he sold 140 of the lots, inserting in each of the 140 deeds the following provision: \"The grantee, for himself and his heirs, assigns and successors, covenants and agrees that the premises conveyed herein shall have erected thereon one single-family dwelling and that no other structure (other than a detached garage, normally incident to a single-family dwelling) shall be erected or maintained; and, further, that no use shall ever be made or permitted to be made than occupancy by a single family for residential purposes only.\" Because of difficulty encountered in selling the remaining lots for single family use, in January 2001, the owner advertised the remaining lots with prominent emphasis: \"These lots are not subject to any restriction and purchasers will find them adaptable to a wide range of uses.\" Suppose that the owner sold 50 lots during 2001 without inserting in the deeds any provision relating to structures or uses. A businessman purchased one of the 50 lots and proposes to erect a service station and to conduct a retail business for the sale of gasoline, etc. A woman purchased a lot from a man who had purchased from the owner in 1998, and the deed had the provision that it quoted in the fact situation. The woman brings suit to prevent the businessman from erecting the service station and from conducting a retail business. In the litigation between the woman and the businessman, which of the following constitutes the best defense for the businessman?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The owner's difficulty in selling with provisions relating to use establishes a change in circumstances which renders any restrictions which may once have existed unenforceable.\nB. Enforcement of the restriction, in view of the change of circumstances, would be an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\nC. Since the proof (as stated) does not establish a danger of monetary loss to the woman, the woman has failed to establish one of the necessary elements in a cause of action to prevent the businessman from using his lots for business purposes.\nD. The facts do not establish a common building or development scheme for the entire subdivision.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The restrictions in the deeds to first 140 lots sold constitute equitable servitudes. An equitable servitude in a deed is only enforceable where a party can establish: 1) intent for the restriction to be enforceable by subsequent grantees, 2) that the subsequent grantee had notice of the servitude, and 3) the restriction touches and concerns the land. In this case, the facts indicate that all three elements can be established. The express language of the deeds indicates the restriction is intended to bind subsequent grantees. The recording of those deeds would provide later purchasers with record notice of the restriction. And a restriction on what can be built on the land clearly meets the requirement that the restriction touch and concern that land, so an enforceable equitable servitude was created. That restriction, however, may only be enforced by and against owners of those 140 lots. Some students will incorrectly believe that a subdivision of 325 lots that are all bound by the same restrictions was created. But for an equitable servitude to bind an entire subdivision, it must be found in the common building plan for that subdivision. There is no such plan according to the facts presented - there was only a plan for lots 1 through 140. Because only the owner of a lot with a deed identifying the restriction may enforce that restriction, answer D presents the businessman's best argument. Answer A, B and C are all incorrect because the restrictions on lots 1 through 140 have no relevance to the businessman, who does not own one of those lots.\n</s>"

This is true regardless of whether the seller still physically possesses the land. That is because through the doctrine of equitable conversion, title to the property has been \"converted\" to the buyer through the operation of equitable principles. As such, where a buyer dies before closing, her estate equitably owns the property (because the buyer equitably owned it), and is required to pay for that property (just as the buyer would have been) at the closing.

He desires to develop the entire tract as a golf course, country club, and residential subdivision. He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club; the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate the landowner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold. The landowner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established: I. Aside from the country club and golf course, there will be no land use other than for residential use and occupancy in the 1,500 acres. II. The residents of the subdivision will have unambiguous rights and access to the club and golf course facilities. III. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right to transfer his lot to a purchaser with all original benefits. IV. Each lot owner must be obligated to pay annual dues to a pro rata share (based on the number of lots) of the club's annual operating deficit (whether or not such owner desires to make use of club and course facilities). Of the following, the greatest difficulty that will be encountered in establishing the scheme is that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. any judicial recognition will be construed as state action which, under current doctrines, raises a substantial question whether such action would be in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. the scheme, if effective, renders title unmarketable.\nC. one or more of the essential aspects outlined by the landowner will result in a restraint on alienation.\nD. there is a judicial reluctance to recognize an affirmative burden to pay money in installments and over an indefinite period as a burden which can be affixed to bind future owners of land.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This question is best approached by process of elimination. The fact pattern sets out the landowner's plan for developing the land he owns. The issue is not readily apparent because there are so many elements of the landowner's plan. The issue is only discernable by looking at the call of the question, which asks which choice would be the landowner's greatest obstacle to the success of the plan set out in the fact pattern. Of the four alternatives, only answer D is actually true under the facts.\n</s>"

Delivery of a deed is established by a proven intent to pass title, even if the title document was never physically given to the transferee. In this case, there is no dispute as to whether the deed was accepted by the buyer. However, it is unclear whether the deed can be considered \"executed,\" since it was the son, not the father, who signed it. Because the outcome of the suit will depend upon whether the son's powers of attorney included the power to execute the deed, answer D is correct.

In 1990 the owner platted and obtained all required governmental approvals of two subdivisions of 200 acres each. In 1990 and 1991 commercial buildings and parking facilities were constructed on one, Royal Center, in accordance with the plans disclosed by the plat for each subdivision. Royal Center continues to be used for commercial purposes. The plat of the other, Royal Oaks, showed 250 lots, streets, and utility and drainage easements. All of the lots in Royal Oaks were conveyed during 1990 and 1991. The deeds contained provisions, expressly stated to be binding upon the grantee, his heirs and assigns, requiring the lots to be used only for single-family, residential purposes until 2015. The deeds expressly stated that these provisions were enforceable by the owner of any lot in the Royal Oaks subdivision. At all times since 1979, the 200 acres of Royal Center have been zoned for shopping center use, and the 200 acres in Royal Oaks have been zoned for residential use in a classification which permits both single-family and multiple-family use. In an appropriate attack upon the limitation to residential use by single families, if the evidence disclosed no fact in addition to those listed above, the most probable judicial resolution would be that\nAnswer Choices:\nA. there is no enforceable restriction because judicial recognition constitutes state action which is in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nB. there is no enforceable restriction because of the owner's conflict of interest in that he did not make the restriction applicable to the 100 acres he retains.\nC. the restriction in use set forth in the deeds will be enforced at the suit of any present owner of a lot in Royal Oaks residential subdivision.\nD. any use consistent with zoning will be permitted but that any such uses that are in conflict with the restrictions in the deeds will give rise to a right to damages from the owner or the owner's successor.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The restrictions described in the facts constitute equitable servitudes. An equitable servitude in a deed is only enforceable where a party can establish: 1) intent for the restriction to be enforceable by subsequent grantees, 2) that the subsequent grantee had notice of the servitude, and 3) that the restriction touches and concerns the land. In this case, the facts indicate that all three elements can be established. The express language of the deeds indicates the restriction is intended to bind subsequent grantees.

For an equitable servitude to bind an entire subdivision, however, it must be found in the common building plan for that subdivision. If it is, then anyone who owns a plot of land within the subdivision is bound by the restrictions and may file suit to enforce those restrictions against other owners. In this case, the facts state that a subdivision plan outlining restrictions that would apply to all plats within it was approved by the local government. Because the restrictions were found in the common plan, owners may sue to enforce the restrictions, and answer C is correct.\n</s>"

To be considered \"marketable,\" the title must be free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictions, covenants, easements or other limiting provisions that are not explicitly identified in the contract. Further, in establishing whether an encumbrance exists with regard to local codes or ordinances, it is important to distinguish between building codes and zoning laws. A property being in violation of the building code is not considered an encumbrance, and title to that building is marketable. In contrast, where a property is in violation of zoning laws, the violation is considered an encumbrance and the title is unmarketable.\n</s>"

The will had no residuary clause. The owner was survived by his brother and by his daughter, who was the owner's sole heir.

There is no measuring life in Blackacre's condition and no means to ensure the conditions will vest or fail in a specific time frame. Consequently, the second clause granting the land to the Red Cross will be stricken, so answer D is incorrect.\n</s>"

The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. The owner conveyed Lot 1 to a man and Lot 2 to a woman. The owner retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. The woman, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on her lot. The woman's house included a large window on the side facing Lot 3. The window provided a beautiful view from her living room, thereby adding value to the woman's house. The man erected a house on his lot. The owner made no complaint to either the man or woman concerning the houses they built. After both the man and woman had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that one-half of the way was located on each lot. The man and woman exchanged right-of-way deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded. After the man and woman had lived in their respective houses for thirty years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3. The man informed the woman that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected the woman to do the same. At about the same time, the owner began the erection of a six-story apartment house on Lot 3. If the apartment house is completed, it will block the view from the woman's window and will substantially reduce the value of her lot. In an action brought by the woman to enjoin the owner from erecting the apartment building in such a way as to obstruct the view from the woman's living room window, the decision should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the woman, because the owner's proposed building would be an obstruction of the woman's natural right to an easement for light and air.\nB. the woman, because she was misled by the owner's failure to complain when the woman was building her house.\nC. the owner if, but only if, it can be shown that the owner's intention to erect such a building was made known to the woman at or prior to the time of the owner's conveyance to her.\nD. the owner, because the woman has no easement for light, air, or view.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n While a landowner possesses a number of rights with regard to their property, as well as the areas above and below it, there are no rights to sunlight, fresh air, or view. As such, the woman has no legal basis for a cause of action against the owner. Answer A is incorrect because the woman has no natural right to an easement for light and air, so there can be no obstruction of that right. Answer B is incorrect because reliance is irrelevant to determination of the woman's rights. Answer C is incorrect because intent is likewise irrelevant to determining those rights.\n</s>"

The landlord, duly executed the lease and delivered possession of the premises to the lessees. During the term of the lease, the brother verbally invited his friend to share the house with the lessees. The friend agreed to pay part of the rent to the landlord, who did not object to this arrangement, despite a provision in the lease that provided that \"any assignment, subletting or transfer of any rights under this lease without the express written consent of the landlord is strictly prohibited, null, and void.\" The sister objected to the friend's moving in, even if the friend were to pay a part of the rent. When the friend moved in, the sister brought an appropriate action against the landlord, the brother, and the friend for a declaratory judgment that the brother had no right to assign. The brother's defense was that he and the sister were tenants in common for a term of years, and that he, the brother, had a right to assign a fractional interest in his undivided one-half interest. In this action, the sister will\nAnswer Choices:\nA. prevail, because a cotenant has no right to assign all or any part of a leasehold without the consent of all interested parties.\nB. prevail, because the lease provision prohibits assignment.\nC. not prevail, because she is not the beneficiary of the non-assignment provision in the lease.\nD. not prevail, because her claim amounts to a void restraint on alienation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n An assignment of a lease by a tenant occurs where the tenant transfers all his rights and duties under a lease to another party (an \"assignee\") for the entire length of time remaining on the lease. By contrast, a sublease is a transfer by a tenant to another party (a \"sublessee\") for a time period shorter than the time remaining on the lease. A landlord is free to place limits on alienation within the terms of the lease, thereby preventing its tenant from assigning, subletting, or both. Any such restriction will be strictly construed according to its explicit terms, and the landlord is considered the beneficiary of the clause's benefits. Further, if the landlord prohibited the tenant from assigning/subletting in the terms of the lease, but subsequently gave the tenant permission to do so despite the provision, that permission serves to forever waive the non-assignment/non-sublet clause. In this case, the landlord has waived the non-assignment/non-sublet provisions of the lease by accepting rent payments from the friend. Because the landlord is the beneficiary of that provision, the sister has no right to sue to enforce its terms, and answer C is correct.\n</s>"

Delivery of the deed and payment of the purchase price were to be made six months after the contract. The contract provided that Meadowacre was to be conveyed \"subject to easements, covenants, and restrictions of record.\" The contract was not recorded. After the contract was signed but before the deed was delivered, an electric company decided to run a high-voltage power line in the area and required an easement through a portion of Meadowacre. The landowner, by deed, granted an easement to the electric company in consideration of $5,000; the deed was duly recorded. The power line would be a series of towers with several high-voltage lines that would be clearly visible from the house on Meadowacre but would in no way interfere with the house. When the purchaser caused the title to Meadowacre to be searched, the deed of easement to the electric company was found. The landowner appeared at the time and place scheduled for the closing and proffered an appropriate deed to the purchaser and demanded the purchase price. The purchaser refused to accept the deed. In an appropriate action for specific performance against the purchaser, the landowner demanded $75,000. In this action, the landowner should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. obtain an order for specific performance at a price of $75,000.\nB. obtain an order for specific performance at a price of $70,000.\nC. lose, because the purchaser did not contract to take subject to the easement to the electric company.\nD. lose, because a high-voltage power line is a nuisance per se.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n In general, a seller is required to provide marketable title on the closing date. To be considered marketable, the title must be free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictive covenants and easements. This requirement may be waived by the parties, however, if they explicitly state they are doing so within the sale contract. In this case, the purchaser contracted to purchase Meadowacre \"subject to easements, covenants, and restrictions of record.\" That provision, however, will be construed to mean the encumbrances that were recorded at the time of contracting. Because the landowner caused the title to become further encumbered after the contract was entered, the purchaser is not required to perform. Therefore, answer C is correct, and answers A and B must be incorrect. Answer D is incorrect because nuisance is irrelevant to the determination of the parties' contractual rights.\n</s>"

They thereby became tenants in common. Goodacre had never been used as anything except a residence. The brother had been residing on Goodacre with his father at the time his father died. The sister had been residing in a distant city. After their father's funeral, the brother continued to live on Goodacre, but the sister returned to her own residence. There was no discussion between the brother and the sister concerning their common ownership, nor had there ever been any administration of their father's estate. The brother paid all taxes, insurance, and other carrying charges on Goodacre. He paid no rent or other compensation to his sister, nor did his sister request any such payment. Thirty years later, a series of disputes arose between the brother and the sister for the first time concerning their respective rights to Goodacre. The jurisdiction where the land is located recognized the usual common-law types of cotenancies, and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. If the brother claims the entire title to Goodacre in fee simple and brings an action against the sister to quiet title, and if the state where the land is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, the decision should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the brother, because during the past 30 years the brother has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy the adverse possession requirements.\nB. the brother, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her right to inheritance.\nC. the sister, because there is no evidence that the brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute her ouster.\nD. the sister, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n This question highlights the need to carefully identify which facts relate to the principle of law being tested and which are superfluous. A cursory analysis of the question may lead some students to incorrectly choose answer A - the facts state that the brother has maintained possession for 30 years, and answer A suggests that the brother wins because he has acquired title by adverse possession. It is, however, ownership, not possession, that is relevant to answering the question presented. The brother and the sister's legal rights as tenants in common are unaffected by the degree to which they each physically possess the land. Although any one co-tenant has the right to possess the entire property, that possession in no way alters their ownership rights or those of the other co-tenants. Further, the brother has taken no action that could be characterized as adverse to his sister's possessory rights - he has made no attempt to prevent his sister's access to the land. Instead, the sister has simply chosen not to exercise her rights to physically possess the property yet. Since the brother has made no attempt to oust his sister from the land, her rights are unaffected by her physical absence, and answer C is correct.\n</s>"

The contract provided that \"[the seller] agrees to convey a good and marketable title to [the buyer] sixty days from the date of this contract.\" The purchase price was stated as $60,000. At the time set for closing the seller tendered a deed in the form agreed to in the contract. The buyer's examination of the record prior to the date of closing had disclosed, however, that the owner of record was not the seller. Further investigation by the buyer revealed that, notwithstanding the state of the record, the seller had been in what the buyer conceded as adverse possession for fifteen years. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years. The buyer refuses to pay the purchase price or to take possession \"because of the inability of the seller to transfer a marketable title.\" In an appropriate action by the seller against the buyer for specific performance, the seller will\nAnswer Choices:\nA. prevail, because he has obtained a \"good and marketable title\" by adverse possession.\nB. prevail, because the seller's action for specific performance is an action in rem even though the true owner is not a party.\nC. not prevail, because the buyer cannot be required to buy a lawsuit even if the probability is great that the buyer would prevail against the true owner.\nD. not prevail, because the seller's failure to disclose his lack of record title constitutes fraud.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The warranty of marketable title is implied in all land sale contracts. This warranty requires the seller to provide marketable title to the buyer on (but not before) the closing date. To be considered marketable, the title must be free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictions, covenants, easements or other limiting provisions that are not explicitly identified in the contract. A seller will not be expected to perform on the contract where doing so will require her to immediately enter a dispute over whether she holds good title. In this case, the facts indicate that the true owner is the record owner of Wideacre, and that the seller has apparently acquired title through adverse possession. The seller, however, had not obtained any judicial determination that he has acquired title to the land. The expense of filing or defending a suit to determine whether the buyer or the true owner holds good title will fall to the buyer, rather than the seller, if the purchase goes forward. Because the buyer will not be forced to \"buy\" this lawsuit along with the property, answer C is correct. Title need not be perfect, but it must be free of questions that present an unreasonable risk of litigation. Remember that on the MBE, title acquired by adverse possession is always unmarketable.\n</s>"

Under this written agreement, which was acknowledged and duly recorded, the miner, for a five-year-period, was given the privilege to enter on Stoneacre to remove sand, gravel, and stone in whatever quantities the miner desired. The miner was to make monthly payments to the owner on the basis of the amount of sand, gravel, and stone removed during the previous month. Under the terms of the agreement, the miner's privilege was exclusive against all others except the owner, who reserved the right to use Stoneacre for any purpose whatsoever including the removal of sand, gravel, and stone. One year after the agreement was entered into, the state brought a condemnation action to take Stoneacre for a highway interchange. In the condemnation action, is the miner entitled to compensation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because he has a license, which is a property right protected by the due process clause.\nB. Yes, because he has a profit a prendre, which is a property right protected by the due process clause.\nC. No, because he has a license, and licenses are not property rights protected by the due process clause.\nD. No, because he has a profit a prendre, which is not a property right protected by the due process clause.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The agreement between the owner and miner created a profit a prendre for the miner. A profit gives the holder a right to enter onto another's land for the purpose of removing some sort of natural resource. Rather than a license, a profit is a property right, and is thereby afforded all the usual statutory and constitutional protections associated with such rights. Because the miner has a property right in Stoneacre, a governmental taking will entitle the miner to share in any condemnation award given to the owner. Therefore, answer B is correct.\n</s>"

Without the businessman's knowledge, a nearby farmer entered Brownacre in 1980 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse. The earthen dam trapped water that the farmer used to water a herd of cattle he owned. After twelve years of possession of Brownacre, the farmer gave possession of Brownacre to his oldest son. At the same time, the farmer also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to his son by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property. One year later, the son entered into a lease with the businessman to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, the son remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre. At that time the businessman conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to a friend. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years.

In this case, the farmer physically occupied the land for twelve years, did so without interruption, excluded others from possession, and did so without the busnessman's permission. Further, his construction of the dam clearly renders his use open and notorious. As such, the farmer has acquired title to the land through adverse possession. His title is unaffected by the subsequent leases and conveyances, as he has become the sole owner of the property. Therefore, answer A is correct.\n</s>"

Ann learned of the assignment and wrote to Brenda that she had no objection to the assignment to Carolyn and agreed to accept rent from Carolyn instead of Brenda.

Even after making an assignment, however, an assignor remains liable to the landlord for payments due on the lease. In this case, the facts indicate that Brenda assigned her entire interest to Carolyn. Although Brenda would normally remain liable to Ann for the remainder of the lease despite making the assignment, it appears that she has been released from liability by Ann's novation. A novation is an act that serves to substitute new parties for the original parties to an agreement, or substitutes new obligations between the original contract parties. Ann's acceptance of rent payments caused the non-assignment provision of the lease to be forever waived, and her letter to Brenda appears to constitute a novation substituting Carolyn for Brenda.

At a time when the best friend was serving overseas with the United States Navy, the owner decided to sell Blackacre and spoke to his best friend's mother. Before the best friend sailed, he had arranged for his mother to become a joint owner of his various bank accounts so that she would be able to pay his bills when he was gone.

The owner had effectively imposed restrictive covenants on each lot in the 400 acres. A buyer offered the owner a good price for a five-acre tract located in a corner of Blackacre far away from the existing 400-acre residential subdivision. The owner conveyed the five-acre tract to the buyer and imposed the same restrictive covenants on the five-acre tract as he had imposed on the lots in the adjoining 400 acres. The owner further covenanted that when he sold the remaining 95 acres of Blackacre he would impose the same restrictive convenants in the deed or deeds for the 95 acres. The owner's conveyance to the buyer was promptly and properly recorded. However, shortly thereafter, the owner conveyed the remaining 95 acres to a businessman for $100,000 by a deed that made no mention of any restrictive convenants in the buyer's deed. The businessman now proposes to build an industrial park which would violate such restrictive covenants if they are applicable. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" In an appropriate action by the buyer to enforce the restrictive covenants against the businessman's 95-acre tract, if the businessman wins it will be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the deed imposing the restrictions was not in the chain of title for the 95 acres when the businessman bought them.\nB. the disparity in acreage means that the covenant can only be personal to the owner.\nC. negative reciprocal covenants are not generally recognized.\nD. a covenant to impose restrictions is an illegal restraint on alienation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The recording act quoted in the facts of this question is a notice act. To prevail under a notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded the deed without notice of earlier purchasers. When the businessman purchased the 95 acre portion of Blackacre, a title search on those 95 acres would not have revealed any deeds including a residential subdivision restriction. While the owner may have promised the buyer he would include such restrictions in the deeds for subsequent sales of Blackacre, he did not do so. Because the businessman purchased Blackacre without notice of any restrictive covenants affecting that land, no such covenants can be enforced against him, so answer A is correct. Answers B, C, and D are all incorrect statements of law.\n</s>"

Each of their lots had an office building. The defendant decided to raze the existing building on her lot and erect a building of greater height. The defendant had received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc.). After the defendant had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The defendant used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The plaintiff notified the defendant that cracks were developing in the building situated on the plaintiff's lot. The defendant took the view that any subsidence suffered by the plaintiff was due to the weight of the plaintiff's building, and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the plaintiff's soil been in its natural state. The defendant continued to excavate. The building on the plaintiff's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the plaintiff's action to recover damages from the defendant?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The defendant is liable, because she removed necessary support for the plaintiff's lot.\nB. The defendant cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\nC. Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the common-law right of lateral support.\nD. The defendant's only obligation was to satisfy all local, state, and federal safety regulations.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n A landowner has the right to lateral (side) support of its land from all neighboring parcels of land. This right, however, extends only to the land itself, not the structures built upon it. This means that if a landowner excavates its own land, and collapse of the neighboring land and a structure built on that land occurs, the excavating landowner is strictly liable only if the neighboring land would have collapsed even without the weight of the structure. In other words, the excavator must leave enough support in place that the neighboring land without any structures on it would not collapse. Otherwise, the excavator will only be liable for damages caused by her negligence.\n</s>"

The small house on Greenacre was occupied, with the farmer's oral permission, rent-free, by the farmer's son, and the college classmate of the farmer's son. The farmer's son was then 21 years old. The farmer, by properly executed instrument, conveyed Greenacre to \"my beloved son, his heirs and assigns, upon the condition precedent that he earn a college degree by the time he reaches the age of 30. If, for any reason, he does not meet this condition, then Greenacre shall become the sole property of my beloved daughter, her heirs and assigns.\" At the time of conveyance, the farmer's son and the college classmate attended a college located several blocks from Greenacre. Neither had earned a college degree. One week after the delivery of the deed to the farmer's son, the farmer's son recorded the deed and immediately told the college classmate that he was going to begin charging the college classmate rent since \"I am now your landlord.\" There is no applicable statute. The farmer's son and the college classmate did not reach an agreement, and the farmer's son served the appropriate notice to terminate whatever tenancy the college classmate had. The farmer's son then sought, in an appropriate action, to oust the college classmate. Who should prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The farmer's son, because the conveyance created a fee simple subject to divestment in the farmer's son.\nB. The farmer's son, because the farmer's conveyance terminated the college classmate's tenancy.\nC. The college classmate, because the farmer's permission to occupy preceded the farmer's conveyance to the farmer's son.\nD.

Although the farmer's son will become sole owner of the property if he succeeds in earning his degree before age 30, he has yet to meet that contingency.

The developer has now brought an appropriate action to quiet title against the testator's son, Fanny, and the school district.

The man and a neighbor executed a written document in which the man agreed to sell Blackacre to the neighbor and the neighbor agreed to buy Blackacre from the man for $100,000; the document did not provide for an earnest money down payment. The man recorded the document, as authorized by statute. The man orally gave the neighbor permission to park his car on Blackacre without charge prior to the closing. Thereafter, the neighbor frequently parked his car on Blackacre. Another property came on the market that the neighbor wanted more than Blackacre. The neighbor decided to try to escape any obligation to the man. The neighbor had been told that contracts for the purchase and sale of real property require consideration and concluded that because he had made no earnest money down payment, he could refuse to close and not be liable. The neighbor notified the man of his intention not to close and, in fact, did refuse to close on the date set for the closing.

Right off the bat, we see that B is a true statement of law, though it is very general. Therefore, we must check the other three to determine if there is a better choice available. In this question, answer A is incorrect because the performance the neighbor was obligated to make was paying the man $100,000 - use of the lot in no way constitutes a part performance of that payment. Answer C is incorrect because the doctrine of equitable conversion is irrelevant to the facts presented - it addresses who bears the risk for damage or destruction of a property after the sale contract is executed. Answer D is incorrect because the recording of the contract is irrelevant to the man's right to seek specific performance. Answer B is a correct statement of law, and having eliminated all three other choices we know that there is no better, more specific answer available. Therefore, it is clear that answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The owner's deed to the buyer expressly granted a right-of-way over a specified strip of the owner's retained 40 acres, so the buyer could reach the town road. The deed was promptly and properly recorded. Last year, the buyer conveyed the back 40 acres to a doctor. They had discussed the right-of-way over the owner's land to the road, but the buyer's deed to the doctor made no mention of it.

Therefore, answer B is correct and answer D is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because the buyer did not have an easement in gross.

Last year, the man replaced all of Blackacre's old windows with new windows. Each new window consists of a window frame with three inserts: regular windows, storm windows, and screens. The windows are designed so that each insert can be easily inserted or removed from the window frame without tools to adjust to seasonal change and to facilitate the cleaning of the inserts. The new windows were expensive. The man purchased them on credit, signed a financing statement, and granted a security interest in the windows to a vendor, the supplier of the windows. The vendor promptly and properly filed and recorded the financing statement before the windows were installed. The man stored the old windows in the basement of Blackacre. This year, the man has suffered severe financial reverses and has defaulted on his mortgage obligation to the bank and on his obligation to the vendor. The bank brought an appropriate action to enjoin the vendor from its proposed repossession of the window inserts. In the action, the court should rule for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The bank, because its mortgage was recorded first.\nB. The bank, because the windows and screens, no matter their characteristics, are an integral part of a house.\nC. The vendor, because the inserts are removable.\nD. The vendor, because the availabilty of the old windows enables the bank to return Blackacre to its original condition.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n Although the bank's mortgage has priority over the vendor's, whether the vendor can remove the windows depends upon whether they are regarded as fixtures. The bank's mortgage on the home will be limited to the structure and any items attached to it that have become fixtures. A court will consider the degree to which the item is attached, whether there will be damage to the structure if the item is removed, and whether general custom dictates that such an item stays with a property or goes out with the seller. Considering that there is a low degree of attachment (the inserts are \"easily removable\") and no damage will result from the removal, the inserts will not be considered fixtures and the vendor may enforce its lien. Therefore, answer C is correct, and A, B, and D are incorrect.\n</s>"

The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The owner and a buyer then entered into a valid written contract for the purchase and sale of Greenacre, which provided for the transfer of \"a marketable title, free of encumbrances.\" The contract did not expressly refer to the mortgage. Shortly after entering into the contract, the buyer found another property that much better suited her needs and decided to try to avoid her contract with the owner. When the buyer discovered the existence of the mortgage, she asserted that the title was encumbered and that she would not close. The owner responded by offering to provide for payment and discharge of the mortgage at the closing from the proceeds of the closing. The buyer refused to go forward, and the owner brought an appropriate action against her for specific performance. If the court holds for the owner in this action, it will most likely be because\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the mortgage is not entitled to priority because it was granted for preexisting obligations.\nB. the doctrine of equitable conversion supports the result.\nC. The owner's arrangements for the payment of the mortgage fully satisfied the owner's obligation to deliver marketable title.\nD. the existence of the mortgage was not the buyer's real reason for refusing to close.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n In general, a seller is required to provide marketable title on the closing date. To be considered marketable, the title must be free of encumbrances, such as mortgages, restrictive covenants and easements. Where the contract does not state that \"time is of the essence,\" then the seller is required to provide marketable title within a reasonable time after the scheduled closing date. If the seller is able to do so, the buyer has no grounds for refusing to perform and the seller may sue for damages or specific performance. In this case, the owner has made arrangements that will render the title free of all encumbrances (the mortgage) at the closing. Therefore, the owner was entitled to bring an action for specific performance, and will succeed in that action because he can provide marketable title.\n</s>"

His son paid no consideration. The son, who was 19 years old, without formal education, and without experience in business, took possession of Blackacre and operated the farm but neglected to record his deed. Subsequently, the doctor conveyed Blackacre to a buyer by warranty deed. The buyer, a substantial land and timber promoter, paid valuable consideration for the deed to him. He was unaware of the son's possession, his quitclaim deed, or his relationship to the doctor. The buyer promptly and properly recorded his deed and began removing timber from the land. Immediately upon learning of the buyer's actions, the son recorded his deed and brought an appropriate action to enjoin the buyer from removing the timber and to quiet title. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" In this action, the buyer should\nAnswer Choices:\nA. prevail, because a warranty deed for valuable consideration takes priority over a quitclaim deed without consideration.\nB. prevail, because the doctor's subsequent conveyance to the buyer revoked the gift to the son.\nC. lose, because the son's possession charged the buyer with notice.\nD. lose, because the equities favor the son.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The recording statute identified in the facts is a notice act. To prevail under a notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded his or her deed without notice of earlier purchasers. In this case, the facts state that the buyer was \"unaware of the son's possession.\" The buyer, however, is charged with inquiry notice by virtue of the fact that the son's possession and use of the land was open and notorious. Inquiry notice requires the buyer to make reasonable inquiries, and he is charged with knowing any information the inquiries would yield. Under this theory, the buyer's notice prevents him from being protected by the recording statute, so  Answer C is correct.\n</s>"

The financier entered into a binding written contract with a buyer for the sale and purchase of Greenacre for $125,000. The contract required the financier to convey marketable record title. The buyer decided to protect his interest and promptly and properly recorded the contract. Thereafter, but before the date scheduled for the closing, an old customer obtained and properly filed a final judgment against the financier in the amount of $1 million in a personal injury suit. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" The recording act of the jurisdiction authorizes recording of contracts and also provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" There are no other relevant statutory provisions. At the closing, the buyer declined to accept the title of the financier on the ground that the customer's judgment lien encumbered the title he would receive and rendered it unmarketable. The financier brought an appropriate action against the buyer for specific performance of the contract and joined the customer as a party. In this action, the judgment should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the financier, because in equity a purchaser takes free of judgment liens.\nB. the financier, because the contract had been recorded.\nC. the buyer, because the financier cannot benefit from the buyer's action in recording the contract.\nD. the buyer, because the statute creating judgment liens takes precedence over the recording act.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The recording statute identified in the facts is a notice act. To prevail under a notice act, a party must be a bona fide purchaser (\"BFP\") who recorded his or her deed without notice of earlier purchasers. To be a BFP, a party must give value for his or her interest in the land. In this case, the customer's interest arises from a judgment lien against the financier rather than payment of valuable consideration. Therefore, the buyer is protected against the customer (who is not a BFP) by the recording statute, and is receiving marketable title at the closing.

Last year the defendant decided to demolish the low-rise office building on her parcel and to erect a new high-rise office building of substantially greater height on the parcel as permitted by the zoning and building ordinances. She secured all the governmental approvals necessary to pursue her project. As the defendant's new building was in the course of construction, the plaintiff realized that the shadows it would create would place her (the plaintiff's) building in such deep shade that the rent she could charge for space in her building would be substantially reduced. The plaintiff brought an appropriate action against the defendant to enjoin the construction in order to eliminate the shadow problem and for damages.

After the tractors were unhooked, the trailers extended into the street and occupied most of one lane of the street. Over the years, as trailers became larger, the blocking of the street became more severe. The municipality advised the seller that the loading docks could not continue to be used because the trailers blocked the street; it gave the seller 90 days to cease and desist. During the 90 days, the seller sold and conveyed Blackacre by warranty deed for a substantial consideration to a buyer. The problem of the loading docks was not discussed in the negotiations. Upon expiration of the 90 days, the municipality required the buyer to stop using the loading docks. This action substantially reduced the value of Blackacre. The buyer brought an appropriate action against the seller seeking cancellation of the deed and return of all monies paid. Such action should be based upon a claim of\nAnswer Choices:\nA. misrepresentation.\nB. breach of the covenant of warranty.\nC. failure of consideration.\nD. mutual mistake.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n Because the buyer purchased the property in reliance on a misrepresentation made by the the seller, that misrepresentation will serve as the basis for the buyer's cause of action and answer A is correct. Answer B is incorrect because the seller has not breached the covenant of warranty - that is a covenant relating to the title to the property. The facts do not indicate that the seller gave bad title. Answer C is incorrect because valuable consideration for the transaction was provided by both parties. Answer D is incorrect because the facts indicate that the seller was aware of the impending restriction on trailer use, so there was no mistake on the seller's part.\n</s>"

Five years ago, the businessman and a scientist entered into a valid five-year written lease of Homeacre that included the following language: \"This house is rented as is, without certain necessary or useful items. The parties agree that the scientist may acquire and install such items as she wishes at her expense, and that she may remove them if she wishes at the termination of this lease.\" The scientist decided that the house needed, and she paid cash to have installed, standard-sized combination screen/storm windows, a freestanding refrigerator to fit a kitchen alcove built for that purpose, a built-in electric stove and oven to fit a kitchen counter opening left for that purpose, and carpeting to cover the plywood living room floor. Last month, by legal description of the land, the businessman conveyed Homeacre to a new owner for $100,000. The new owner knew of the scientist's soon-expiring tenancy, but did not examine the written lease. As the lease expiration date approached, the new owner learned that the scientist planned to vacate on schedule, and learned for the first time that she claimed and planned to remove all of the above-listed items that she had installed. The new owner promptly brought an appropriate action to enjoin the scientist from removing those items. The court should decide that the scientist may remove\nAnswer Choices:\nA. none of the items.\nB. only the refrigerator.\nC. all items except the carpet.\nD. all of the items.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This question deals with whether or not any of the items that the scientist installed have become fixtures. The general rule is that if an improvement qualifies as a fixture, it may not be removed. If, however, there is an agreement between an owner and tenant as to what the tenant may install and/or remove, that agreement will be given effect. The facts state that the scientist and the businessman entered an agreement (as part of the lease) that she would be free to remove any items that she installed upon termination of her lease. Therefore, answer D is correct, and answers A, B, and C are incorrect.Had there not been an agreement that was dispositive, the court would consider the degree to which an item is attached, whether there will be damage to the structure if the item is removed, and whether general custom dictates that such an item stays with a property or goes out with the seller.\n</s>"

The owner told her nephew, who was then 19, about the deed and said that she would give it to him when he reached 21 and had received his undergraduate college degree. Shortly afterward the nephew searched the owner's desk, found and removed the deed, and recorded it. A month later, the nephew executed an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey Richacre to his fiancee. He delivered the deed reciting that it was given in exchange for \"$1 and other good and valuable consideration,\" and explained that to make it valid the fiancee must pay him $1. The fiancee, impressed and grateful, did so. Together, they went to the recording office and recorded the deed. The fiancee assumed the nephew had owned Richacre, and knew nothing about the nephew's dealing with the owner. Neither the owner's deed to the nephew nor the nephew's deed to his fiancee mentioned anything about any conditions. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" Two years passed. The nephew turned 21, then graduated from college. At the graduation party, the owner was chatting with the fiancee and for the first time learned the foregoing facts.The age of majority in the jurisdiction is 18 years old. The owner brought an appropriate action against the fiancee to quiet title to Richacre.

In this case, it is clear from the facts that the owner's intent was that title would not pass to the nephew until he reached age 21 and had earned a college degree. The nephew's physical possession of and recording of the deed contrary to the owner's intent does not negate that intent. Therefore, the deed was never delivered to the nephew, and answer B is correct.\n</s>"

The carpenter made the installment payments on the mortgage regularly until last year. Then the carpenter persuaded a friend to buy Goldacre, subject to the mortgage to the bank. They expressly agreed that the friend would not assume and agree to pay the carpenter's debt to the bank. The carpenter's mortgage to the bank contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking the bank's consent, the carpenter conveyed Goldacre to the friend, the deed stating in pertinent part \". . . subject to a mortgage to the bank [giving details and recording data].\" The friend took possession of Goldacre and made several mortgage payments, which the bank accepted. Now, however, neither the friend nor the carpenter has made the last three mortgage payments. The bank has brought an appropriate action against the friend for the amount of the delinquent payments. In this action, judgment should be for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the friend, because she did not assume and agree to pay the carpenter's mortgage debt.\nB. the friend, because she is not in privity of estate with the bank.\nC. the bank, because the carpenter's deed to the friend violated the due-on-sale clause.\nD. the bank, because the friend is in privity of estate with the bank.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The mortgagor of a property is generally free to transfer title to that property BUT: 1) the mortgagor remains personally liable on the mortgage, and 2) all subsequent grantees take the property subject to the mortgage. Further, subsequent grantees do not become personally liable on the mortgage unless they explicitly assume the mortgage. Therefore, the mortgagor will always be personally liable on the mortgage, all subsequent grantees who assume the mortgage will be personally liable on it, and all subsequent grantees (whether they assume the mortgage or not) can lose the property through foreclosure if the mortgage is not paid. The facts state that the friend did not assume the mortgage, so she has no personal liability to the bank with regard to mortgage payments. Although she voluntarily made such payments for a few months, she was under no obligation to do so. Therefore, answer A is correct. The bank, however, has the right to foreclose on the mortgage if the payments are not made, so the friend stands to lose the property unless either she or the carpenter makes the payments. Further, the carpenter's conveyance without the bank's permission allows the bank, pursuant to the due-on-sale clause, to demand immediate payment of the entire outstanding mortgage balance.\n</s>"

The lots were vacant and unproductive. They were held as a speculation that their value would increase. The land owner died and, by his duly probated will, devised the residue of his estate (of which Lots 1 and 2 were part) to his sister for life with remainder in fee simple to his niece. The land owner's executor distributed the estate under appropriate court order, and notified the sister that future real estate taxes on Lots 1 and 2 were her responsibility to pay. Except for the statutes relating to probate and those relating to real estate taxes, there is no applicable statute. The sister failed to pay the real estate taxes due for Lots 1 and 2. To prevent a tax sale of the fee simple, the niece paid the taxes and demanded that the sister reimburse her for same. When the sister refused, the niece brought an appropriate action against the sister to recover the amount paid. In such action, the niece should recover\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the amount paid, because a life tenant has the duty to pay current charges.\nB. the present value of the interest that the amount paid would earn during the sister's lifetime.\nC. nothing, because the sister's sole possession gave the right to decide whether or not taxes should be paid.\nD. nothing, because the sister never received any income from the lots.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The following estates are identified by the facts: the sister held a life estate, and the niece held a vested remainder. A life tenant has a duty not to commit voluntary or permissive waste relevant to the property during the life tenancy. Failures to keep the property in repair, to pay real estate taxes, or to pay interest on any mortgage on the property will all constitute permissive waste. That responsibility, however, is limited; it only extends as far as the amount of income the land generates. Therefore, while it is the sister's responsibility and not the niece's to pay the taxes, the sister is only responsible for paying taxes in an amount equal to the income she receives from the property, which in this case is $0. Because the niece has no recourse against the sister, answers A and B are incorrect and answer D is correct. Note that answer C is incorrect because possession is irrelevant to a life tenant's responsibilities - the sister is charged with those responsibilities whether she physically possesses the land or not.\n</s>"

For five years the farmer occupied Greenacre and conducted farming operations. The farmer never accounted to the rancher for any income, but the farmer did pay all real estate taxes when the taxes were due and kept the buildings located on Greenacre insured against loss from fire, storm, and flood. The rancher lived in a distant city and was interested only in realizing a profit from the sale of the land when market conditions produced the price the rancher wanted. The farmer died intestate, survived only by the farmer's sole heir. Thereafter, the sole heir occupied Greenacre but was inexperienced in farming operations. The result was a financial disaster. The sole heir failed to pay real estate taxes for two years. The appropriate governmental authority held a tax sale to recover the taxes due. At such sale the rancher was the only bidder and obtained a conveyance from the appropriate governmental authority upon payment of an amount sufficient to discharge the amounts due for taxes, plus interest and penalties, and the costs of holding the tax sale. The amount paid was one-third of the reasonable market value of Greenacre. Thereafter, the rancher instituted an appropriate action against the sole heir to quiet title in and to recover possession of Greenacre. The sole heir asserted all defenses available to her. Except for the statutes related to real estate taxes and tax sales, there is no applicable statute. In this lawsuit, the rancher is entitled to a decree quieting title so that the rancher is the sole owner in fee simple of Greenacre\nAnswer Choices:\nA. because the rancher survived the farmer.\nB. because the farmer's sole heir defaulted in the obligations undertaken by the farmer.\nC. unless the farmer's sole heir pays the rancher one-half of the reasonable market value of Greenacre.\nD. unless the farmer's sole heir pays the rancher one-half of the amount the rancher paid for the tax deed.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n This question requires you to understand the rights and duties of tenants in common. Co-tenants have a right to contribution from each other for certain expenditures such as taxes, mortgage payments and necessary repairs. This is logical considering that even though a co-tenant only owns part of the land, each of these expenditures must be paid in full - i.e. you cannot pay half of the taxes or mortgage payment on a property, or fix one-half of an item needing repair. An accounting is generally the means employed to determine each co-tenant's respective contribution rights. In this case, an accounting is unnecessary because the property is generating no income, and there is only one expenditure to divide - the cost of the tax deed. The farmer's sole heir must pay one-half of the cost of that deed if she wishes to retain her one-half interest in the property, so answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The landowner entered into a valid written agreement with a purchaser under which the landowner agreed to sell and the purchaser agreed to buy Greenacre by installment purchase. The contract stipulated that the landowner would deliver to the purchaser, upon the payment of the last installment due, \"a warranty deed sufficient to convey the fee simple.\" The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. The purchaser entered into possession of Greenacre. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, the purchaser discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on Greenacre, securing the payment of debt in the amount of 25% of the purchase price the purchaser had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that the landowner had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of the landowner. The value of Greenacre now is four times the amount on the debt secured by the mortgage. The purchaser quit possession of Greenacre and demanded that the landowner repay the amounts the purchaser had paid under the contract. After the landowner refused the demand, the purchaser brought an appropriate action against the landowner to recover damages for the landowner's alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to the purchaser?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the time for the landowner to deliver marketable title has not arrived.\nB. No, because the purchaser assumed the risk by taking possession.\nC. Yes, because in the absence of a contrary express agreement, an obligation to convey marketable title is implied.\nD. Yes, because the risk of loss assumed by the purchaser in taking possession relates only to physical loss.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n In general, real estate purchases involve a period of several months between the time the contract is signed and the closing date. A seller is not required to provide marketable title until that closing date arrives. Under an installment contract, although the period between contracting and closing may be several years, the same rule regarding title still applies. In this case, the facts indicate that the parties have entered into an installment contract, and that upon the 300th payment, the deed would be delivered. Therefore, the landowner is not required to provide marketable title until the time arrives for the purchaser to make the 300th payment. Since there are still 290 payments to be made, the landowner's time for performance has not yet arrived, so answer A is correct.\n</s>"

The teacher demanded that the landowner defend the teacher's title under the deed's covenant of warranty, but the landowner refused. The teacher then successfully defended at her own expense. The teacher brought an appriopriate action against the landowner to recover the teacher's expenses incurred in defending against the adjoining owner's action to quiet title to Blackacre. In this action, the court should decide for\nAnswer Choices:\nA. the teacher, because in effect it was the landowner's title that was challenged.\nB. the teacher, because the landowner's deed to her included the covenant of warranty.\nC. the landowner, because the title the landowner conveyed was not defective.\nD. the landowner, because the adjoining owner may elect which of the landowner or the teacher to sue.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The covenant of warranty is a guarantee by the seller that the title being conveyed is marketable, and that the grantor will defend any valid claims against that title. A breach of the covenant of warranty is established when a third party interferes with possession of the land, not when a third party makes a claim against the grantee. Consequently, the grantor is not required to defend the grantee or his heirs in any action against title; rather, he must only defend against a wrongful claim or eviction. In this case, the facts do not indicate that any valid claim existed because the teacher prevailed over the adjoining owner in an action to quiet title. Because the landowner conveyed good title, and did not fail to defend against any valid claims that existed at the time of the conveyance, the landowner should prevail, and answer C is correct.\n</s>"

During the landowner's lifetime, the landowner conveyed the easterly half (East Peterhill), situated in one municipality, to a farmer, and the westerly half (West Peterhill), situated in a different municipality, to a teacher. Each of the conveyances, which were promptly and properly recorded, contained the following language: The parties agree for themselves and their heirs and assigns that the premises herein conveyed shall be used only for residential purposes; that each lot created within the premises herein conveyed shall contain not less than five acres; and that each lot shall have not more than one single-family dwelling. This agreement shall bind all successor owners of all or any portion of Peterhill and any owner of any part of Peterhill may enforce this covenant. After the landowner's death, the farmer desired to build houses on one-half acre lots in the East Peterhill tract as authorized by current applicable zoning and building codes in its municipality. The area surrounding East Peterhill in the municipality was developed as a residential community with homes built on one-half acre lots. West Peterhill was in a residential area covered by the other municipality's zoning code, which allowed residential development only on five-acre tracts of land. In an appropriate action brought by the teacher to enjoin the farmer's proposed construction on one-half acre lots, the court will find the quoted restriction to be\nAnswer Choices:\nA. invalid, because of the change of circumstance in the neighborhood.\nB. invalid, because it conflicts with the applicable zoning code.\nC. valid, but only so long as the original grantees from the landowner own their respective tracts of Peterhill.\nD. valid, because the provision imposed an equitable servitude.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n The restriction described in the facts constitutes an equitable servitude. An equitable servitude in a deed is only enforceable where a party can establish: 1) intent for the restriction to be enforceable by subsequent grantees; 2) that the subsequent grantees had notice of the servitude; and 3) that the restriction touches and concerns the land. In this case, the language of the deeds (\"this agreement shall bind all successor owners...[and they] may enforce this covenant\") clearly indicates that the servitude is intended to bind and be enforceable by subsequent grantees. Further, the prompt and proper recording of the deeds by the farmer and the teacher provides record notice of the servitude. And a restriction on the number and type of buildings that may be erected on each plot will surely be construed to touch and concern those plots. Therefore, the teacher will prevail, and answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The man has kept the lawns and trees on Townacres trimmed and neat. The woman \"lets nature take its course\" at Greenacres. The result on Greenacres is a tangle of underbrush, fallen trees, and standing trees that are in danger of losing limbs. Many of the trees on Greenacres are near Townacres. In the past, debris and large limbs have been blown from Greenacres onto Townacres. By local standards Greenacres is an eyesore that depresses market values of real property in the vicinity, but the condition of Greenacres violates no applicable laws or ordinances. The man demanded that the woman keep the trees near Townacres trimmed. The woman refused. The man brought an appropriate action against the woman to require her to abate what the man alleges to be a nuisance. In the lawsuit, the only issue is whether the condition of Greenacres constitutes a nuisance. The strongest argument that the man can present is that the condition of Greenacres\nAnswer Choices:\nA. has an adverse impact on real estate values.\nB. poses a danger to the occupants of Townacres.\nC. violates community aesthetic standards.\nD. cannot otherwise be challenged under any law or ordinance.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n Some of the most basic sticks in the bundle of property rights are those relating to use of one's land. A property owner, whether an individual or a commercial entity, is entitled to make reasonable use of its property. An owner is likewise entitled to use and enjoy their land without invasions of that use and enjoyment by the activities of other owners. In this case, the facts indicate that the woman has allowed the foliage on her lot to become overgrown. Determining the parties' respective rights requires a balancing between the woman's right to use her property as she wishes on the one hand, and the man's right to quiet enjoyment of his property on the other. For the man to prevail, he must establish that the woman's use of her land constitutes an unreasonable interference with his use of his own land. This interference, however, must be based on more than mere aesthetics or market value considerations. The man must show that a more serious interference is occurring as a result of the woman's actions, such as a threat to the safety of those on his land. Therefore, answer B represents the man's strongest argument. Answers A and C are incorrect because they do not state a basis for a private nuisance claim. Answer D is incorrect because a nuisance claim is not warranted by the mere absence of other available claims.\n</s>"

The lease provided for $700 monthly rental. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term, until he moved to a new job in another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his \"lease rights\" for the remaining nine months of the lease. The friend made the next four monthly $700 rental payments to the landlord. For the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left of the lease term. The landlord was on an extended trip abroad, and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until last week. The landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally, for $3,500 for the last five months' rent. What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the tenant and the friend are liable for the full $3,500, because the tenant is liable on privity of contract and the friend is liable on privity of estate as assignee.\nB. The friend is liable for $1,400 on privity of estate, which lasted only until he vacated, and the tenant is liable for $2,100 on privity of contract and estate for the period after the friend vacated.\nC. The friend is liable for $3,500 on privity of estate and the tenant is not liable, because the landlord's failure to object to the friend's payment of rent relieved the tenant of liability.\nD. The tenant is liable for $3,500 on privity of contract and the friend is not liable, because a sublessee does not have personal liability to the original landlord.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n An assignment arises when a tenant transfers all or some of the leased premises to another for the remainder of the lease term, retaining no interest in the assigned premises. In this case, prior to the agreement with the friend, the tenant had privity of contract with the landlord because of the lease. The tenant also had privity of estate because the tenant was in possession of the apartment. Subsequently, an assignment arose when the tenant transferred the premises to the friend for the remainder of the lease term of nine months. The friend was then in privity of estate with the landlord as to all promises that run with the land, including the covenant to pay rent. The tenant was not released by the landlord, however, and thus remained liable on privity of contract. Thus, Answer A is correct.\n</s>"

The landowner handed the instrument to the friend, saying, \"This is yours, but please do not record it until after I am dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives.\" Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed. The friend said that he would destroy the deed and a day or so later falsely told the landowner that the deed had been destroyed. Six months later, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestate, survived by a daughter as his sole heir at law. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him. As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land.

In addition, handing the deed to the grantee raises a rebuttable presumption of delivery. Recording the deed is not required and thus the request not to record the document until later is irrelevant so long as delivery was present.\n</s>"

Two years later, the debtor purchased land in the county and promptly and properly recorded the warranty deed to it. Subsequently, the debtor borrowed $30,000 from his aunt, signing a promissory note for that amount, which note was secured by a mortgage on the land. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The aunt failed to make a title search before making the loan. The debtor made no payment to the creditor and defaulted on the mortgage loan from his aunt. A valid judicial foreclosure proceeding was held, in which the creditor, the aunt, and the debtor were named parties. A dispute arose as to which lien has priority.

The contract had no contingencies and was silent as to risk of loss if there were damage to, or destruction of, property improvements between contract and closing, and as to any duty to carry insurance. As soon as the parties signed the contract, the seller (who had already moved out) canceled her insurance covering the land. The buyer did not know this and did not obtain insurance. A few days later, three weeks before the agreed closing date, the building on the land was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. There is no applicable statute. In an appropriate action, the buyer asserted the right to cancel the contract and to recover his earnest money. The seller said the risk of fire loss passed to the buyer before the fire, so the buyer must perform. If the seller prevails, what is the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Once the parties signed the contract, only the buyer had an insurable interest and so could have protected against this loss.\nB. The buyer's constructive possession arising from the contract gave him the affirmative duty of protecting against loss by fire.\nC.

On nights of athletic events, the woman and her family members wore earplugs and could not sleep or enjoy a quiet evening until after 10 p.m. In addition, light from the stadium on those nights was bright enough to allow reading a newspaper in the woman's yard.

Several years later, the man sold his residence. As provided by the contract of sale, the deed to the buyer provided that the buyer agreed \"to assume the existing mortgage debt\" on the residence. Subsequently, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage loan to the bank, and appropriate foreclosure proceedings were initiated. The foreclosure sale resulted in a deficiency. There is no applicable statute. Is the buyer liable for the deficiency?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because even if the buyer assumed the mortgage, the seller is solely responsible for any deficiency.\nB. No, because the buyer did not sign a promissory note to the bank and therefore has no personal liability.\nC. Yes, because the buyer assumed the mortgage and therefore became personally liable for the mortgage loan and any deficiency.\nD.

A buyer gave the seller a signed handwritten offer to purchase the house. The offer was unconditional and sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and when the seller signed an acceptance an enforceable contract resulted. The house on the land had been the seller's home, but he had moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times relevant to the proposed transaction. Two weeks after the parties had entered into their contract, one week after the buyer had obtained a written mortgage lending commitment from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing date, the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The loss was not insured, because three years earlier, the seller had let his homeowner's insurance policy lapse after he had paid his mortgage debt in full. The handwritten contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of loss, and insurance. The buyer declared the contract voided by the fire, but the seller asserted a right to enforce the contract despite the loss. There is no applicable statute. If a court finds for the seller, what is the likely reason?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The contract was construed against the buyer, who drafted it.\nB. The lender's written commitment to make a mortgage loan to the buyer made the contract of sale fully binding on the buyer.\nC. The risk of loss falls on the party in possession, and constructive possession passed to the buyer on the contract date.\nD. The risk of loss passed to the buyer on the contract date under the doctrine of equitable conversion.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nD\n\n## Explanation\n Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss goes to the party with the equitable title if the contract is silent. Equitable conversion occurs when the contract is capable of specific performance. This contract was silent regarding the risk of loss and there were no conditions to be met. The buyer thus had the equitable title at the time of the loss. If there is no statute, the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Act, which places the risk of loss on the one in possession, is not applicable. The court found for the seller, and thus the minority common law rule, which places the risk on the seller under these facts, is inapplicable. Thus, Answer D is correct.\n</s>"

The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage, which contained a due-on-sale provision. A few years later, the farmer borrowed $5,000 from a second bank and gave it a promissory note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The bank promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. Subsequently, the farmer defaulted on her obligation to the first bank, which then validly accelerated the debt and instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings as permitted by the jurisdiction. The second bank received notice of the foreclosure sale but did not send a representative to the sale. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer who was not acting in collusion with the farmer outbid all other bidders and received a deed to the farm. Several months later, the original farmer repurchased her farm from the buyer, who executed a warranty deed transferring the farm to her. After the farmer promptly and properly recorded that deed, the second bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the farm. The farmer denied the validity of the second bank's mortgage. Does the second bank continue to have a valid mortgage on the farm?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of estoppel by deed.\nB. Yes, because the original owner reacquired title to the farm.\nC. No, because the purchase at the foreclosure sale by the buyer under these facts eliminated the second bank's junior mortgage lien.\nD. No, because of the due-on-sale provision in the farmer's mortgage to the first bank.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nC\n\n## Explanation\n The first bank had priority. The second bank was a necessary party to the foreclosure proceeding and was given notice of the sale. When the second bank failed to appear at the foreclosure proceeding, or to take any other action, the buyer at the sale received the title the farmer had at the time the mortgage was given to the first bank, which was free of any mortgage liens. The buyer and the farmer did not act in collusion, so there could be no claim of fraud when the farmer reacquired her original interest in the farm.

The mortgage provided that the bank could, at its option, declare the entire loan due and payable if all or any part of the land, or an interest therein, was sold or transferred without the bank's prior written consent. Subsequently, the landowner wanted to sell the land to a neighbor by an installment land contract, but the bank refused to consent.

The landowner and the neighbor consulted an attorney about their proposed transaction, their desire to complete it, and the bank's refusal to consent.

Rent was to be paid by the first day of each month, and the tenant paid the first month's rent at the time of the agreement. When the tenant arrived at the leased premises on July 1, the tenant learned that the previous tenant had not vacated the premises at the end of her lease term on May 31 and did not intend to vacate. The tenant then successfully sued the previous tenant for possession. The tenant did not inform the landlord of the eviction action until after the tenant received possession. The tenant then sued the landlord, claiming damages for that portion of the lease period during which the tenant was not in possession. If the court finds for the landlord, what will be the most likely explanation?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The cousin then entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to an investor with the closing to take place \"one week after [the cousin's] next birthday.\" The man failed to convey the farm to the cousin on her birthday. One week after the cousin's birthday, on the intended closing date, the investor first learned of the cousin's inability to convey the farm because the man had breached his promise. The investor considered suing the cousin but realized that she could not compel the cousin to convey the farm because it was still owned by the man. Two weeks after the cousin's birthday, the man died. Under his valid will, the man devised the farm to the cousin. Within a week, the executor of the man's estate gave the cousin an executor's deed to the farm in compliance with state law.

Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The cousin, because the contract to convey was not signed by the legal owner of the farm as of the date of the contract and was therefore void.\nB. The cousin, because she received title by devise rather than by conveyance.\nC. The investor, because the contract to convey merged into the executor's deed to the cousin.\nD.

A year later, the landowner conveyed the same tract to a developer by a deed that expressly stated that the conveyance was subject to the mortgage to the lender and that the grantee expressly assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage obligation as part of the consideration for the purchase. The mortgage was properly described in the deed, and the deed was properly executed by the landowner; however, because there was no provision or place in the deed for the developer to sign, he did not do so. The developer promptly recorded the deed. The developer made the monthly mortgage payments of principal and interest for six payments but then stopped payments and defaulted on the mortgage obligation. The lender properly instituted foreclosure procedures in accordance with the governing law. After the foreclosure sale, there was a $10,000 deficiency due to the lender. Both the landowner and the developer had sufficient assets to pay the deficiency. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction other than the statute relating to foreclosure proceedings. At the appropriate stage of the foreclosure action, which party will the court decide is responsible for payment of the deficiency?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The developer, because he accepted delivery of the deed from the landowner and in so doing accepted the terms and conditions of the deed.\nB. The developer, because he is estopped by his having made six monthly payments to the lender.\nC. The landowner, because the developer was not a signatory to the deed.\nD. The landowner, because he was the maker of the note and the mortgage, and at most the developer is liable only as a guarantor of the landowner's obligation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n The deed stated that the conveyance was subject to the lender's mortgage and that the grantee expressly assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage obligation as part of the consideration. While the developer did not sign the deed, the developer accepted the deed and recorded it, thereby agreeing to the mortgage assumption. When the developer assumed the mortgage obligation, the developer became personally liable to the lender, and the landowner became merely a surety. The developer, having sufficient assets to pay the deficiency judgment, must do so.\n</s>"

The man took a deed to his attorney and told the attorney to deliver the deed to the nephew upon the man's death. The man also told the attorney to return the deed to him if he asked. None of these instructions to the attorney were in writing, and the deed was not recorded. The man then e-mailed the nephew informing him of the arrangement. Shortly thereafter, the nephew died testate. In his will, he devised the farm to his daughter. Several years later, the man died intestate, survived by two sons. The nephew's daughter immediately claimed ownership of the farm and demanded that the attorney deliver the deed to her. Must the attorney deliver the deed to the daughter?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because a gratuitous death escrow is void unless supported by a written contract.\nB. No, because the man never placed the deed beyond his control.\nC. Yes, because the death of the nephew rendered the gratuitous death escrow irrevocable by the man.\nD. Yes, because the deed to the nephew was legally delivered when the man took it to his attorney.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n When the man delivered the deed to his attorney with instructions to deliver it to the nephew on his death, he was attempting to create a valid death escrow. Neither a written nor an oral contract is required for a valid death escrow, since most are gratuitous. To create a valid death escrow, however, the man had to place the deed beyond his control, reserving no power over it once it had been given to the attorney. Because the man instructed the attorney to return the deed to the man if he asked, the man did not place the deed beyond his control, and no death escrow was created. Thus, Answer B is correct.\n</s>"

Eight years ago, the buyer paid the mortgage in full. Seven years ago, the buyer sold the land to an investor by a full covenant and warranty deed without exceptions. Six years ago, the investor gave the land to a donee by a quitclaim deed. Last year, the donee discovered an outstanding mortgage on the land that predated all of these conveyances. As a result of a title examiner's negligence, this mortgage was not disclosed in the title insurance policy issued to the buyer and the bank.

The testator had had two children, a son and a daughter, but only the daughter survived the testator. At the time of the testator's death, the daughter was 30 years old and had two minor children (grandchildren of the testator) who also survived the testator. A third grandchild of the testator, who was the child of the testator's predeceased son, had been alive when the testator executed the will, but had predeceased the testator. Under the applicable intestate succession laws, the deceased grandchild's sole heir was his mother. A statute of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \"If a devisee, including a devisee of a class gift, who is a grandparent or a lineal descendant of a grandparent of the testator is dead at the time of execution of the will or fails to survive the testator, the issue of such deceased devisee shall take the deceased's share under the will, unless the will expressly provides that this statute shall not apply. For this purpose, words of survivorship, such as 'if he survives me,' are a sufficient expression that the statute shall not apply.\" Who now owns the house?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The testator's brother.\nB. The testator's two surviving grandchildren.\nC. The testator's two surviving grandchildren and all other grandchildren who are born to the testator's daughter.\nD. The testator's two surviving grandchildren and the deceased grandchild's mother.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nB\n\n## Explanation\n The testator devised his house, which he owned at his death, to his grandchildren as a class gift. The testator was survived by two grandchildren who became the sole surviving members of the class. The deceased grandchild's interest lapsed because the grandchild, though alive at the time of the will execution, died before the testator. The deceased grandchild would qualify under the anti-lapse statute, but he was not survived by any issue who would be substituted for him under the statute. Thus, Answer B is correct and Answer D is incorrect. Answer A is incorrect because the house will pass to the two surviving grandchildren as surviving members of the class and will not fall into the residue of the estate. Answer C is incorrect because, when the class closed, there were two surviving members of the class, who will take. Additional children of the testator's daughter will not take.\n</s>"

Thereafter, the man died, devising his entire estate to his son.  The wife later removed a light fixture in the dining room of the house and replaced it with a chandelier that was one of her family heirlooms. She then informed her nephew and her late husband's son that after her death, the chandelier should be removed from the dining room and replaced with the former light fixture, which she had stored in the basement. The wife died and under her will bequeathed her entire estate to her nephew. She also named the nephew as the personal representative of her estate. After the nephew, in his capacity as personal representative, removed the chandelier and replaced it with the original light fixture shortly after the wife's death, the son sued to have the chandelier reinstalled. Who will likely prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The nephew, because he had the right to remove the chandelier within a reasonable time after the wife's death.\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of accession.\nC. The son, because the chandelier could not be legally removed after the death of the wife.\nD. The son, because a personal representative can remove only trade fixtures from real property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]\n## Chosen Domain\nProperty\n\n## Chosen Option\nA\n\n## Explanation\n As the life tenant, the wife had a right to annex a chattel, in this case the chandelier. It was clear that the wife did not intend to make the chandelier a permanent annexation, as evidenced by her discussions with her nephew and the man's son. The wife's personal representative, the nephew, had the right to remove the chandelier within a reasonable time after the termination of the wife's life estate. Thus, Answer A is correct and Answer C is incorrect.\n</s>"
