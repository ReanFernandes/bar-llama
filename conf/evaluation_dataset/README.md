Created this to ensure separation between train and test set configs. To create the path for the final inference results to be stored, the dataset label of the original training set must be used, in which case if these configs are present in the 'dataset' config folder, there is a conflict. Thus when running evaluation, these configs must be referenced, before the dataloaded and dataset are called.
