Example 1: 
Question:
 A neighbor frequently visited a woman who lived in the house next to him. The woman was separated from her husband. The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, "Get out." When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and "fight it out." The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, the neighbor should be found

Answer Choices:
A. not guilty, because the neighbor had as much right as the husband to be in the house.
B. not guilty, because the husband attacked the neighbor with a deadly weapon.
C. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.
D. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.

Response:

## Chosen Domain
Criminal_law

## Chosen Option
B

## Explanation
 The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here.

## Chosen Domain
Criminal_law

## Chosen Option
B

## Explanation
 The defendant's intention to kill his neighbor does not amount to an attempt to commit murder without a voluntary action; thus, A and D are wrong. The mistake of fact that the man was not his neighbor is crucial in this fact pattern. Because of the doctrine of transferred intent, the defendant's intent to kill his neighbor transfers to the man when the defendant mistakes the man for the neighbor. Thus, the defendant had the intent to kill the man AND took affirmative steps to carry out the crime by shooting at him (mens rea AND actus reus). Therefore, the man was an intended victim. With regard to the child, the defendant can likely be prosecuted for shooting the child but not for attempted murder because the defendant did not have the requisite intent. Unlike with the man, where he intended to shoot him, the defendant shot the child purely because of distance and bad aim. Thus, C is incorrect.
